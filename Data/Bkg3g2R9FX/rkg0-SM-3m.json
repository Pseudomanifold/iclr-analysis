{"title": "Nice experiments, but theory does not reflect any benefit", "review": "*Summary :\nThe paper explores variants of popular adaptive optimization methods.\nThe idea is to clip the magnitude of the gradients from above and below in order to prevent too aggressive/conservative updates.\nThe authors provide regret bound to this algorithm in the online convex setting and perform several illustrative experiments.\n\n\n*Significance:\n-There is not much novelty in Theorems 1,2,3 since similar results already appeared in Reddi et al.\n\n-Also, the theoretical part does not demonstrate the benefit of the clipping idea. Concretely, the regret bounds seem to be similar to the bounds of AMSBound.\nIdeally, I would like to see an analysis that discusses a situation where AdaGrad/AMSBound fail or perfrom really bad, yet the clipped versions do well.\n\n-The experimental part on the other hand is impressive, and the results illustrate the usefulness of the clipping idea.\n\n*Clarity:\nThe idea and motivation are very clear and so are the experiments.\n\n\n*Presentation:\nThe presentation is mostly good.\n\nSummary of review:\nThe paper suggests a simple idea to avoid extreme behaviour of the learning rate in standard adaptive methods. The theory is not so satisfying, since it does not illustrate the benefit of the method over standard adaptive methods. The experiments are more thorough and illustrate the applicability of the method.\n\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
