{"title": "Interesting work about environment generalization for reinforcement learning", "review": "This paper proposes an \u201cEnvironment-Probing\u201d Interaction (EPI) policy used as an additional input for reinforcement learning (RL). This EPI allows to extract environment representations and implicitly understand the environment in order to improve the generalization on novel testing environments.\n\nPros:\n\nThis paper is well written and clear and the contribution is relevant to ICLR. Although I am not familiar with RL , the contribution seems novel and the model performances are compared with strong and appropriate baselines.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}
