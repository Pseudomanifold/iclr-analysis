{"title": "Input-dependent normalization method", "review": "The authors proposed a normalization method that the rescaling parameters are predicted by the input data. It is shown to use an auto-encoder like network. As the proposed approach uses input-level normalization, it seems to be robust on changing the batch size during training and also showing better performance compared to BN, GN.\n\n(1) In related works (sec 2.2), it mentioned 'Dynamic Layer Normalization' and  the current proposed method looks similar to it. As far as I know, 'Dynamic Layer Normalization' also predicts the rescaling parameters based on the input feature. What are the differences to it?  \n\n(2) This is also related to FILM or conditional batch normalization\n\n(3) The authors introduced in abstract that an auto-encoder like network is used to predict parameters. However, the main context is quite confusing as a 'auto-encoder' network is used. It would be better not to use the term 'auto-encoder' if any reconstructing procedure is not used.", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
