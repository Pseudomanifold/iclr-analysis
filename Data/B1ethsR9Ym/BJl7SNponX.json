{"title": "Modify social attributes on face images results here in low-quality images", "review": "The paper is about changing the attributes of a face image to let it look more aggressive, trustworthy etc. by means of a standalone autoencoder (named ModifAE). The approach is weak starting from the construction of the training set. Since continue social attributes on face images does not exist yet, CelebA dataset is judged by Song et al. (2017) with continuous face ratings and use the predicted ratings to train ModifAE. This obviously introduces a bias driven by the source regression model. The hourglass model is clearly explained. The experiments are not communicating: the to qualitative examples are not the best showcase for the attributes into play (attractive, emotional), and requires to severely magnify the pdf to spot something. This obviously show the Achille\u2019s heel of these works, i.e., working with miniature images. Figure 5, personally, is about who among modifAE and stargan does less bad, since the resulting images are of low quality (the last row speaks loud about that)\nQuantitative results are really speaking user tests, so I will cal it as they are, user tests. They work only on two attributes, and show a reasonable advantage over stargan only for one attribute. \n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
