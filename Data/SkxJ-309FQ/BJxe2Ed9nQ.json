{"title": "interesting analysis", "review": "I think this paper conducts several interesting analysis about MT hallucinations and also proposes several different ways of reducing this effect. My questions are as follows:\n\n* I am very curious about how do you decide the chosen noisy words. I am also wondering what is the difference if you do choose different noisy words. Another thing, if the noisy words are unseen in the training set, will it be treated as \"UNK\"?\n* Can you highlight what is changed in the upper right side of fig.4? It would be great if you include gloss in the figure as well.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
