{"title": "Adversarial examples in NMT", "review": "The authors introduce hallucinations in NMT and propose some algorithms to avoid them. \nThe paper is clear (except section 6.2, which could have been more clearly described) and the work is original. \nThe paper points out hallucination problems in NMT which looks like adversarial examples in the paper \"Explaining and Harnessing Adversarial Examples\". So, the authors might want to compare the perturbed sources to the adversarial examples.\nIf analysis is provided for each hallucination patten, that would be better. \n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
