{"title": "Builds heavily on recent literature. Improves segmentation results, but limited novelty.", "review": "The paper proposes a network architecture for semantic image segmentation. The architecture is based on composing a stack of basic U-Net architectures. After an initial discriminative training of the first portion of the network, the training can be completed end-to-end for the entire network. The second portion of the network entails a dilation. The evaluation of the approach seems to be pretty extensive. The motivation is to build a network that does not heavily rely on pre-trained discriminative networks such as VGG or ResNet, but to build one that is fully targeting the segmentation problem. This approach has led to an architecture that reduces the number of parameters quite significantly while improving results.\n\nThe paper is well organized and sufficiently clear. The results section is pretty rich. \n\nThe technical novelty however is limited. The paper leverages many ideas that have been lingering around, including the most important idea, which is to stack U-Nets. The results do show an improvement (for segmentation) with a clear size decrease of the architecture, but this might not be enough.\n\nI would have appreciated a table showing the training times of the proposed approach in comparison with the previous works.\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
