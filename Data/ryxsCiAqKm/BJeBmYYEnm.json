{"title": "An instance of spectral GCNs on multigraphs", "review": "This paper extends spectral GCN to multigraphs, in which graph size and structure may vary. It builds on Chebnets and extends it to graphs with several relations (more than one edge by pair of nodes).\nWhile the paper is clearly written and is interesting, the contributions are rather incremental and the experimental section does not show a clear improvement wrt the state-of-the-art, neither a clear conclusion on the impact of learning the edges.\n\nMinor comments regarding the experiments:\nThe experimental section may be improved in order to better demonstrate the value of the proposed method.\nAuthors use a standard setting for the experiments: 10 reps. of 10 nested CV on several benchmarked datasets. As pointed out by the authors, some of them contain few samples (mutag). Mean accuracies are reported, but standard deviations are also of interested (difficult to see if a method is better than an other one by comparing avg only). In addition, in table 1, some figures are missing (I believe this is because the methods have not been implemented by the authors). \nRegarding social graphs datasets, this is an issue as the results do not build on the same datasets (for multigraph chebnet, some features are added -- this is not the case for some competitors). \nSome experiments on a image classification context are also provided, but some competitive methods are not evaluated (e.g. PSCN). The bold/underlined+bold should be carefully checked as some wrong figures are highlighted.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
