{"title": "Adding and encoder for the GANs is studied. But the distinctions from existing models are not obvious.", "review": "The paper propose a adversary method to train a bidirectional GAN with both an encoder and decoder. Comparing to the existing works, the main contribution is the introducing of an augmented reconstruction loss by training a discriminator to distinguish the augmentation data from the reconstructed data. Experimental results are demonstrated to show the generating and reconstruction performance.\n\nThe problem studied in this paper is very important, and has drawn a lot of researchers' attentions in recent years.  However, the novelties of this paper is very limited. The techniques used to train a bidirectional GAN are very standard. The only new stuff may be is the proposed reconstruction loss defined on augmented samples and reconstructed ones. But this is also not a big contribution, seems just using a slightly different way to guarantee reconstruction.
