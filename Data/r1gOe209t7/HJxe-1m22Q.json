{"title": "interesting heuristics but no justification either theoretically or empirically", "review": "This paper proposes a special dropout procedure for densenet. The main argument is standard dropout strategy may impede the feature-reuse in Densenet, so the authors propose a pre-dropout technique, which implements the dropout before the nonlinear activation function so that it can be feeded to later layers. Also other tricks are discussed, for example, channel-wise dropout, and probability schedule that assigns different probabilities for different layers in a heuristic way. \n\nTo me this is a mediocre paper. No theoretical justification is given on why their pre-dropout structure could benefit compared to the standard dropout. Why impeding the feature-reuse in the standard dropout strategy is bad? Actually I am not quite sure if reusing the features is the true reason densenet works well in applications.\n\nHeuristic is good if enough empirical evidence is shown, but I do not think the experiment part is solid either. The authors only report results on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. Those are relatively small data sets. I would expect more results on larger sets such as image net.\n\nCifar-10 is small, and most of the networks work fairly well on it. Showing a slight improvement on CIFAR-10 (less than 1 point) does not impress me at all, especially given the way more complicated way of the dropout procedure. \n\nThe result of the pre-dropout on CIFAR-100 is actually worse than the original densenet paper using standard dropout. Densenet-BC (k=24) has an error rate of 19.64, while the pre-dropout is 19.75.\n\nAlso, the result is NOT the-state-of-the-art. Wide-ResNet with standard dropout has better result on both CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, but the authors did not mention it.  \n", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
