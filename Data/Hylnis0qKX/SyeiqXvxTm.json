{"title": "An interesting paper but incremental technical contribution ", "review": "In this paper, the authors propose a novel method of Task-GAN of image coupling by coupling GAN and a task-specific network, which alleviates  to  avoid hallucination or mode collapse. In general, the paper is addressing an important problem but I still have several concerns as follows:\n1. The technical contribution is rather incremental since there exist numerous works on introducing another discriminator to GAN, such as Triple-GAN. \n\n2. Actually, as the authors mentioned, GAN is not an appropriate model for image restoration when  accurate image completion is required. The authors are expected to make comparison with methods not based on GAN framework. \n\n3.  The authors should clarify the details on the Task network since it is non-trivial to model a task. \n\n ", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
