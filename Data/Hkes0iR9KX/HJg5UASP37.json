{"title": "Lack of novelty and poorly executed experiments", "review": "The authors propose a method for learning representations for graphs. The main purpose is the classification of graphs.\n\nThe topic is timely and should be of interest to the ICLR community. \n\nThe proposed approach consists of four parts: \n\nInitial feature transformation\nLocal features aggregation\nGraph pooling\nFinal aggregator\n\nUnfortunately, each of the part is poorly explained and/or a method that has already been used before. For instance, the local feature aggregation is more or less identical to a GCN as introduced by Kipf and Welling. There are now numerous flavors of GCNs and the proposed aggregation function in (2) is not novel. \n\nGraph pooling is also a relatively well-established idea and has been investigated in several papers before. The authors should provide more details on their approach and compare it to existing graph pooling approaches. \n\nNeither (1) nor (4) are novel contributions. \n\nThe experiments look OK but are not ground-breaking and are not enough to make this paper more than a mere combination of existing methods. \n\nThe experiments do not provide standard deviation. Graph classification problems usually exhibit a large variance of the means. Hence, it is well possible that the difference in mean is not statistically significant. \n\nThe paper could also benefit from a clearer explanation of the method. The explanation of the core parts (e.g., the graph pooling) are difficult to understand and could be made much clearer. \n", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
