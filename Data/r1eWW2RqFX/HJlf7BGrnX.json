{"title": "OK paper, but does not seem particularly novel, and experiments seem inconclusive", "review": "Summary:\nThe paper introduces a generative model for point clouds. The main idea is to use an auto-regressive model, essentially a version of pixel-RNN, which generates points one-by-one. In addition, authors use an attention model to handle longer-range interactions.\n\nPros:\n+ The paper is relatively easy to follow.\n+ Developing new generative models for 3D objects and in particular point clouds is clearly a very important problem.\n+ The overall approach of using pixel RNN-like models for this task makes a lot of sense.\n+ Using attention to extract global features also seems reasonable in this context.\n+ Experiments show that the proposed models performance is on par or better than the existing methods (although see cons).\n+ Shape completion is a nice bonus of the model.\n\nCons:\n- Although the approach seems reasonable, it is not entirely clear what is the message of the paper: is it that we should use autoregressive models to generate point clouds, or use the attention / global context?\n- Whether the work is very novel is not clear: both of the main contributions (shape of the generative distribution and using the context / attention) have already been done before (albeit maybe not in exactly the same context).\n- As for the experimental evaluation, since there are no ablation studies, it is hard to see which part of the model is actually important for the performance.\n- One of the major issues with pixelRNN is its scalability. It is inherently sequential and thus does not scale really well to large outputs. Thus it is a bit strange that scalability is not really discussed in the paper.\n- (minor) Figures 2 and 4 are not very helpful.\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
