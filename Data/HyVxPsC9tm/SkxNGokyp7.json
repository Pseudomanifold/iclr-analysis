{"title": "Incremental contribution", "review": "In this paper, the authors propose a dynamic convolution model by exploiting the inter-scene similarity. The computation cost is reduced significantly by reusing the feature map. In general, the paper is present clearly, but the technical contribution is rather incremental. I have several concerns:\n1. The authors should further clarify their advantages over the popular framework of CNN+LSTM. Actually, I did not see it. \n2.  What is the difference between the proposed method and applying incremental learning on CNN?\n3. The proposed method reduced the computation in which phase, training or tesing?\n4. The experimental section is rather weak. The authors should make more comprehensive evaluation on the larger dataset. Currently, the authors only use some small dataset with short videos, which makes the acceleration unnecessary. \n", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
