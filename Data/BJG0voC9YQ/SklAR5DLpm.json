{"title": "Interesting problem and approach; more experimental domains and careful analysis on experiment results would be appreciated.", "review": "Summary:\n\nThis paper proposes a policy evaluation and search method assisted by a counterfactual model, in contrast previous work using vanilla (non-causal) models. With \u201cno model mismatch\u201d assumption the policy evaluation estimator is unbiased. Empirically, the paper compares Guided Policy Search with counterfactual model (CF-GPS) with vanilla GPS, model based RL algorithm and show benefit in terms of (empirical) sample complexity.\n\nMain comments:\n\nThis paper studies several interesting problems: 1) policy learning with off-policy data; 2) model based RL and how to use model to help policy learning. By capturing a nice connection between causal models and MDP/POMDP model with off-policy data, this paper can leverage SCMs to help the model guided policy search in POMDP. The combination of those ideas is novel and enjoyable.\n\nOn the negative side, I find I met several confused points as a reader with more RL background and less causal inference background. It would be better if the authors could clarify what is the prior distribution P(u) and posterior distribution P(u|h) exactly means in terms of CF-PE algorithm and MB-PE algorithm. I would also appreciate if a more detailed proof of corollary 1 and 2 are included in the appendix, and a higher level intuition/justification about those two results in main body. Maybe I am missing these points due to my limited background in causal inference, but I think those clarification can definitely be helpful for RL audience without that much knowledge in causal inference.\n\nThe main theoretical result seems to be based on the assumption of no model mismatch, and I guess here how the model is estimated from sample are ignored, unless I missed anything. Thus I assume the main contribution of this paper should be algorithmic and empirical. I expect to see the empirical study in more domains with more informative results about how this CF model get the benefit of sampling from p(u|h) rather than p(u) (as an evidence to support motivation paragraph on page 5).
