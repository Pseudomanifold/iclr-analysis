{"title": "A technical report about the application of well-known and standard deep learning techniques to character detection/recognition in document images", "review": "This paper lacks any novelty/contribution as it just applies well-known and standard architectures for object detection (SSD) and image classification (LeNet) trained with standard algorithms and losses.\n\nMoreover, I fail to see what is the purpose of the proposed pipeline and it is not clear at all how it may help improving existing OCR engines in any particular scenario (handwriting recognition, printed text, historical documents, etc.). No demonstration or comparison with state of the art is provided. \n\nThe authors claim \u201cThis work is the first to apply modern object detection deep learning approaches to document data\u201d but there are previously published works. For example:\n\nTuggener, Lukas, et al. \"DeepScores--A Dataset for Segmentation, Detection and Classification of Tiny Objects.\" ICPR 2018.\nPacha, Alexander, et al. \"Handwritten music object detection: Open issues and baseline results.\" DAS 2018.\n\nActually, in my opinion Music Object Detection in musical scores would be a much better test-bed/application for the proposed pipeline than any of the datasets used in this paper.  The datasets used in the experimental section seem to be created ad-hoc for the proposed pipeline and do not come from any real world application. \n\nFinally, the presentation of the paper is marginal. Data plots have very bad resolution, there are no captions in any table or figure and they are not correctly referenced within the text. There seem to be also missing content in the last sections which makes them impossible to read/understand.", "rating": "1: Trivial or wrong", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
