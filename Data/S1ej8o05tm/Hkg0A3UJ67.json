{"title": "Object Detection for OCR", "review": "Unfortunately, the work does not introduce new contributions, with the point of the paper provided in the introduction:\nIn our experiments, we show that best performing approaches currently available for object detection\non natural images can be used with success at OCR tasks.\n\nThe work is applying established object detection algorithms to OCR. While the work provides a thorough experimental section exploring trade offs in network hyper-parameters, the application of object detection to the OCR domain does not provide enough novelty to warrant publication.\n", "rating": "2: Strong rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
