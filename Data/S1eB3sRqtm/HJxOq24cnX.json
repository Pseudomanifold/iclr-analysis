{"title": "curvature noise for large batch training in DNNs", "review": "In this paper, the authors propose a method to close the generalization gap that arises in training DNNs with large batch. The author reasons about the effectiveness in SGD small batch training by looking at the curvature structure of the noise. Instead of using the na\u00efve empirical fisher matrix, the authors propose to use diagonal fisher noise for large batch SGD training for DNNs. The proposed method is shown empirically to achieve both comparable generalization and the training speedup compared to small batch training. A convergence analysis is provided for the proposed method under convex quadratic setting. \n\nThe idea of exploring the curvature information in the noise in SGD has been studied in (Hoffer et al. 2017). The difference between this approach and the proposed method in the paper is the use of diagonal fisher instead of the empirical fisher. Although there is convergence analysis provided under convex quadratic setting, I feel that the motivation behind using diagonal fisher for faster convergence is not clear to me, although in the experiment part, the comparison of some of the statistics of diagonal fisher appear similar to the small batch SGD. The intuition of using diagonal fisher for faster convergence in generalization performance is still missing from my perspective. \n\nIn the convergence analysis, as there is a difference between the full fisher and diagonal fisher in the Tr(C\u2019AC) term. It would be interesting to see the effect of how this term play on convergence rate, and also how this term scale with batch size. But this is more of a minor issue as we are mostly caring about its generalization performance which is different from optimization error convergence. \n\nIn the experiments section, the authors claim that noise structure is only important for the first 50 epochs. But it would be better if the authors could show experimental results of using the same training method all the way during the experiment. The experiments are conducted on MNIST and CIFAR10 and 100, which I feel is a bit insufficient for a paper that deals with generalization gap in large batch. As in large batch training, we care more about bigger dataset such as ImageNet, and hence I would expect results reported on various models on ImageNet. Another interesting thing to show would be the generalization error over epochs for different methods, which could give a more detailed characterization of the behavior of different methods.\n\nOverall, I feel the motivation and intuition behind the proposed method is not clear enough and experimental studies are not sufficient for understanding the behavior of the proposed method as an empirical paper.\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
