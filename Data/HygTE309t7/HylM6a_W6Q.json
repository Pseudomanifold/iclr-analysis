{"title": "Review of submission 1492", "review": "Summary: This paper modifies an existing technique designed for image classification to make it applicable to outlier detection. \n\n\nStrengths: The outlined problem is of significant practical importance.\n\nWeaknesses: \n- The improvement over the existing method is incremental; \n- The regularization on routing decision may not really be necessary as, in DNDF, the soft splits start as uniform and gradually converge to something close to hard splits; this is discussed in the supplementary material of the DNDF paper;\n- the datasets tested are standard image datasets, not even captured from vehicles or video surveillance. The SVHN (street view numbers) dataset is the closest the experiments get to the motivating application. \nOverall assessment: reject\n\nRecommendations for the authors: Test on a surveillance or street view benchmark. Even then, it's questionable whether the paper is suitable for ICLR due to lack of methodological novelty.\n\n\nNote: I'd like to apologize to the authors for the delay in submitting this review. It was due to a technical error on my part (I thought the reviews had posted, but they had not). In the spirit of independent evaluation, this review was not influenced by the other comments on this paper. I will follow-up with a response which will take into account the existing dialogue.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
