{"title": "Idea is interesting; realization is graph-specific", "review": "This paper proposes an unsupervised approach to learning node representations. The basic steps are: (1) use an encoder E to learn node vectors, (2) use a readout function R to summarize node vectors into the graph vector, (3) use a scoring function D to score how much the node vectors are aligned with the graph vector, and (4) maximize the scores for the given graph meanwhile minimize the those from the negative distribution.\n\nI feel that the idea is interesting; however, the paper is less well written and the realization of the idea has drawbacks as well.\n\n1. Presentation of Section 3.2 can be improved. The proposed approach becomes clear only toward the end.\n\n2. Naming and wording is misleading. The title and the whole paper use the wording \"mutual information\", whereas in reality, the loss function is a cross entropy.\n\n3. In equation (1), it is unclear why the authors take expectation with respect to the distribution of graphs before summing the scores for one particular graph. Should the order of the expectation and summation be swapped?\n\n4. The proposal is more like a framework than a specific method. The encoder and the negative distribution need to be separately designed for different graphs.\n\nGood things about the proposal:\n\n5. The downstream classification results are quite comparable to those of supervised methods (except for the PPI data).\n\n6. The learned node representations possess a clear clustering structure (Figure 3).\n\nMinor comments:\n\n7. In the third paragraph of section 4.3, the authors state that \"... for the GCN model in the fully supervised setting\". GCN should be a semi-supervised method rather than a fully-supervised one.\n\n8. In the last paragraph of section 4.3, what is a \"randomly initialized graph convolutional network\" and how is it different from the proposal?\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
