{"title": "A sensible approach, but needs to justify the experiments more strongly", "review": "This paper presents an approach of fortifying the neural networks to defend attacks. The major component should be a denoising autoencoder with noise in the hidden layer.\n\nHowever, from the paper, I am still not convinced why this defends the FGSM attack. From my perspective, a more specifically designed algorithm could attack the network described in the paper as the old way, and what is the insight of defending the attacks, whether this objective function is harder to find to adversarial examples, or have to use more adversarial examples?\n\nAnother problem rise from Ian Goodfellow's comment. I am trying not to be biased. So if the author could address his comments properly, I am willing to change the rating.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
