{"title": "An application of YOLO to detect topological defects in 2D active nematics.", "review": "Summary:\nThis paper applies deep learning model YOLO to detect topological defects in 2D active nematics. Experimental results show that YOLO is robust and accurate, which outperforms traditional state-of-the-art defect detection methods significantly.\n\nPros:\n+ Detecting defects in 2D active nematics is an important task to study. \n+ YOLO is effective in object detection and shows good results for defect detection. \n+ The experiment shows that YOLO appears to outperform traditional state-of-the-art defect detection methods. \n\nCons:\n-\tThe technical contribution seems not enough. YOLO is state-of-the-art object detection method and has been widely used. However, this paper directly applies YOLO for this task, while few variants have been specifically designed or modified for the defect detection tasks. \n-\tThe experiments may miss some details. For example, what is the traditional method used for comparison? What is the difference between traditional method and YOLO? The paper should provide some explanations and introductions. \n-\tSince the training data set is imbalanced, does the proposed model utilize some strategy to overcome this problem?\n-\tThe detection rate comparison is not convincing. As shown in the experiments, traditional model and YOLO is operated by different machines, therefore, the detection rate comparison is not convincing.\n-\tThe paper contains some minors. For example, in table 1 and table 2, +1/2 defects should be -1/2.\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
