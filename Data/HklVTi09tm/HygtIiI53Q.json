{"title": "Application of YOLO to images of specific types", "review": "This review will unfortunately be very short because I am afraid there is not much to say about this well written paper, which seems to have been sent to the wrong conference. The scientific problem is interesting, namely the detection of topological artifacts in images showing biological phenomena (which I don\u2019t know much about). The relevant literature here is basically literature from this field, which is not machine learning and not even image processing. The contribution of the paper, in terms of machine learning, is to apply a well known neural model (YOLO) to detect bounding boxes of objects in images, which are very specific. The contribution here does not lie in machine learning, I am afraid.\n\nThis is thus a purely experimental paper on a single application, namely object detection in specific images. Unfortunately the experiments are not convincing. The results are validated against a \u201ctraditional method\u201d, which has never been cited, so we do not know what it is.\n\nThe performance gain obtained with YOLO seems to be minor, although the difference in time complexity is quite enormous (to the advantage of YOLO).\n\nThe contribution is thus minor and for me does not justify publication at ICLR.\n\nThe grant number is mentioned in the acknowledgments, which seems to violate double blind policy.\n", "rating": "2: Strong rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
