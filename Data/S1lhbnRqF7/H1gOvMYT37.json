{"title": "Good ideas and results, could use some work with explanation", "review": "* Summary\nThis paper addresses machine reading tasks involving tracking the states of entities over text. To this end, it proposes constructing a knowledge graph using recurrent updates over the sentences of the text, and using the graph representation to condition a reading comprehension module. The paper reports positive evaluations on three different tasks.\n\n* Review\n\nThis is an interesting paper. The key technical component in the proposed approach is the idea that keeping track of entity states requires (soft) coreference between newly read entities and locations and the ones existing in the knowledge graph constructed so far.\n\nThe proposed method seems plausible, but some details are impressionistic and it is not clear why and whether the modeling choices do what the paper says. This is especially the case in a few places involving coreference:\n1. The paper says at the top of page 6 that the result of Eq 1 is a disambiguated intermediate node representation.\n2. The self attention in Eq 2 performs coreference disamguation which prevents different instances of the same location from being predicted for multiple entities.\n\nWhile these may indeed be working as advertised, it would be good to see some evaluation that verifies that after learning, what is actually happening is coreference.\n\nWhy does the graph update require coreference pooling again?  Don't the updates in Eq 1 and 2 take care of this? The ablation does not test this, right?\n\nAnother modeling choice that is not clear is regarding how the model processes the text -- reading prefixes of the paragraph, rather than one sentence at a time. What happens if the model is changed to be read one sentence at a time?\n\nThat the model implicitly learns constraints from data is interesting!\n   \nBottomline: The paper presents interesting ideas and good results, but would be better if the modeling choices were better explored/motivated.\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
