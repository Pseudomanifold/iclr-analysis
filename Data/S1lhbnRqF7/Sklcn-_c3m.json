{"title": "Contributions are novel and convinced about significance", "review": "The paper addresses a challenging problem of predicting the states of entities over the description of a process. The paper is very well written, and easily understandable. The authors propose a graph structure for entity states, which is updated at each step using the outputs of a machine comprehension system. The approach is novel and well motivated. I will suggest a few improvements: \n\n1. the NPN model seems a good alternative, will be good to have a discussion about why your model is better than NPN. Also, NPN can probably be modified to output spans of a sentence. I will be curious to know how it performs.\n\n2. A more detailed illustration of the system / network is needed. Would have made it much easier to understand the paper. \n\n3. What are the results when using the whole training set of Recipes ?\n\n\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
