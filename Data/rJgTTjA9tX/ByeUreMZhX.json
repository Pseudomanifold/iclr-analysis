{"title": "The Comparative Power of ReLU Networks and Polynomial Kernels in the Presence of Sparse Latent Structure", "review": "In this paper, authors analyze the performance of neural networks and polynomial kernels in a natural regression setting where the data enjoys sparse latent structure, and the labels depend in a simple way on the latent variables. They give an almost-tight theoretical analysis of the performance and verify them with simulations.\n \nAuthors motivated the theoretical analysis from typical applications, for which the desired function can be only important to be approximated well on the relevant part of domains. Instead of formalizing the above problem, authors tackle a particular simple question. However, it is not easy to understand the relationships between the two problems.\n \nA regression task is studied where the data has a sparser latent structure. Authors measure the performance of estimators via the expected reconstruction error from theoretical perspectives for both two-layer ReLU network and polynomial kernel. Empirical experiments will be even better to show the performance of some applications consistent with the theoretical results.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
