{"title": "This paper proposes the Adaptive Neural Trees (ANT) approach to combine the two learning paradigms of deep neural nets and decision trees (DT).", "review": "The presented method is a generalization of a number of existing methods, which can be regarded as special cases. Overall the method seems to be novel. Meanwhile, I have two major questions:\nTo account for the bias issue, instead of a single DT, ensemble methods such as random forests are the popular choices. How ANT could benefit from relying on a single DT instead of a random forest type?\nThe datasets of MNIST and CIFAR-10 are used for many years and the performance is already saturated. As presented in Table.3, the performance of the proposed method is also not the best on either of the tested datasets. Please clearly elaborate on why and how to address this issue. It would be more interesting and meaningful to work with a more recent large datasets, such as ImageNet or MS COCO. \n\nThe response does not fully address my concerns.
