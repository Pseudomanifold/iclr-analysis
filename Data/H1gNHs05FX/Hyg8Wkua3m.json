{"title": "It introduces wavelet reconstruction to the temporal point process literature", "review": "The authors of this paper propose a point process model that uses wavelet reconstruction to capture complicated dependencies between events. They motivate this approach using experiments in the medical domain, which show how certain dependencies between events is better captured by their proposed model. The primary contribution of the paper is novel and could be useful in medical settings where predicting occurrence of important events such heart attacks could be challenging with alternative methods.\n\nA few recommendation for improving the paper besides a few typos that are present in the manuscript (such as first sentence of section 3 where  \"depicted\" is redundant): 1) A more substantive discussion of the challenges one may encounter while training the proposed model and elaborate on the complexity of the inference procedure in comparison with alternatives. For example, training vanilla Hawkes model is relatively easy and efficient, even though it may not perform as good as the proposed model. 2) Presentation of the model in section 3 lacks sufficient explanation and heavily relies on high level remarks on how the model is developed, a more detailed explanation (even including how the wavelet coefficients are computed) could be far more useful than the schematic view of the network architecture presented in Figure 1.\n\nOverall, I think this paper provides a novel contribution for modeling event data specifically for medical data. The ideas are well presented and experiments provide insights in how the proposed model can be useful for forecasting particular medical events. The overall recommendation is to accept the paper, however, I hope authors would address the concerns provided in the previous paragraph.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
