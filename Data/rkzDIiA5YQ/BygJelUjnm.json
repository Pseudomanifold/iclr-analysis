{"title": "The contribution is not clear and significant for accelerating distributed algorithms", "review": "Overall, this paper is well written with clearly presentation.\nHowever, the contribution is not good enough to research the ICLR requirement.\nAlthough the authors propose some method to balance the computation between distributed workers, which should be important for distributed optimization algorithm design, but not enough numerical experiments are proposed to prove the efficiency.\nEven though some convergence analysis is given.\nThe main concern of this paper is to significantly increase the algorithm efficiency, but both theoretical and numerical results are lack of strength.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
