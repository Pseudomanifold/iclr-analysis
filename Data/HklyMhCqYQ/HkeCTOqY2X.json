{"title": "Interesting approach, but experiments are not appropriate", "review": "- Summary\nThis paper proposes a method based on implicit maximum likelihood estimation for single-image super-resolution. The proposed method aims at avoiding common artifacts such as high-frequency noise and shape distortion. The proposed method shows better performance than SRGAN in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and human evaluation of realism on the ImageNet dataset.\n\n- Pros\n  - The proposed method shows better performance than SRGAN in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and human evaluation.\n  - The selection of the evaluation methods is appropriate. In the field of image super-resolution tasks, both signal accuracy (e.g., PSNR) and perceptual quality (e.g., human evaluation) are important.\n\n- Cons\n  - The experiments are conducted thoroughly in the ImageNet, but the selection of the dataset is not appropriate. It would be better to apply the proposed method to other datasets which are used recent papers.\n  - Also, the selection of the methods to be compared is not appropriate. It would be better to provide recent state-of-the-art methods and compare the proposed method with them.\n\nThe proposed approach is interesting and promising, but the selection of the methods and datasets to be compared is not appropriate.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
