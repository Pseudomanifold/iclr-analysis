{"title": "Interesting ideas but experimental evaluation lacking", "review": "The authors propose a method based on successor representations to discover options in a reward-agnostic fashion.  The method suggests to accumulate a set of options by (1) collecting experience according to a random policy, (2) approximating successor representation of or states, (3) clustering the successor representations to yield \u201cproto-typical\u201d cluster centers, and (4) defining new options which are the result of policies learned to \u201cclimb\u201d the successor representation of the proto-typical state.  The authors provide a few qualitative and quantitative evaluations of the discovered options.\n\nI found the method for discovering options reasonable and interesting.  The authors largely motivate the method by appealing to intuition rather than mathematical theory, although I understand that many of the related works on option discovery also largely appeal to intuition.  The visualizations in Figure 5 (left) and Figure 7 are quite convincing.\n\nMy concerns focus on the remaining evaluations:\n\n-- Figure 5 (right) is difficult to understand.  How exactly do you convert eigenoptions to sub-goals?  Is there a better way to visualize this?\n\n-- The evaluation method in Figure 6 seems highly non-standard; the acronym AUC is usually not used in this setting.  Why not just plot the line plots themselves?\n\n-- Figure 8 is very difficult to interpret.  For (a), what exactly is being plotted? SR of all tasks or just cluster centers?  What should the reader notice in this visualization?  For (b), I don\u2019t understand the options presented.  Is there a better way to visualize the goal or option policy?\n\n-- Overall, the evaluation is heavy on qualitative results (many of them on simple gridworld tasks) and light on quantitative results (the only quantitative result being on a simple gridworld which is poorly explained).  I would like to see more quantitative results showing the the discovered options actually help solve difficult tasks.\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
