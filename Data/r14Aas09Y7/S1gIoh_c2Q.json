{"title": "interesting idea that surprisingly works", "review": "+ Interesting and novel idea\n+ It works\n- Insufficient ablation and comparison\n- Unclear what the advantages of the presented framework are\n\nThe presented idea is clearly new and a deviation from standard GAN architectures. I was surprised to see that this actually produces visually coherent results. I was certain that it would create ugly seams at the boundary. For this reason I like the submission overall.\n\nHowever, the submission has two major short-comings. First, throughout the exposition it is never really clear why COCO-GAN is a good idea beyond the fact that it somehow works. I was missing a concrete use case where COCO-GAN performs much better.\n\nSecond, I was missing any sort of ablation experiments. The authors only evaluate the complete system, and never show which components are actually needed. Specifically, I'd have liked to see experiments:\n * with/without a context model Q\n * with a standard discriminator (single output or convolutional), but a micro-coordinate generator\n * with a macro-block discriminator, but a standard generator\n * without coordinate conditioning, but different Generator parameters for each coordinate\n\nThese experiments would help better understand the strength of COCO-GAN and how it fits in with other GAN models.\n\nMinor:\nThe name of the method is not ideal. First, it collides with the COCO dataset. Second, it does not become clear why the proposed GAN uses a \"Conditional Coordinate until late in the exposition. Third, the main idea could easily stand without the coordinate conditioning (see above).", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
