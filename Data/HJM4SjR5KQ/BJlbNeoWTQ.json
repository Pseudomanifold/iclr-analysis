{"title": "summary", "review": "This paper is not very well written. I cannot find what is the main contribution of this paper. For example, equation (1) seems out of the scope of the main discussion of this paper. It does not look a big deal employing EM algorithm for estimating the HMM parameters, but it seems the main technical contribution of the paper.", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
