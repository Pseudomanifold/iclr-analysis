{"title": "Use of mixtures questionable", "review": "The paper is fairly easily understandable in content. The question addressed in the work is very significant as is shown by multiple applications on real datasets in the paper. The reviewer is not aware of any prior work in connection to the question.\nThis work appears to be a first of its kind. However, there are some issues which the reviewer is not clear on.\n1. The penalization criteria enforced leads to sharing of one active component among all connected components of positive weights, irrespective of the magnitude of the weightage, thereby reducing it to a single component mixture distribution for  every connected subgraph of positive weights, which eliminates the need to use a mixture distribution in the first place. It is unclear why the use of mixtures could be useful therein.\n2. Although pairwise maximization for distributions does achieve the results in Proposition 1, however, simultaneous maximization does not guarantee sparsity, unlike as pointed out by the authors. It has not been clearly explained why the results would continue to hold true for pairwise maximization setting.\n3. A regularizer based on the value of the weights rather than only on the sign could prove more effective.\n", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
