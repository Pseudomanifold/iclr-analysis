{"title": "effective method for open set domain adaptation", "review": "This paper tackles the problem of open-set unsupervised domain adaptation with a method based on \nsubspace learning. Specifically the proposed approach searches for two low-dimensional spaces, one shared \nby the known source and target categories while the other is specific for the unknown classes. \n\nOverall the paper is well organized and easy to read. The mathematical formulation of the method is sound and\nclearly explained in all its variants.\n\nI have few concerns \n- it would be good to have the \"average\" columns in the tables reporting the experimental results. This will help to have an overall idea on the performance of the different proposed and baseline methods.\n- it is not clear whether the authors are reporting the results of AODA from the original paper or if they re-ran the code to get the recognition accuracies. For instance in table 3 the result 70.1 for A->W is lower than those reported in the original paper for this setting.\n- the paper does not discuss how the hyperparameters of the methods are chosen. Only an analysis on epsilon is provided. It would be very helpful to understand the procedure used to select the values of alpha, beta and lambda and to evaluate the robustness of the method to those parameters. Moreover,  the value of the dimensionality d is not explicitly indicated in the text. This should be added together with a discussion about if and how the subspace disagreement measure (that was introduced for closed set domain adaptation) is reliable in the open set condition.\n\n\n\n\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
