{"title": "The paper may contain interesting ideas, but lacks clarity, and might have issues with experimental evaluation.", "review": "Summary:\nThis paper introduces a generative model for 3D point clouds. Authors aim at theoretically showing the difficulties of using existing generative models to learn distributions of point clouds, and propose a variant that supposedly solves the issues.\n\nPros:\n+ The problem of designing generative models for 3D data is important.\n\nCons: \n- Paper is often hard to follow, and contains a significant number of typos. \n- Authors claim to identify a fundamental problem with the existing generative models for point clouds, yet Section 2 tries to show that a _specific version_ that uses DeepSet does not satisfy theoretical guarantees. What if we use e.g. a recurrent network instead? As is, the counter example proof itself is quite confusing: it would really help if the proof was more formal.\n- Jointly learning an inference network (Q) has certainly been done before, and I am not sure authors provide an elaborate enough explanation of what is the difference with adversarially learned inference /  adversarial feature learning.\n- It is not clear why authors did not follow the evaluation protocol of [Achlioptas\u201917] or [Wu\u201916] more closely. In particular, evaluation for the classification task should be compatible with the proposed model, which would give a much better picture of the learned representations.\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
