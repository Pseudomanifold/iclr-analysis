{"title": "poor organization, trivial techical implementation", "review": "In this paper, the authors have proposed a cross domain transferring methods, supervised by three category of losses. The experiments somewhat demonstrate the effective of this method. However, this paper still suffers from some drawbacks as below:\nThe paper is not well-organized, the structure of the paper need improving. For example, the related work is put almost at the end of the paper and the tables and figures are hard to follow sometimes.\nThe technical implementation of the proposition is somewhat trivial. Why the generative model should be pre-trained. Why not try in the end-to-end way. \nThe experiments are not convincing. The authors argue that CycleGAN suffers from some drawback. Why do not the authors compare with CycleGAN in this paper? By the way, the authors also need to compare with more state-of-the-art methods, such as StarGAN.\nSome implementation details are not clearly stated. For example, the authors say \u201cOur goal can thus be stated as learning transformations that preserve locality and semantic alignment, while requiring as few labels from a user as possible.\u201d So, how many labeled samples are used in Table 2?", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
