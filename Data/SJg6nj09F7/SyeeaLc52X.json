{"title": "using REINFORCEMENT LEARNING for NEURAL MALWARE CONTROL", "review": "This paper uses deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for malware detection. It can get better performance than LSTM or GRU based models.\n\nDeep reinforcement learning (DRL) has already used for classification or detection. I am not sure about the main contribution of this work. The new application of DRL can not convince me.\n\nAs the dataset is not a public dataset, it is difficult to evaluate the performance. As for the comparing models, i think some CNN based methods should be included. If the task is a detection, i think some attention methods should also be investigated and compared. LSTM combined with attention should already be well investigated in other classification/detection tasks.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}
