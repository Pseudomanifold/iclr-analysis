{"title": "The novelty is limited and the empirical study is not convincing.", "review": "My major concerns are as follows.\n1. Authors propose a new loss function in Eqn.17 which simply combines lifted structure loss and binomial deviance loss.\n2. The comparison is not sufficient. For the loss function, authors only compare it to binomial in Table 1 where the improvement is not significant on two datasets. Authors should include the performance of lifted structure loss which is the other block in their new loss.\n3. The improvement in Table 2&3 is suspect. Baseline methods use either different backbone network or different size of embedding (usually with smaller size). For example, 'Sampling'('Margin' in tables?) uses a simplified ResNet-50 and the size of embedding is 128. The size of embedding in 'Proxy-NCA' is only 64 while this work uses 512. \n4. The parameters in the experiments seem quite sensitive. For example, they use $K=4$ on two data sets and $K=5$ on the others. Can authors elaborate how they tune the parameters?", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
