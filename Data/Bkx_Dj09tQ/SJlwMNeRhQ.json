{"title": "Review of Causal importance of orientation selectivity for generalization in image recognition", "review": "COMMENTS RELATED TO REVISION:\nThe new analysis that has been added takes a step towards getting at the relationship to invariance. This is a positive. In general comments, the authors state as important contributions: \n\n\"1) to the debate on the harmfulness/importance of selectively activated units in DNNs [1-3] by presenting concrete examples where selectivity is important for generalization, and 2) to the neuroscience community, where, although orientation selectivity has been extensively analyzed for these 60 years since [4], its functional importance in a natural environment has remained unanswered.\"\n\nOn point 2, while this provides an example of an artificial network where orientation plays an important role, it's a stretch to generalize this to conclusions concerning functional importance in neuroscience.\n\nOne point 1, I agree that this paper takes steps in the right direction, but ultimately the overall conclusions still feel as though they are a natural and implied consequence of limiting orientation selectivity. It is noted that  orientation selectivity is \"not just a superficial byproduct of object recognition, but is causally indispensable for object recognition\". The idea that selectivity for oriented edges is indispensible for object recognition again is a conclusion that feels as though it would be shocking if this were not true. The notion of it being a superficial byproduct of object recognition presupposes that the purpose of the system is to recognize objects. Again, it would be surprising if there were vestigial features in the network that are learned, but play no important role - especially among early layers. \n\nI think the paper might be strengthened by re-working this second point to more strongly establish the causality the authors claim. \n\nORIGINAL COMMENTS:\nThis paper presents interesting analysis and an ablation study on orientation selectivity in neural networks. This is analyzed with respect to generalization performance in decisions made. Overall, the paper is well written and interesting. However, I have a number of comments / concerns as described below:\n\nPositives:\n- The paper presents an in depth analysis of the role of orientation selectivity in neural hierarchies. This style of analysis is sorely lacking and fits the theme of learning representations\n- The paper itself is well written and quite polished\n- The authors have taken great care to rule out any possible confounds through experiments that are not identical to the main claims or objective (specifically the study of section 3.3)\n\nTo address:\n- The only concern I have (and it is somewhat significant), is the notion of \"generalization\". This is a rather loaded term, and it is not clear on cursory inspection where this generalization comes from. Is it a function of invariance among higher layers to scene geometry? What are the fundamental underpinnings of these observations outside of correlation to orientation selectivity.\n- It seems almost a tautology that removing orientation selectivity would impair performance. I would be more satisfied, and render a higher rating if I felt there was a \"smoking gun\" with respect to evidence. The conclusion is convincing, but the reasoning comes across as somewhat vague. With that said, it is also understood that this is a non-trivial matter to address and perhaps this paper is an important first step.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
