{"title": "I don't think the theoretical results represent a significant advance", "review": "The writing and organization of the paper are clear.  Theorem 1 seems fine but is straightforward to anyone who has studied this topic and knows the literature.  Corollary one may be technically wrong (or at least it doesn't follow from the theorem), though this can be fixed by replacing the lim with a limsup.  Theorem 4 seems to be the main result all the work is leading up to, but I think this is wrong.  Stronger conditions are required on the sequence \\beta_t, along the lines discussed in the paragraph on Boltzmann exploration in Section 2.2 of Singh et al 2000.  The proof provided by the authors relies on a \"Lemma 2\" which I can't find in the paper.  The computational results are potentially interesting but call for further scrutiny.  Given the issues with the theoretical results, I think its hard to justify accepting the paper.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
