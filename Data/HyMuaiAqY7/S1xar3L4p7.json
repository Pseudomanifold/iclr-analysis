{"title": "Straightforward combination of prior works with no theory and weak experiments", "review": "This paper is a straightforward combination of two previous works, Deli-GAN and Fisher GAN. Deli-GAN has a mixture prior distribution in the latent space, while Fisher GAN uses Fisher IPM instead of JSD as objective.\nInception score on CIFAR-10 is used to empirically measure quality.\n\nCons:\nThe exposition of the ideas is lacking. What's wrong with Deli-GAN? What is this paper trying to accomplish by incorporating fisher metric?\nNo theoretical justification while empirical results are sparse and unconvincing.\nWriting quality could be improved throughout the paper in terms of both structure and language.  \n\nIn summary, this paper is not of the quality that should be accepted by ICLR.
