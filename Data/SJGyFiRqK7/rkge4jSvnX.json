{"title": "Intellectual exercise of limited value to the community", "review": "The paper proposes an alternative to commonly used ReLU activated networks. The \"gating\" and \"amount\" effects of the weights are decoupled. The authors claim that such architectures are easier to theoretically understand. That might be the case indeed, but I fail to see much value in obtaining such understanding of very contrived objects that are not being used in practice. Unless such architectures can be proven to be interesting from a practical standpoint I do not think there is much of a point in studying them. The argument provided by the authors that they can - in a simple situation - have as much expressive power as a standard ReLU activated architecture is insucfficient, in my opinion, to justify researching them. Also, if a strong, deep theorem was proven using GaLU networks was proven, I would be inclined to recommend the paper to be accepted. As is - I do not find the paper to be a contribution significant enough for ICLR.", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
