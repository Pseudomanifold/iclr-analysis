{"title": "A good step in learning Navier-Stokes equations, but lack compelling results", "review": "+ An interesting idea to learn the hidden state evolution and the state-observation mapping jointly\n+ The experiments on Euler's equation are slightly better than ResNet for 30 steps ahead forecasting in terms of MSE\n+ The paper is clearly written and well-explained\n\n- The model is not new: ResNet for state evolution and  Conv-Deconv for state-observation mapping\n- The difference between ResNet and the proposed framework is not significant, ResNet is even better in Figure 2\n- Missing an important experiment:  test whether the model can generalize, that is to forecast on different initial conditions than the training dataset\n- How does the model compare with GANs (Y.
