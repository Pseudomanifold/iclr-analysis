{"title": "Some questions in lieu of a review, for now", "review": "I feel like I am missing something about this paper, so rather than a review, this is just mainly a long question making sure I understand things properly.  Ignore the score for now, I'll change once I get a clearer picture of what's happening here.\n\nThe network you propose in this paper is motivated by solving PDEs where, as in (1), the actual solution as they are computed numerically depends on the current spatial field of the state, as well as difference operators over this field (e.g., both the gradients and the Laplacian terms).  So, I naturally was assuming that you'd be designing a network that actually represented state as a spatial field, and used these difference operators in computing the next state.  But instead, it seems like you reverted to the notion of \"because difference operators can be expressed as convolutions, we use a convolutional network\", and I don't really see anything specific to PDEs thereafter, just general statements about state-space models.\n\nAm I understanding this correctly?  Why not just actually use the PDE-based terms in the dynamics model of an architecture?  Why bother with a generic ResNet? (And I presume you're using a fully convolutional ResNet here?)  Wouldn't the former work much better, and be a significantly more interesting contribution that just applying a ResNet and a generic U-Net as a state estimator?  I'm not understanding why the current proposed architecture (assuming I understand it correctly) could be seen as \"PDE guided\" in all but the loosest possible sense.  Can you correct me if I'm misunderstanding some element here?", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
