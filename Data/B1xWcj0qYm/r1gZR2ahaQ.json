{"title": "An interesting contribution and a thorough review of the existing work in the field", "review": "The authors propose an unbiased estimator that allows for training models with weak supervision on two unlabeled datasets with known class priors. The theoretical properties of the estimator are discussed and an empirical evaluation shows promising performance.\n\nThe paper provides a thorough overview of the related work.\nThe experiments compare to the relevant baselines.\n\nMinor remarks:\n\nThe writing seems like it could be improved in multiple places and the main thing that makes some sections of the paper hard to follow is that the concepts often get mentioned and discussed before they are formally defined/introduced. Concepts that are introduced via citations should also be explained even if not in-depth.\n\nFigure 2: the curves suggest that the models should have been left to train for a longer time - some of the small PN and small PN prior-shift risks are still decreasing\n\nFigure 2: the scaling seems inconsistent - the leftmost subplot in each row doesn\u2019t start at (0,0) in the lower left corner, unlike the other subplots in each row - and it should probably be the same throughout - no need to be showing the negative space.\n\nFigure 2: maybe it would be good to plot the different lines in different styles (not just colors) - for BW print and colorblind readers\n\nFor small PN and small PN prior-shift, the choice of 10% seems arbitrary. At what percentage do the supervised methods start displaying a clear advantage - for the experiments in the paper?\n\nWhen looking into the robustness wrt noise in the training class priors, both are multiplied by the same epsilon coefficient. In a more realistic setting the priors might be perturbed independently, potentially even in a different direction. It would be nice to have a more general experiment here, measuring the robustness of the proposed approach in such a way.\n\n5.2 typo: benchmarksand ; datasetsfor", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
