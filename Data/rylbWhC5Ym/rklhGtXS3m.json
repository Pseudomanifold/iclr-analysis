{"title": "Introduces a new variation on TD. Empirical results are not done well enough to support the claims of an improvement.", "review": "The paper introduces HR-TD, a variation of the TD(0) algorithm. The variant is meant to ameliorate a problem of \u2018over-generalization\u2019 with conventional TD. This problem is briefly characterized, but primarily it is presumed to be established by prior work. The algorithm is simple and a series of experiments are presented with it applied to Mountain Car, Acrobot, and Atari Pong, with both linear function approximation and neural networks (DDQN). It is claimed that the results establish HR-TD as an improvement over TD. However, I found the results unconvincing because they were statistically insufficient, methodologically flawed, and too poorly presented for me to be confident of the meaning of numbers reported. In addition, it is not hard to imagine very simple problems where the HR-TD technique would be counterproductive, and these cases were not included in the experimental testbeds.\n\nThe first weakness of the paper is with its characterization of the problem that it seeks to solve: over-generalization. This problem is never really characterized in this paper. It instead refers instead to two other papers, one published only in a symposium and the other with no publication venue identified.\n\nThe second weakness of the paper is the claim that it has done a theoretical analysis in Section 4.4. I don\u2019t see how this section establishes anything of importance about the new method.\n\nThe problem with the main results, the empirical results, is that they do not come close to being persuasive. There are many problems, beginning with there simply not being clear. I read and reread the paragraphs in Section 5.1, but I cannot see a clear statement of what these numbers are. Whatever they are, to assess differences between them would require a statistical statement, and there is none given. Moreover to give such a statistical statement would require saying something about the spread of the results, such as the empirical variance, but none is given. And to say something about the variance one would need substantially more than 10 runs per algorithm. Finally, there is the essential issue of parameter settings. With just one number given for each algorithm, there are no results or no statement about what happens as the parameters are varied. Any one of these problems could render the results meaningless; together they surely are.\n\nThese problems become even greater in the larger problems.\n\nA nice property of HR-TD is that it is simple. Based on that simplicity we can understand it as being similar to a bias toward small weights. Such a bias could be helpful on some problems, possibly on all of those considered here. In general it is not clear that such a bias is a good idea, and regular TD does not have it. Further, HR-TD does not do exactly a bias to small weights, but something more complicated. All of these things need to be teased apart in careful experiments. I recommend small simple ones. \n\nHow about a simple chain of states that are passed through reliably in sequence leading to a terminal state with a reward of 1000 (and all the other rewards 0). Suppose all the states have the same feature representation. If gamma=1, then all states have value 1000, and TD will easily learn and stick at this value even for large alpha, but HR-TD will have a large bias toward 0, and the values will converge to something significantly less than the true value of 1000. \n\nThat would be an interesting experiment to do. Also good would be to compare HR-TD to a standard bias toward small weights to see if that is sufficient to explain the performance differences.", "rating": "2: Strong rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
