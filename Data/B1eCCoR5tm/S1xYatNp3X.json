{"title": "low technical novelty, but interesting results", "review": "Pros:\n-- Superior empirical results are the key highlights of this paper.\n-- The experiments are well designed and benchmarked against the state-of-the-art models.\n\nCons:\n-- One typically uses affine transformations of the training images to improve the performance of the CNN. From that perspective, the paper does not offer any new insight. I am not entirely convinced that this is a novel enough contribution to be accepted in ICLR.\n-- The \"ensemble of ensembles\" approach described in Section 3.5 is not clear. \n-- Overall, the paper does not have much novelty, but the results are quite promising.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
