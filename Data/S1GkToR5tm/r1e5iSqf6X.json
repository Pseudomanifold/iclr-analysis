{"title": "Good paper!", "review": "This paper proposes a rejection sampling algorithm for sampling from the GAN generator. Authors establish a very clear connection between the optimal GAN discriminator and the rejection sampling acceptance probability. Then they explain very clearly that in practice the connection is not exact, and propose a practical algorithm. \n\nExperimental results suggest that the proposed algorithm helps the increase the accuracy of the generator, measured in terms of inception score and Frechet inception distance. \n\nIt would be interesting though to see if the proposed algorithm buys anything over a trivial rejection scheme such as looking at the discriminator values and rejecting the samples if they fall below a certain threshold. This being said, I do understand that the proposed practical acceptance ratio in equation (8) is 'close' to the theoretically justified acceptance ratio. Since in practice the learnt discriminator is not exactly the ideal discriminator D*(x), I think it is super okay to add a constant and optimize it on a validation set. (Equation (7) is off anyways since in practice the things (e.g. the discriminator) are not ideal). But again, I do think it would make the paper much stronger to compare equation (8) with some other heuristic based rejection schemes.\n\n ", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
