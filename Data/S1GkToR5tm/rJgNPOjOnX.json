{"title": "A post-processing method to filter \u2018good\u2019 generated samples for GANs ", "review": "This paper proposed a post-processing rejection sampling scheme for GANs, named Discriminator Rejection Sampling (DRS), to help filter \u2018good\u2019 samples from GANs\u2019 generator. More specifically, after training GANs\u2019 generator and discriminator are fixed; GANs\u2019 discriminator is further exploited to design a rejection sampler, which is used to reject the \u2018bad\u2019 samples generated from the fixed generator; accordingly, the accepted generated samples have good quality (better IS and FID results). Experiments of SAGAN model on GMM toys and ImageNet dataset show that DRS helps further increases the IS and reduces the FID.\n\nThe paper is easy to follow, and the experimental results are convincing. However, I am curious about the follow questions.\n\n(1)\tBesides helping generate better samples, could you list several other applications where the proposed technique is useful? \n\n(2)\tIn the last paragraph of Page 4, I don\u2019t think the presented Discriminator Rejection Sampling \u201caddresses\u201d the issues in Sec 3.2, especially the first paragraph of Page 5.\n\n(3)\tThe hyperparameter gamma in Eq. (8) is of vital importance for the proposed DRS. Actually, it is believed the key to determining whether DRS works or not. Detailed analysis/experiments about hyperparameter gamma are considered missing. \n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
