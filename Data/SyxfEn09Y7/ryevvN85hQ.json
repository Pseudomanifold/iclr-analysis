{"title": "good paper", "review": "The paper proposes SGD for ReLU networks. The authors focuses on positive scale invariance of ReLU which can not be incorporated by naive SGD. To overcome this issue, a positively scale-invariant space is first introduced. The authors show the SGD procedure in that space, which is based on three component techniques: skeleton method, inverse-chain rule, and weight allocation.\n\nThe basic idea, directly optimizing weight in scale invariant space, is reasonable and would be novel, and experiments verify the claim. Readability might be low slightly.\n\nAnalysis about invariance group (e.g., theorem 3.6) is interesting and informative.\n\nCombining with other optimization algorithms (other than simple SGD) method would be valuable.\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}
