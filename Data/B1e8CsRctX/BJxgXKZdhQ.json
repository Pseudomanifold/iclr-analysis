{"title": "Interesting combination of the previous work with useful results.", "review": "The authors present an OOD detection scheme with an ensemble of generative models. When the exact likelihood is available from the generative model, the authors approximate the WAIC score. For GAN models, the authors compute the variance over the discriminators for any given input. They show that this method outperforms ODIN and VIB on image datasets and also achieves comparable performance on Kaggle Credit Fraud dataset.\n\nThe paper is overall well-written and easy to follow. I only have a few comments about the work.\n\nI think the authors should address the following points in the paper.\n- What is the size of the ensemble for the experiments?\n- How does the size of the ensemble influence the measured performance?\n- It is Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM), not FSGM. See [1]. Citing [1] for FGSM would also be appropriate.\n\nQuality. The submission is technically sound. The empirical results support the claims, and the authors discuss the failure cases. \nClarity. The paper is well-written and easy to follow while providing useful insight and connecting previous work to the subject of study.\nOriginality. To the best my knowledge, the proposed approach is a novel combination of well-known techniques.\nSignificance. The presented idea improves over the state-of-the-art.\n\n\nReferences\n[1] I.
