{"title": "This is an interesting paper on the application of GAN in generating order data.  The evaluation and assumptions used in the paper need further justifications.", "review": "The objective of this paper is to use GAN for generating the order stream of stock market data.   The novelty of the paper is the formulation of the order stream and the use of GAN for generating the stock data.   This is a paper for the application of GAN and there are limited contribution to the technical aspect of machine learning.    The paper is clearly written.   There are two main assumptions used in the paper; one is the Markov chain and the second one is the stationary distribution.   In real case, both assumptions are unlikely  to be satisfied.  The orders are mostly affected by many external factors and financial data are known to be non-stationary.  The authors may have to justify these assumptions. \n\nAnother issue is the evaluation of the results.  The paper uses five statistics to evaluate the generated data.  What we can conclude is that the generated data follow similar statistics with the real data.   But we do not know if the generated data offer extra information about the market.  The paper has used synthetic data in the experiments.  So it means that we could have models that generate data that look like real data.  If so, what are the benefits of using GAN to generate the data ?  \n\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
