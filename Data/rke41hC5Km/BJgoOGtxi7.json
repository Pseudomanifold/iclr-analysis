{"title": "Authors did not care about reproducibility and comparison to baselines", "review": "The problem addressed in this paper is worth the attention of the community. Not so much for it being of strong interest to the majority of ICLR attendees, but due to the fact that it deals with data of origin (finance) and properties (high-order Markov chain dependencies) that have never been considered in the past.\n\nHowever, apart from this merit, the paper as is stands now suffers from major prohibitive shortcomings. Specifically, the authors have failed to provide a detailed account of the novel network architecture introduced in this paper. Their description is too vague, and misses crucial details. For instance, they use a convolutional structure (layer?) at some point. How is this configured? Why do they need a convolutional layer, since they present it with a vector output from a preceding dense layer? What about the CDA network (both its configuration and its training procedure)? These are crucial aspects that the authors have failed to describe at all.\n\nIn the same vein, technical details concerning the selection of the training algorithm hyper-parameters are also missing from the experimental section. Although not as glaring an omission as the previously described ones, these are also crucial for the replicability of the presented research results. \n\nFinally, the authors have failed to provide comparisons to alternative baselines. For instance, why not train a simple LSTM and use to generate new samples. Why not use a recurrent variational autoencoder? Eventually, since the time-series we are dealing with are governed by a high-order Markov chain, we not fit and sample from a high-order hidden Markov model? These are crucial questions that must be adequately addressed by the authors.
