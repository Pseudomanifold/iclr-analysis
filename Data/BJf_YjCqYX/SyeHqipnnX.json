{"title": "The paper uses computer graphics simulation for determining bias in commercial Face detection systems.  Specifically, skin type, age, head pose, expression parameters are varied to generate the data. Efficient exploration of simulation parameter space is done by using Bayesopt. ", "review": "Quality and Clarity:  The paper is clear and has comprehensive references to the recent literature and past literature on face detection, bias in computer vision data and systems.  \nOriginality:   Since the main claim of the paper is about the use of graphics simulation for performance characterization, we recommend that the authors review past work on use of simulations for systems performance characterization.  The idea of using simulations to perform performance assessment of vision goes back to the 90's (see for instance: haralick et al (haralick.org, performance characterization papers). The idea of using computer graphics simulations for transfer learning and performance assessment has been revisited recently (see for instance: veerasavarappu et al, 2015-17, arxiv papers, cvpr 2017, wacv 2017). \n\nSignificance:  While the paper demonstrates the utility of the main idea, the results are not comprehensive and can be strengthened.  For instance, the authors state that simulations can be used to combat bias via training with augmented data.   My opinion is that the paper may be more well suited in a applied workshop/conference such as WACV.
