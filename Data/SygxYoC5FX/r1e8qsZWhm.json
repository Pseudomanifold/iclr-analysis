{"title": "Novelty of the paper seems to be marginal", "review": "This paper studied learning unsupervised inductive node embeddings with an attention mechanism. For each positive edge, multiple different sets of neighborhoods are sampled for both the source and target nodes, and the similarity between the neighborhood are used as the attention functions. Experimental results prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach over GraphSAGE on a few networks. \n\nStrength:\n- learning unsupervised inductive node embeddings is an important problem\n- the proposed method seems to work\n\nWeakness:\n- the novelty of the proposed method seems to be very marginal\n- the experiments are quite weak\n- the complexity of the algorithm seems to be very high\n\nDetails:\n- the complexity of the algorithm seems to be very high seem for each pair of nodes, multiple sets of neighborhoods must be sampled for each node.\n- there are also other approaches for inductive unsupervised node embeddings, for example, the varitional graph autoencoder method (Kipf et al. 2017).\n- I am wondering how the proposed method performs comparing with the methods of only selecting the nodes which form triangles with the given positive edges. \n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
