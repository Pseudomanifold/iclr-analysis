{"title": "Overall quality is not high.", "review": "This paper proposes a new representation learning method for graphs.\n\nQuality:\nThe quality of the paper is not high due to vague presentation of the proposed method (see clarity).\nMoreover, there is no theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation is not thorough (see significance).\n\nClarity:\nThis paper is not clearly written and many parts are unclear.\n- In Introduction, what are \"the first issue\" and \"the second issue\"?\n- There are many grammatical mistakes (such as missing articles and the third-person singular -s) and mistakes of mathematical notations.\n- Too many symbols are not mathematically defined and it is hard to understand the paper. The current version is not appropriate for publication.\n\nOriginality:\nThe proposed method is a minor extension of the existing method GraphSAGE. Hence the originality is not high.\n\nSignificance:\n- There is no theoretical analysis of the proposed method. Hence the significance is not high.\n  In particular, the advantage of the proposed method compared to the existing approach (GraphSAGE) should be theoretically analyzed.\n- How to set parameters in practice? The performance of the proposed method will be greatly affected by parameter setting.\n  In experiments, the sensitivity of the proposed method with respect to parameter changes should be analyzed.  \n\nPros:\n- The relevant problem is studied.\nCons:\n- Presentation is not good.\n- Theoretical analysis is not given.\n- Empirical analysis is not thorough.\n\nOther comments:\n- P.3, L.5 in Sec.3: \"G = {V, E, X}\" should be \"G = (V, E, X)\"\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
