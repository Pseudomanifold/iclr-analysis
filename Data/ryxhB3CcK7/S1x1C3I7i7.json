{"title": "A good piece of work", "review": "The paper presents a new approach for performing visual query answering. System responses are programs that can explain the truth value of the answer.\nIn the paper, both the problems of learning and inference are taken into account.\nTo answer queries, this system takes as input an image and a question, which is a set of word from a given vocabulary. Then the question is modeled by a plan (a series of operation that must be performed to answer the query).  Finally, the found answer with the plan are returned. To learn the parameters of the model, the examples are tuples composed by an image, a question, the answer, and the program.\nExperiments performed on the SHAPES dataset show good performance compared to neural model networks by Johnson et al.\n\nThe paper is well written and clear. I have not found any specific problems in the paper, the quality is high and the approach seems to me to be new and worth studying.\nThe discussion on related work seems to be good, as well as the discussion on the results of the tests conducted.\n\nOn page 5, in equation (3) it seems to me that something is missing in J. Moreover, In Algorithm 1, in lines 4 and 9, the B after the arrow should be written in italic.\n\nOverall, there are several typos that must be corrected. I suggest a double check of the English. For example:\n- page 3, \"as modeling *uncertaintly* should...\"\n- page 6, \"Given this goal, we *consrtuct* a latent *varible* ...\"\n- page 8, in paragraph \"Effect of optimizing the true ELBO\", the word \"that\" is repeated twice in the 3rd row\n- page 13, \"for the\" repeated twice in \"Moving average baseline\" paragraph. Also, in the last line of this paragraph, the sentence seems incomplete.\n\n\n\nPros\n- The results are convincing\n- The approach is clearly explained\n\nCons\n- English must be checked", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
