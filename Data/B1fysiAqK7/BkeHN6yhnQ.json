{"title": "Overall score 6", "review": "1. This paper presents a novel approach for training efficient binary networks with both binary weights and binary activations and verifies the capability of the proposed method on benchmark. In addition, related bach normalization and pooling layers are also improved.\n\n2. How long do we need for training BNNs using the proposed method?\n\n3. The paper only compares their performance with only one related work (Hubara et al., 2016), which is somewhat insufficient.\n\n4. Another only concern is that whether the proposed method can be well applied on large scale datasets such as ImageNet.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
