{"title": "Practically good but technically weak.", "review": "Summary\nThis paper proposes an end-to-end learnable  multiview stereo depth estimation network, which is basically very similar to the GCNet (Kendall et.al 2017) or PSMNet (Chang et.al 2018) for stereo estimation. The differences are using SPN to warp feature w.r.t RT, adding a multi view averaging cost and a cost aggregation component for final depth regression, which transform the original network to support multi-view stereo, yielding performance boost over other baselines.\n\nTechnically, I believe it is sound  because cost volume from stereo matching has already been demonstrate very effective in boosting performance because it use underlining geometry constraint.  My major concern lies in three aspects. \n\n1) Another most recent SOTA algorithm is  MVSNet (Yao et.al ECCV 2018), the paper should be considered for comparison. In addition, the structure is even more similar with the proposed network architecture.  \n\n2) The evaluation metrics are mostly use for single view depths, it is not consistent with paper of DeepMVS (Tab. 1) or that from MVSNet. Therefore, it might be hard to actual understand whether the numbers are  exactly comparable. \n\n3) Since the method largely improved over their baseline algorithms, and the number between different papers are hard to compare. In my opinion, to better show the results,  I suggest submitting results to an online benchmark with test data for verifying the results. such as ETH3D multi view benchmark, where everything is standardized. \n\nI hope the author can make strong feedback for validating the results. \n\n####### . After rebuttal\n\nThe author makes more clear indication of the performance contribution of the completeness of recovery.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
