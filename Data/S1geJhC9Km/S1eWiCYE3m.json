{"title": "The presentation is unclear ", "review": "This paper presents a feature quantization technique for logistic regression, which has already been a common practice in \n many finance applications.  The text feels rushed. From the current presentation, I find it difficult to understand what is the motivation of adopting the proposed relaxation of the optimization method, and how is the neural network-based estimation strategy connected to the logistic regression model. It seems the difference lies in the parameterized nonlinear transformation such that the cutting points can be somehow optimized.  The quality of the experiments performed is way below the expectation for ICLR. Although numerical experiments are performed on both simulated data and credit scoring data, it is still unclear whether the proposed method has superiority over competitors.  \n\nQuestion: In the test phase, how would the proposed method handle features that are not seen in the training phase?
