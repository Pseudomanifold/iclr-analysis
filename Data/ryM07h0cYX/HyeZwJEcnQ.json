{"title": "paper review", "review": "The authors use RPO (Shulman et al, 2015) to transform non-differentiable operations in Faster R-CNN such as NNS, RoIPool, mAP to stochastic but differentiable operations. They cast Faster R-CNN as a SCG which can be trained end-to-end. They show results on VOC 2007.\n\nPros:\n(+) The idea of casting a non-differentiable pipeline into a stochastic one is very reasonable\n(+) This idea is showcased for a hard task, rather than toy examples, thus making it more realistic and exciting\nCons:\n(-) Results are rather underwhelming\n(-) Important properties of the final approach, such as complexity (time, memory, FLOPs) are not mentioned at all\n\nWhile the idea the authors present seems reasonable and is showcased for a hard problem, such as object detection and on a well-designed system such as Faster R-CNN, the results are rather underwhelming. The proposed approach does not show any significant gains on top of the original pipeline (for ResNet101 the reported gains are < 0.2%). These small gains come at the expense of a more complicated definition and training procedure. The added complexity is not mentioned by the authors, such as time, memory requirements and FLOPs. In addition, the VOC2007 benchmark is rather outdated and much smaller than others. It would be nice to see similar results on COCO, which is larger and more challenging. \n\nSimilar efforts in this direction, namely making various modules of the Faster R-CNN pipeline differentiable, have shown little gains as well. For example, Dai at al., CVPR 2016, convert RoIPool into RoIWarp (following STN, Jaderberg et al) that allows for differentiation with respect to the box coordinates.
