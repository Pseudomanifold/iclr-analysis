{"title": "Review", "review": "The paper proposes a novel network architecture for classification problems that is based on decomposing the network into two parts classed the advocates and the judge. The advocates learn by competing with each other to provide a judge-convincing \"evidence\" -- an attention map over the input that supposedly highlight the most class-relevant parts of the input.\nI find the very general idea interesting because it could potentially help to improve interpretability of neural networks by explicitly putting in the network a corresponding bottleneck.\nHowever, in its current form the approach has a number of drawbacks:\n\n1) The input to the judge network scales linearly with the number of classes which potentially prevents from learning on large-scale datasets such as ImageNet.\n2) The attention / saliency map might be very difficult to compute for complex data if relies an autoencoding-like computation. \n3) There is no guarantee or an intuition on why would the advocates learn to provide evidences that are interpretable to humans. \n\nThe provided experiments are conducted on rather simple datasets and to argue on wide applicability of the method I suggest using more visually-diverse datasets like Cifar. \nI also find the gains on classification accuracy quite marginal and perhaps less important than the interpretability of the evidences which has not been convincingly demonstrated.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
