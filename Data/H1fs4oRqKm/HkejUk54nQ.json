{"title": "Difficult to read; method unclear", "review": "This paper proposes a method for learning to perform monocular depth estimation, using calibrated pairs of stereo images - without supervision from ground truth depth maps. It is heavily based on Godard et al., CVPR 2017, and focuses on sharp ('clear') reconstruction of occluding boundaries.\n\nMy first problem with this paper is the poor quality of English, which makes it difficult to understand. I do not think this submission can be accepted for publication at ICLR, if only because of this.\n\nTechnically speaking, if I understand correctly, the key idea is:  At each optimization step, consider the predicted depth map. The points that are predicted to be visible in only one of the two images according to this depth map are 'disabled' during gradient back propagation, so that they do not influence the network optimization. The motivation is that the loss function assumes that each pixel in the first image is also visible in the corresponding second image of the stereo pairs - which is not true along the occluding boundaries. There is another technique, which (I think) consists in flipping the images and their roles, but I do not understand why it should improve learning - besides providing more training data.\n\nThe proposed method sounds weird to me:  If I understand correctly, there is no guarantee that learning will converge to anything meaningful.  For example, the optimization could introduce more occlusions than there really is, to disable the influence of more pixels without being penalize?\n", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
