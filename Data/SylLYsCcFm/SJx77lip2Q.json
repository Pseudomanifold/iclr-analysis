{"title": "Interesting direction and nice discussions, but evaluation and analysis are not strong enough ", "review": "This work investigates the ability of a neural network to learn analogy. They showed that a simple neural network is able to solve analogy problems with image or abstract input, given that the training data is selected to contrast abstract relational structures. \n\nThe paper is relatively well-written with rich discussions. Some details about the experiments are missing like how many examples are used for training and testing. It is also important to show how much variations are in the dataset, and there should be some external baselines like those proposed in (Barrett et al, 2018). \n\nAlthough the performance is relatively high, some error analysis will provide more insights into what the neural network is missing and if it makes mistakes similar to human. \n\nSection 4 claims that \u201cFor a model trained via LABC, we found that these activities clustered according to relation type (e.g. progression ) more-so than domain\u201d. However, it is unclear whether Figure 4 can support this. Some quantitive measure should help, for example, the average distance within the clusters between clustering based on relation type and domain. \n\nThe novelty of the proposed approach is limited. The difference between the proposed method and baseline in performance seems to be a result of whether there is a difference between train and test setting. For example, if trained in \u201ccontrasting\u201d will have better test performance on \u201ccontrasting\u201d but worse on \u201cnormal\u201d and vice versa. \n\nThe problem is very interesting and the discussion is extensive. However, the proposed approach isn\u2019t very novel and the evaluation and analysis should be improved to provide a stronger support. \n\nBarrett, David GT, et al. \"Measuring abstract reasoning in neural networks.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1807.04225 (2018).\n\n------\n\nScore updated after reading authors' response.
