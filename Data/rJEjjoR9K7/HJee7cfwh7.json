{"title": " The proposal is well structured and written. The quality of the paper is excellent in terms of novelty and originality.", "review": "The paper proposed a novel differentiable neural GLCM network which captures the high reference textural information and discard the lower-frequency semantic information so as to solve the domain generalisation challenge. The author also proposed an approach \u201cHEX\u201d to discard the superficial representations. Two synthetic datasets are created for demonstrating the methods advantages on scenarios where the domain-specific information is correlated with the semantic information. The proposal is well structured and written. The quality of the paper is excellent in terms of novelty and originality. The proposed methods are evaluated thoroughly through experiments with different types of dataset and has shown to achieve good performance.
