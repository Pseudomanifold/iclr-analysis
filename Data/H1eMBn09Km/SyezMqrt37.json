{"title": "An interesting application of GAN", "review": "The paper works on a very interesting problem: generating ride hailing demand map using deep learning technique. The idea is novel and interesting. The paper adopts two metric to evaluate the performance of the algorithm and shows that the performance is good. However, the problem is a little far from real world cases, which limits the contribution of the paper.\n\nThe title of the paper is very attractive. Before reading the paper, I was very excited and wanted to see the algorithm could generate the driving trajectory by using GAN. However, it can only generate the pickup location, which makes me a little disappointed. In real world applications, in riding hailing industry, the demand/supply estimation have been wide investigated. And it can be very accurate. It is not clear why we need to generate it. On the other hand, the paper only adopts conventional GAN to this application. Technically the contribution is not significant. The paper only considers time slot for generating the new data. In this area, much more information has been used. The authors are suggested to survey the smart transportation or riding sharing research area. The training solution is not satisfied. The model is only trained for each small area in the city. The training set is very limited, which may make the model overfit. Thus the experiments and the results are not convincing. In current GIS or transportation area, usually we would use a unique model for the whole city. At least the authors should discuss their algorithm for the scale issue.\n\nOverall, the paper works on a very interesting problem. However, the current solution should be improved.\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
