{"title": "Review", "review": "UPDATE:\nThanks for your response. As you mentioned, methods like [1] and [2] do perform open-ended recombination. Note that these methods perform not only texture transfer but also color transfer, while the proposed method seems to perform mostly only color transfer. As shown in Figure 6, essentially what the method does is transfer the color of the style image to the content image, sometimes with a little tweak, making the image distorted. One could say that in terms of image style transfer, the proposed method actually underperforms [1] and [2]. \n\nHence I agree with R2 that comparison is still necessary for the submission to be more convincing and complete.\n\n------------------------------\n\nThis paper proposed to use a mechanism of leakage filtering to separate styles and content in the VAE encoding, and consequently enable open-ended content-style recombination. Essentially the model tries to maximize the similarity between images in S^+ and minimize the similarity between those in S^-.\n\nI have several questions:\n\nOne concern that I have is the relationship/difference between this work and previous work on style transfer, especially universal/zero-shot style transfer as in [1,2]. In the introduction and related work sections, the authors argue that most previous work assumes that content classes in testing are the same as those in training, and that they are not general purpose. Note that various works on style transfer already address this issue, for example in [1, 2]. For those models, content is represented by high-level feature maps in neural networks, and style is represented by the Gram matrix of the feature maps. The trained model is actually universal (invariant to content and styles). Actually these methods use even less supervision than STOC since they do not require labels (e.g., digit labels in MNIST).\n\nThis brings me to my second concern on proper baselines. Given the fact that previous universal/zero-shot style transfer models focus on similar tasks, it seems necessary to compare STOC to them and see what the advantages of STOC is. Similar experiments can be conducted for the data augmentation tasks.\n\nIn Sec. 4, the authors mentioned that U-Net skip connection is used. Does it affect the effectiveness of the content/style separation, since the LF objective function is mostly based on the encoding z, which is supposed \u2018skipped\u2019 in STOC. Will this lead to additional information leakage?\n\nIt is not clear how the last term of L_{LF} is computed. Could you provide more details?\n\nThe organization and layout of figures could be improved. The title/number for the first section is missing.\n\nMissing references:\n\n[1] Universal style transfer via feature transforms, 2017\n[2] ZM-Net: Real-time zero-shot image manipulation network, 2017\n[3] Structured GAN, 2017", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
