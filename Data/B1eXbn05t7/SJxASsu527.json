{"title": "A novel method for content and style recombination in open domains", "review": "In this paper, the authors study an interesting problem called open-ended content style recombination, i.e., recombining the style of one image with the content of another image. In particular, the authors propose a VAE (variational autoencoder) based method (i.e., Style Transfer onto Open-Ended Content, STOC), which is optimized over a VAE reconstruction loss and/or a leakage filtering (LF) loss. More specifically, there are four variants of STOC, including CC (content classifier), CE (content encoding), PM (predictability minimization, Section 2.1) and LF (leakage filtering, Section 2.2). The main advantage of STOC is its ability to handle novel content from open domains. Experimental results on image synthesis and data set augmentation show the effectiveness of the proposed method in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods. The authors also study the comparative performance of four variants, i.e., CCF, CE, PM and LF.\n\nOverall, the paper is well presented.\n\nSome comments/suggestions:\n\n(i) The authors are suggested to include an analysis of the time complexity of the proposed method (including the four variants).\n\n(ii) The authors are suggested to include more results with different configurations such as that in Table 1 in order to make the results more convincing.\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
