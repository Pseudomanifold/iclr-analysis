{"title": "needs some improvement ", "review": "The aim of this paper is to learn a heuristic for a backtracking search algorithm utilizing Reinforcement learning. The proposed model makes use of Graphical Neural Networks to produce literal and clauses embeddings, and use them to predict the quality of each literal, through a NN, which in turn decides the probability of each action.\n\nPositives\nA new approach on how to employ Machine learning techniques to Automated reasoning problems. Works with any 2QBF solver.\nThe learned heuristic seems to perform better than the state of the art in the presented experiments.\n\nNegatives\nNo theoretical justification about why this heuristic should work better than the existing ones.\nDoesn't solve QBF formulas in general, but only 2QBF.\nIt is not clear whether the range of formulas that can be solved using this approach is greater than that of existing solvers.\nHaving a substantial amount of formulas that produce incomplete episodes, as it might be the case in real world scenarios, hinders learning, so the dataset has to be manually adjusted.\n\nConclusion\nThe proposed framework is an interesting addition to existing techniques in the field and the idea is suitable for further exploration and refinement. The experimental results are promising, so the direction of the work is worth pursuing. However, some of the foundations and overall nature of the work needs some improvement and maturity.
