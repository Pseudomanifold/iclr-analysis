{"title": "Interesting application of reinforcement learning and GNN over a specific decision problem", "review": "The paper is proposing to use reinforcement learning as a method for implementing heuristics of a backtracking search algorithm or Boolean Logic. While I'm not familiar with this specific topic, Section 2 is didactic and clear. The challenges of the tackle problem are clearly explained in this section.\n\nThe Graph neural network architecture proposed in Section 4 to compute literals of the formula is an original idea. The experimental results look convincing and suggest this approach should be more deeply investigated.\n\nMy main concern is that the novelty from a machine learning and reinforcement learning point of view remains limited while the application seems original and promising. So I will not be strongly opposed to the publication if this work in ICLR venue while I remain unsure it is the best one.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
