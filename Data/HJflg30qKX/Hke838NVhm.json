{"title": "Review", "review": "Summary:\nThis paper studies the properties of applying gradient flow and gradient descent to deep linear networks on linearly separable data. For strictly decreasing loss like the logistic loss, this paper shows 1) the loss goes to 0, 2) for every layer the normalized weight matrix converges to a rank-1 matrix 3) these rank-1 matrices are aligned. For the logistic loss, this paper further shows the linear function is the maximum margin solution.\n\nComments:\nThis paper discovers some interesting properties of deep linear networks, namely asymptotic rank-1, and the adjacent matrix alignment effect. These discoveries are very interesting and may be useful to guide future findings for deep non-linear networks. The analysis relies on many previous results in Du et al. 2018, Arora et al. 2018 and Soudry et al. 2017  authors did a good job in combing them and developed some techniques to give very interesting results. \nThere are two weaknesses. First, there is no convergence rate. Second, the step size assumption (Assumption 5) is unnatural. If the step size is set proportional to 1/t or 1/t^2  does this setup satisfies this assumption? \n\nOverall I think there are some interesting findings for deep linear networks and some new analysis presented, so I think this paper is above the bar.\nHowever, I don't think this is a strong theory people due to the two weakness I mentioned.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
