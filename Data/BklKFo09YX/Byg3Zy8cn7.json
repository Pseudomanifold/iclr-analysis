{"title": "An application of CycleGAN to molecule transformations", "review": "Main idea:\nThis paper proposes to use CycleGAN to generate a molecule with a desired property given an initial molecule without that property.  This is a task appearing in drug design. Specifically, the training set consists of two sets of molecules with and without a desired property. For each molecule, a representation/embedding is obtained, which is the latent code of the JT-VAE. Two generators/transformers are introduced to perform transformation from the representation of one domain to that of another domain. The training involves a weighted sum of several losses: the LSGAN loss, the cyclic consistency loss and the reconstruction loss, which are exactly the same losses used in the CycleGAN paper.  Experiments are conducted on ZINC-250K dataset and evaluated in terms of structural modifications and molecule optimization.\n\nComments:\nThis is a good application paper using machine learning techniques. However, I don't think ICLR is a suitable venue for this paper since the improvements and contributions are more on molecule optimization side. I suggest that the authors extend the technical part of CycleGAN with more background introduction and submit the paper to a bioinformatics journal.
