{"title": "Winograd-aware pruning of convolutions", "review": "The paper proposes a technique (well, two) to prune convolutional layers to reduce the required amount of computation when  the convolutions are done using the winograd algorithm. Winograd convolutions first transform the image and the filter, apply a multiplication in the transformed space, and then retransform the image back to the intended image space. The transformation of the filter, however, means that sparsity in the regular domain does not translate to sparsity in the winograd domain.\n\nThis paper presents two techniques to achieve sparsity in the winograd domain: approximating winograd sparsity based on sparsity in the regular domain (thereby pruning with a non uniform cost model) and pruning in winograd space directly. The actual implementation alternates the first pruning technique and retraining the network with fixed sparsity followed by alternating winograd-space pruning and retraining. The tricky part is retraining in winograd space, which seems to require fine tuned per coordinate learning rates.\n\nMy main concern is that the method feels fairly fragile and hyperparameter-heavy: tuning all the learning rates and sparsity rates for all these iterated levels of pruning doesn't seem easy. Similarly, it's unclear why the first stage of pruning is even needed if it's possible to prune and fine tune in winograd space directly. It's unclear from reading the paper how, given a computational budget, to decide the time spent in each phase of the process.\n\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
