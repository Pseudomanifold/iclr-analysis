{"title": "A very interesting approach to constraint policy optimization that uses nonparametric relaxation with subsequent projection", "review": "The paper proposes to perform a constraint optimization of an approximation of the expected reward function for unparameterized policy with subsequent projection of the solution to the nearest parameterized one. This approach allows fast (\"nearly closed form\") solutions for nonparametric policies and leads to an increase in sample efficiency.\n\nThe proposed approach is interesting and the results are promising.\n", "rating": "9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}
