{"title": "Interesting paper with sufficient empirical experiments", "review": "The paper aims to remove potential examples with label noise by discarding the ones with large losses in the training procedure. The idea also applies to the setting where instances may contain large noise. The proposed method may have an implicit trade-off between the robust to label noise and feature noise, which explains why the proposed method also has good performances on instance-dependent label noise. The paper is well-written and has sufficient experiments. \n\nThe discussions in Section 2.2 is unclear for me. What is \"p_n(\\ell)\"? What is \"p-th percentile of a distribution\"? How reasonable thresholds are derived for the uniform label noise? Why the method will generalize to other types of label noise?\n\n===\nAfter reading the rebuttal, it is still unclear of how to determine the thresholds for finding incorrect labels. The authors empirically demonstrated a procedure to statistically find a threshold under the assumption that the label noise is uniform. However, theoretical guarantees are lacking. The extension to other types of label noise is also very intuitive. Although the proposed method is simple and effective, the lack of an effective method for choosing the threshold is a major concern for real-world applications. Are there some other ways to determine the threshold? For example, cross-validation method?", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
