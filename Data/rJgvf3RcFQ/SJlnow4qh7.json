{"title": "Good summary and experimental evaluation of various inducive biases in deep reinforcement learning", "review": "The paper presents and evaluates different common inductive biases in Deep RL. These are systematically evaluated on different experimental settings.\n\nThe paper is easy to read and the authors explain well the setting and their findings. The comparison and evaluations is well conducted and valuable contribution to the literature.  I would have liked some more details on the motivating example in section 3.1, maybe with a figure supporting the explanation of the example.
