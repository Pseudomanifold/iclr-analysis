{"title": "Learning Programmatically Structured Representations with Perceptor Gradients ", "review": "This paper proposes the perceptor gradients algorithm to learn symbolic representations for devising autonomous agent policies to act.\nThe perceptor gradients algorithm decomposes a typical policy into a perceptor network that maps observations to symbolic representations and a user-provided task encoding program which is executed on the perceived symbols in order to generate an action. Experiments show the proposed approach achieves faster learning rates compared to methods based solely on neural networks and yields transferable task related symbolic representations. The results prove the programmatic regularisation is a general technique for structured representation learning. Although the reviewer is out of the area in this paper, this paper seems to propose a novel algorithm to learn the symbolic representations.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess"}
