{"title": "Interesting, but not clear enough.", "review": "The paper proposes the factorized action variational autoencoder (FAVAE) as a new model for learning disentangled representations in high-dimensional sequences, such as videos. In contrast to earlier work that encouraged disentanglement through a carefully-designed dynamical prior, the authors propose a different encoder-decoder architecture combined with a modified loss function (Beta-VAE with a \u201cshift C scheme\u201d). As a result, the authors claim that their approach leads to useful disentangled representation learning in toy video data, and in data taken from a robotic task.\n\nThe paper appears to combine multiple ideas, which are not cleanly studied in isolation from each other. Several claims may be a bit oversold, such as potential applications for stock price data. But more importantly, the reasons why I don\u2019t recommend accepting the paper are the following ones:\n\nLack of clarity:\nI found that the paper lacks clarity in its presentation. Equation 7 presents a model that seems to have only a latent variable z without time dependence, but how can dynamic and static factors be separately controlled? I don't see this question addressed in the experiments. Also, what is the significance of the model architecture (ladder network) as compared to the modified loss function?  Furthermore, Fig. 7 is hard to read.\n\nLack of Experiments:\nThe currently presented experiments are all on rather simple data. I recommend extending the experiments to the Sprites data set, used in (Li and Mandt 2018), or to speech data. Also, the paper lacks comparisons to the recently proposed disentangled representation learning models (FHVAE and Disentangled Sequential Autoencoder).\n\nWhile it is apparent that the model achieved some clustering, it is unclear to me if the final goal of separately controlling for static and dynamic aspects was really reached.\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
