{"title": "Solid work", "review": "The authors suggest and analyse two types of preconditioners for optimization, a Newton type and a Fisher type preconditioner.\n\nThe paper is well written, the analysis is clear and the significance is arguably given. The authors run their optimizers on a synthetic benchmark data set and on imagenet.\nThe originality is not so high as the this line of research exists for long. \nThe \"Lie\" in the title is (technically correct, but) a bit misleading, as only matrix groups were used.\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
