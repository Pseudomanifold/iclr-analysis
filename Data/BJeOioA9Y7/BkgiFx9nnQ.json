{"title": "Multiple task learning for NNs", "review": "This paper proposes a new set of heuristics for learning a NN for generalising a set of NNs trained for more specific tasks. This particular recipe might be reasonable, but the semi-formal flavour is distracting. The issue of model selection (clearly the main issue here) is not addressed. A quite severe issue with this report is that the authors don't report relevant learning results from before (+-) 2009, and empirical comparisons are only given w.r.t. other recent heuristics. This makes it for me not possible to advice publication as is.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
