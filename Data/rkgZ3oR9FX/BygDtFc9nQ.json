{"title": "an interesting and creative paper", "review": "The paper investigates how chairs are being described \"in the context of other similar or not-so-similar chairs\", by humans and neural networks. Humans perceive an object's structure, and use it to describe the differences to other objects \"in context\". The authors collected a corresponding \"chairs in context\" corpus, and build models that can describe the \"target\" chair, that can be used to retrieve the described object, and that can create more discriminative language if given information about the listener.\n\nThe paper is well written, in particular the appendix is very informative. The work seems novel in combination with the dataset, and an interesting and well executed study with interesting analysis that is very relevant to both situated natural language understanding and language generation. The \"3D\" aspect is a bit weak, given that all chairs seem to have essentially been pictured in very similar positions.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
