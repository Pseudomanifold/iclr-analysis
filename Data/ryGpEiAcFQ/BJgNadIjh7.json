{"title": "This paper is not presented with sufficient clarity for ICLR publication", "review": "The authors present a biologically-inspired neural network model based on the excitatory and inhibitory ion channels in the membranes of real cells.  Unfortunately, the paper is structured incoherently, making it nearly impossible to appreciate the authors' contribution.  The introduction references neuroscience alongside ResNets, FinTech, surprisal spaces, Bose-Einstein statistics, and topological conjugacy without adequately motivating or defining any of the above.  The fundamental definition of the model synapse as a conditional probability (Eq. 1) is not guaranteed to be non-negative, casting serious doubt on any of the subsequent conclusions.   Figure 1 conveys no further information about the proposed model.  There is no explicit related work or background section.  The single experiment offers no comparison to alternative methods.   I suggest the authors invest serious effort into rewriting the paper to clarify the presentation and explicitly state their contributions in the context of existing work on biologically-inspired learning models.  This is indeed a subfield of machine learning worthy of more investigation. ", "rating": "2: Strong rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
