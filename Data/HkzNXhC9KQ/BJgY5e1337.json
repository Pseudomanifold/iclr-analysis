{"title": "Overall score 7", "review": "1. An ASPA coding method was proposed in this paper for lossy compression, which achieves the state-of-the-art performance on Kodak dataset and RAISE-1k dataset.\n\n2. What is the difference on the architecture used in the proposed method and other compared methods? Since various numbers of layers or neurons lead to very big differences on the resulting performance.\n\n3. Besides, it seems that the proposed method for compressing images includes more complex calculations. Is it faster or slower than others?\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
