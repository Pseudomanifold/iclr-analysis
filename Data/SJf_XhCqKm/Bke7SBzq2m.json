{"title": "interesting and clear idea on using DPPs for hyperparameter search", "review": "- This paper proposes an approach to get samples with high dispersion for hyperparameter optimisation. \n- It theoretically motivates the use of Determinantal Point Processes in yielding such samples.\n- Further, an iterative mixing algorithm is proposed to handle continuous and discrete sample space.\n- Experiments on finding hyperparameter for sentence classification are presented. In terms of accuracy, it performs better than other open-loop methods. In comparison to closed-loop methods, it yields parameter settings with comparable performance but with gains in wall clock time.\n- The distinction from close-loop approaches makes it easy to parallelise.\n\n\nThis paper is novel in its modelling of hyperparameter optimisation with DPP and the theoretical justification and experiments have been clearly presented. It would be interesting to explore the practicability of the method on more large-scale experiments on image related tasks.\n\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
