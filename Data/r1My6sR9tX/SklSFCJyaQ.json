{"title": "Interesting approach but still not finished", "review": "The paper proposes to employ metalearning techniques for unsupervised tasks. The authors construct tasks in an automatic way from unlabeled data and run meta-learning over the constructed tasks.\n\nAlthough the paper presents a novel approach and the experiments included in the work show promising results, in my opinion, the paper is still not mature. There are some importants problems:\n* The motivation of the paper is weak. The authors include the problem statement as well as the definitions used in the paper without knowing what is the goal of the proposed algorithm. A clear example of a real problem where the proposed framework could be applied is necessary to motivate the work.\n* The paper is difficult to read and follow. The paper is composed by a set of parts without many links. This makes difficult to read the paper to not very experienced readers. A running example could be useful to increase the readability of the work. In my opinion, the paper contains too much material for the length of the conference. In fact, some important information has been moved to the appendices. \n*Experimental section is specially hard to follow. The authors want to solve too many questions in a short space. Comparisons with other related papers should be included. \n\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
