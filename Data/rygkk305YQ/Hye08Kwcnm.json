{"title": "Hierarchical Generative Modeling for Controllable Speech Synthesis", "review": "Quality: This submission claims to present a model that can control non-annotated attributes such as speaking style, accent, background noise, etc. Though empirical evidence in the form of numerical measurements is presented for some controllable attributes more evidence other than individual samples and authors claims is needed. For example a reliable numerical evidence is needed on page 4 following \"We also found...\", page 5 following \"We discovered....\", page 5 following \"It clearly presents...\", page 5 following \"Drawing samples...\" evidence is given only for 1 dimension, page 6 following \"Figure 7(b)...\". \n\nClarity: The model is simple though the exact form and nature of observed and latent class variables could be made more explicit. Including how they are computed/initialised/set. What are different modes using the proposed model? Why both negative results are in the appendix? \n\nOriginality: moderately\n\nSignificance: moderately\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
