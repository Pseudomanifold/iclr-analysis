{"title": "Nice idea but not very novel, extensive evaluation setup with positive resutls, unawareness of some important previos work", "review": "This paper describes a model for cross lingual transfer with no target language information. This is a well written paper that makes a number of contributions:\n\n1. It provides an interesting discussion of transfer form multiple source languages into a target language. This is a timely problem and the paper points out that adversarial networks may be too limiting in this setup.\n\n2. It provides a modeling approach that deals with the limitations of adversarial networks as mentioned in (1).\n\n3. It demonstrates the value of the proposed approach through an extensive experimental setup.\n\nAt the same time, I see two major limitations to the paper:\n\n1. While the proposed approach is valid, it is not very original, at least in my subjective eyes. The authors integrate a classifier that combines the private, language-specific features so that not only features that are shared between all the involved languages can be used in the classification process. While this is a reasonable idea that works well in practice, IMO it is quite straight forward and builds on ideas that have been recently been proposed in many other works.\n\n2. The authors claim that: \"To our best knowledge, this work is the first to propose\nan unsupervised CLTL framework without depending on any cross-lingual resource\"\n\nThis is, unfortunately, not true. I refer the authors to the paper:\n\nDeep Pivot-Based Modeling for Cross-language Cross-domain Transfer with Minimal Guidance. Yftah Ziser and Roi Reichart. EMNLP 2018.\n\nIn their lazy setup, the EMNLP authors do exactly that. They address the more complicated cross-language, cross-domain setup, but their model can be easily employed within a single domain. Their experiments even use the multilingual sentiment dataset used in the current paper. The model in the EMNLP paper shows to outperform adversarial networks, so it can be competitive here as well.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
