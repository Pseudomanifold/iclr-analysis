{"title": "Limited significance ", "review": "This paper proposed to tackle a large-scale fine-grained object classification problem by approximated CRF. The main motivation is to exploit the spatial conference of object labels to reduce noises in the instance-wise prediction. To this end, the task is formulated by sequential inference problem using CRF. To speed up training, several techniques are applied such as factorized pairwise-potential and approximation of CRF objective.  \n\nAlthough the paper presented a reasonable idea for their particular problem (i.e. classification of products in the store display), the significance of the work is quite limited as the same idea is not generally applicable to other settings (e.g. there is no strong spatial correlation of labels in general images). Also, the performance improvement over the instance object classification is not significant as shown in Figure 5 (Unary vs. Approximate factorized). Due to the limited significance and impact of the work, this reviewer suggests a rejection of this paper. \n", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
