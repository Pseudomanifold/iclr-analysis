{"title": "The paper proposes a new way to utilize the discriminator in adversarial learning. The method seems reasonable and effective, but the paper writing needs significant improvement.", "review": "Pros:\n1) The paper utilizes the concept of adversarial learning for eliminating unwanted information from the original input and treats domain adaptation and noise removal as two cases. Such a viewpoint is appreciated.\n\n2) A new way of utilizing the discriminator S to update the encoder---by forcing the features to be orthogonal to the classifier weights---is proposed. The method seems more stable.\n\nCons:\n1) The paper needs significant rewriting. First of all, the motivations are not clear. The introduction simply ignores the problem to be resolved. The abstract (as well as Section 2) looks like a plain description of the technical details instead of highlighting the motivations and contributions. The related work should include discussions on both noisy removal and domain adaptation.\n\n2) The main difference between the proposed method to existing adversarial learning methods is in how to use the information form the discriminator S. To give a more meaningful comparison, I would suggest the authors having a section detailedly comparing the math formulations to support the claim. I would also suggest the authors looking into other models/problems where adversarial learning is being used and see if the proposed idea can be applied---this will make the proposed method widely applicable and have more impact. \n\n3) Section 4 needs improvement.\n3-1) From Fig 3, it seems all the compared methods already perform pretty good. Data from each speaker are already clustered very well.\n3-2) It would be great to have tables summarizing the essential statistics of datasets being used.\n3-3) For Table 2, more compared baselines are needed.\n\nOther comments:\n1) The authors mentioned that Yu's 2017 method is not applicable to the experiments. Then how do they still implement it in Table 1?\n ", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
