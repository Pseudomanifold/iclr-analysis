{"title": "Preliminary but interesting idea which requires more work before it can be published", "review": "The authors propose a method to learn \"useful\" latent representations in an unsupervised manner. Their model is different from the previously proposed models of either using an autoencoder architecture or using adversarial training. Instead, in the proposed model, the discriminator plays a cooperative game with an encoder to make it learn a representation which is meaningful. The entire model is trained end-to-end and the authors show some preliminary results on two fairly small scale datasets. \n\nWhile the proposed approach is quite interesting, there are a number of issues I have with the presented manuscript.\n\n- The work presented is quite preliminary and I feel requires more polishing and results before one can deem it suitable for publication. \n- Given that the latent representation of the current input has to be measured against the representations of all the other inputs in the datasets, makes the approach not scalable to large datasets (having millions or more examples). \n- Why did the authors choose to embed the inputs in only two dimensional space? \n- The experimental results are rather weak: tested on only a couple of small scale datasets with very little quantitative experiments. \n- While the authors show clusters in the latent space, there is no verification on how useful these representations might be for the end goal. \n\nGiven the various issues I feel that the paper is not ready for publication. The approach is definitely interesting and I hope the authors can work more to further validate the efficacy of the model and submit again when ready.
