{"title": "review on \"DEFactor: Differentiable Edge Factorization-based Probabilistic Graph Generation\"", "review": "This paper proposed a variant of the graph variational autoencoder [1] to do generative modeling of graphs. The author introduced an additional conditional variable (e.g., property value) into the decoder. By backpropagating through the discriminator, the model is able to find the graph with desired property value. \n\nOverall the paper reads well and is easy to follow. The conditional generation of graphs seems also helpful regarding the empirical performance. However, there are several concerns regarding the paper:\n\n1) The edge factorization-based modeling is not new. In fact [1] already uses the node embeddings to factorize the adjacency matrix. This paper models extra information including node tags and edge types, but these are not fundamental differences compared to [1].\n\n2) The paper claims the method is \u2018cheaper\u2019 and \u2018scalable\u2019. Since essentially the computation cost is similar to [1] which requires at least O(n^2) to generate a graph with n nodes, I\u2019m not super confident about the author\u2019s claim. Though this can be parallelized, but the memory cost is still in this order of magnitude, which might be too much for a sparse graph. Also there\u2019s no large graph generative modeling experiments available.\n\n3) Continue with 2), the adjacency matrix of a large graph (e.g., graph with more than 1k nodes) doesn\u2019t have to be low rank. So modeling with factorization (with typically ~256 embedding size) may not be suitable in this case. \n\nSome minor comments:\n4) Regarding Eq (2), why the lstm is used, instead of some simple order invariant aggregation?\n\n5) the paper needs more refinement. E.g., in the middle of page 2 there is a missing citation. \n\n[1]  Kipf & Welling, Variational Graph Auto-Encoders, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.07308.pdf\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
