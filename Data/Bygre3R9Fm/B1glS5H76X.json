{"title": "The paper is very poor--- not ready for publication", "review": "The paper proposes a conditional graph generation that directly optimizes the properties of the graph. The paper is very weak.\n1. I think almost all probabilistic graph generative models are differentiable. If the  objective is differentiable function of real   \n    variables, it is usually differentiable.\n\n2.  The authors claim that existing works Simonovsky and Komodakis (2018) and Cao & Kipf (2018) are restricted to use small graphs with predefined maximum size. This work does not overcome the limitation of small graphs issue too.\n\n3. The authors do not show any measure on validity, novelty or uniqueness which are now standard in literature.\n   Also I do not find any comparison with molGAN paper which tackles a similar objective.\n\n4. Could the authors show if the decoding process is permutation invariant? I am not really sure of that. I was trying to prove that thing formally, but I failed.\n\n\n ", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
