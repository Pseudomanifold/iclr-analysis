{"title": "I don't understand why the proposed method is an asynchronous method", "review": "This paper tries to propose a so-called hybrid algorithm to eliminate the gradient delay of asynchronous methods. The authors propose algorithm 1 and a simplified version algorithm 2 and prove the convergence of algorithm 2 in the paper.  The paper is very hard to follow, especially the algorithm description part. What I can understand is that the authors want to let the fast workers do more local updates until the computation in the slowest worker is done. The idea is similar to EASGD except that it forces the workers to communicate the server once the slowest one has completed their job.\n\nThe following are my concerns:\n1. Do you consider the overhead in constructing the communication between machines? in your method,  workers are keeping notifying servers that they are done with the computation. \n2. In Algorithm 1 line 9 and line 23, there are two assignments: x_init =x and x_init=ps.x, is there any conflict? \n3. In Algorithm 2,  at line 6 workers wait to receive ps.x, at line 20 server wait for updates. I think there is a bug, and nothing can be received at both ends.\n4. The experiments are too weak. There is no comparison between other related methods, such as downpour, easgd.\n5. The authors test resnet50 on cifar10,  however, there is no accuracy result. They show the result by using googlenet, why not resnet50? I am curious about the experimental settings.\n\nAbove all, the paper is hard to follow and the idea is very trivial. Experiments in the paper are also very weak.
