{"title": "Interesting paper", "review": "This is an interesting paper with a new approach to learn a sparse, positive (and hence interpretable) semantic space that maximizes human similarity judgements, by training to specifically maximize the prediction of human similarity judgements. The authors have collected the dataset themselves and have rating of sets of 3 objects from 1854 unique objects. They end up with a space (SPoSE) with relatively low dimensionality with respect to usual word embeddings (49 dimension) but perhaps not surprising when considering the small size of the words to embed. The authors run a set of experiment to show the usefulness of SPoSE. The most interesting one is the prediction of its dimensions by the CSLB features, which reveals a nice clustering in the different SPoSE dimensions. Perhaps the results would be a little more convincing if additional common word embeddings were also tested.\n\nDue to the different objects used in the different datasets, some of the experiments have a smaller set of words. A good extension of this work would be to combine a text-derived embedding  or the synsets to interpolate the SPoSE dimensions for missing words in the original set. Or perhaps the object similarity ratings could be used in a semi-supervised setting to inform the learning of a co-occurence word embedding. This will allow the model to better describe a larger set of words. Another possible extension is to test this larger set of words on a non-behavioral NLP task to show possible improvements that the behavioral data and the interpretable space give.\n\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
