{"title": "Unsupervised Learning of the Set of Local Maxima", "review": "In this paper, the authors focus on the task of learning the value function and the constraints in unsupervised case. Different from the conventional classification-based approach, the proposed algorithm uses local maxima as an indicator function. The functions c and h and two corresponding generators are trained in an adversarial way. Besides, the authors analyzed that the proposed algorithm is more efficient than the conventional classification-based approach, and a suitable generalization bound is given. Overall, this work is theoretically complete and experimentally sufficient.\n1.\tThe trained c and h give different predictions in most cases. As a unsupervised method, how to deal with them?\n2.\tIn Table3, why can h achieve better results when adding noise?\n", "rating": "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
