{"title": "a refined approach for robust verification, but experimental part could be stronger", "review": "This paper introduces a verifier that obtains improvement on both the precision of the incomplete verifiers and the scalability of the complete verifiers. The proposed approaches combines over-parameterization, mixed integer linear programming, and linear programming relaxation. \n\nThis paper is well written and well organized. I like the simple example exposed in section 2, which is a friendly start. However, I begun to lose track after that. As far as I can understand, the next section listed several techniques to be deployed. But I failed to see enough justification or reasoning why these techniques are important. My background is more theoretical, but I'm looking for theorems here, considering the complicatedness of neural network. All I am looking for is probably some high level explanation.\n\nEmpirically, the proposed approach is more robust while time consuming that the AI2 algorithm. However, the contribution and the importance of this paper still seems incremental to me.  I probably have grumbled too much about the lack of reasonings. As this paper is purely empirical, which is totally fine and could be valuable and influential as well.  In that case, I found the current experiment unsatisfying and would love to see more extensive experimental results. \n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
