{"title": "use prior distribution to constrain network embedding. novelty may not be high enough", "review": "The paper proposed to use a prior distribution to constraint the network embedding. The paper used very restricted Gaussian distributions for the formulation. The proposed approach should compared to other stronger methods such as graph convolution neural network/message passing neural networks/structure2vec. ", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
