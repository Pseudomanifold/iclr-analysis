{"title": "Interesting idea, but some parts of the paper are not clear", "review": "This paper studied learning unsupervised node embeddings by considering the structural properties of networks. Experimental results on a few data sets prove the effective of the proposed approaches over existing state-of-the-art approaches for unsupervised node embeddings. \n\nStrength:\n- important problem and interesting idea\n- the proposed approach seems to be effective according to the experiments\nWeakness:\n- some parts of the paper are quite unclear\n- the complexity of the proposed algorithm seems to be very high\n- the data sets used in the experiments are very small\n\nDetails:\n-In the introduction, \"it is in general impossible to find an embedding in R^d such that ...\", why do we have to make v and v'(and u, and u') far from each other?\n- In Equation (2), How is P_ij defined exactly, are they parameters? I am quite confused about this part\n- In Equation (6), the posterior distribution should be P(X|G) since X is the latent variable to be inferred, right\uff1f\n- In Table 2 and 3, how are the degree and block information leveraged into the model?\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
