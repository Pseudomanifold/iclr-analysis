{"title": "FEATURE ATTRIBUTION AS FEATURE SELECTION", "review": "The authors formalize the feature attribution problem as a feature selection problem and they demonstrate that several existing feature attribution methods can be interpreted as approximation algorithms for Exclusive Feature Selection and Inclusive Feature Selection.\n\n- The authors claim that IFS is better suited as the formalization for the feature attribution problem and EFS has several unfavourable properties. Although they did exhaustive experiments to show this, it is not clear to the reviewer. \n\n- Also, it is more interesting if the authors can show how we use IFS in real applications.\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}
