{"title": "The paper can be much improved by providing more evidence of the robustness to adversarial attack and advantages over other models.", "review": "The paper is working on a robust classifier that consists of two stages. The first stage performs unsupervised conditional kernel density estimates (KDE) of the covariate vectors, and the second stage is feature extractions and classification. I appreciate the authors' efforts to clarify the intuition, but more technical details and experiments can be provided to support their arguments. My questions and comments are below.\n\n1. Page 2. \"this means the stochastic gradient descent training algorithm minimizing...\" Is the problem because of SGD or the structure of NN? I think the reason might be the latter, consider logistic regression, which can be seen as a single-layer NN, does not suffer such a problem. \n2. I know the KDE part is from an existing paper, but more technical details can make the paper clearer and some statements are questionable. Specifically, what basis vectors are used for (3)? Is it really speedy and scalable (Page 4, Section 3.1) for BNP-MFA if using Gibbs sampling? Is it the reason why the experiments in Table 1 is incomplete?\n3. For Eqn (7), how do you calculate \\beta's to \"scale the correct class label higher than incorrect classes for the cases...?\"\n4. Is the proposed model robust to all kinds of attacks, like gradient based noise, and outliers which locates far away from the corresponding cluster?\n5. Can you provide some experiments to show the advantage over other approaches?[1]\n\n\nI highly encourage the use of BNP KDE which has many advantages as stated in the paper. But the authors may have to solve the problem of scalability and show advantages over other approaches.\n\n[1]Uli\u010dn\u00fd, Matej, Jens Lundstr\u00f6m, and Stefan Byttner. \"Robustness of deep convolutional neural networks for image recognition.\" International Symposium on Intelligent Computing Systems.
