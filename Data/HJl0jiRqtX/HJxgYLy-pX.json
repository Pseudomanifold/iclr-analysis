{"title": "Interesting but difficult to read", "review": "----I acknowledge that the authors have made improvements to the paper and have increased my score to 6\n\nThis is still definitely not my area of expertise and so I am leaving my confidence score low. \n---\n\nThe paper presents an algorithm EDDI that uses a a partial VAE and does active feature selection. The authors show quite a bit of experiments that seem to indicate the approach gives positive results.  However, since this is not my main area of expertise I do not know if these tasks are standard evaluation for this task.\n\nFor instance in Section 4.3, 4.4 why don't the authors plot accuracy as a function of steps/number of variables observed. That would seem much more useful than log likelihood.\n\nIn general, I found the methodology in the paper to be difficult to understand and not enough background was given.\nI think the paper would be clearer if it was more self contained.\n\n-For instance, I found much of Section 3 to not have enough background. The authors use lots of terminology around VAEs but don't give enough rigorous background so the paper doesn't feel self contained. \n\n-The same is true regarding \"amortized inference\" which I also feel isn't rigorously defined anywhere but often discussed. \n\n-The task for Section 4.1 (image inpainting) is not quite defined.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}
