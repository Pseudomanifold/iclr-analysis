{"title": "Potentially interesting but unfinished work", "review": "The paper proposes a new \"sorting\" layer in neural networks that offers\nsome theoretical properties to be able to learn network which are 1-Lipschitz\nfunctions.\n\nThe paper contains what seems to be a nice contribution but the manuscript\nseems to have been written in a rush which makes it full of typos\nand very hard to read. This unfortunately really feels like unfinished work.\n\nJust to name a few:\n\n- Please check the use of \\citep and \\citet. See eg Szegedy ref on page 3.\n\n- Unfinished sentence \"In this work ...\" page 3.\n\n- \"]\" somewhere at the bottom of page 4.\n\n- \"Hence, neural network has cannot to lose Jacobian norm... \" ???\n\netc...\n\nAlthough I would like to offer here a comprehensive review I consider\nthat the authors have not done their job with this submission.
