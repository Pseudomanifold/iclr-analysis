{"title": "well-written paper", "review": "The paper is well written and presented, giving a good literature review and clearly explaining the design decisions and trade-offs. The paper proposes a novel factorisation approach and uses recurrent networks. \n\nThe evaluation is both quantitative and qualitative. The qualitative experiment is interesting, but there is no information given about the level of musical training the participants had. You would expect very different results from music students compared to the general public. How did you control for musical ability/ understanding?\n\nThe paper has a refreshing honesty in its critical evaluation of the results, highlighting fundamental problems in this field.\n\nOverall, while I am not an expert in musical composition and machine learning, the paper is clear, and appears to be advancing the art in a reliable fashion.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
