{"title": "Review for Stable Opponent Shaping in Differentiable Games ", "review": "This paper studies differential games, in which there are n players and each has a loss function. The loss function depends on all parameters. Differential games appear naturally in GANs, where the two players are the generator and the discriminator. The authors first argue why Nash equilibria should not be the right solution concept for multi-agent learning and propose \u201cstable fixed points\u201d (SFP) as a possible solution concept. The authors then show the LOLA algorithm (Foerster et al. (2018)) fails to preserve fixed points by explicitly constructing an instance (the tandem game). In fact in the tandem game, LOLA will converge to sub-optimal scenarios with worse losses for both agents. The authors then show that an known algorithm LookAhead (Zhang & Lesser (2010)) has local convergence to SPF. However, LookAhead does not have the capacity to exploit opponent dynamics and encourage cooperation. To alleviate this issue, the authors propose a new algorithm SOS, which can be seen as an interpolation between LOLA and LookAhead, characterized by a parameter p. The authors also discuss how to choose the parameter p and prove that SOS will have local convergence to SFP and can avoid strict saddles.  \n\nOverall, this paper is well-written and develops algorithms for a well-motivated problem. Although I am not an expert on this topic, the paper seems interesting to me. \n\nMinor Comment:\nFirst paragraph in Section 2.2, \"It is highly undesirable to converge to Nash in this game\" -> Nash equilibria \n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}
