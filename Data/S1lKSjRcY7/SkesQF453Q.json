{"title": "The paper proposed to reduce the computation of the Re-parameterization and Marginalization method and the bias of Continuous Relaxation estimator.", "review": "The paper proposed a modification to RAM that allows us to trade decreased computational cost for increased variance. It also proposes an improved continuous relaxation (ICR) estimator to reduce the bias of CR, which is extended to categorical variables.\nThe proposed piece-wise linear relaxation (PWL) can be considered as the inverse CDF of the random variable is very interesting. The ICR estimators can also be extended to categorical variables. \nThe paper is well written. I have some questions:\n1.\tHow does the dimension of the variables affect the bias and variance of the proposed estimator?\n2.\tDose the proposed estimators applicable to hierarchical models with multi-discrete latent variables?\n3.\t What\u2019s the performance of the proposed method compared with the others in terms of running time?\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
