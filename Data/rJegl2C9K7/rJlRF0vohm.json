{"title": "Good but contribution is limited", "review": "Summary:\nThe paper proposed to divide a network into multiple parts and distill each part sequentially. The purpose is to improve the distillation performance when the teacher network is deep.\n\nQuality:\n- I think the multi-stage idea makes sense and I agree it can improve the accuracy. But the improvement seems to be very limited. More experiments would be necessary to justify its value.\n- Also, the stage-by-stage approach might also produce more overhead in computation. More analysis is needed for the computation.\n\nClarity:\n- The paper is a bit hard to follow especially in the \"observations\" part, even though eventually I managed to get the core idea of the paper.\n\nOriginality:\n- The contribution is incremental.\n- I feel the multi-stage idea has been used extensively.\n\nSignificance:\nI believe the paper could be improved significantly in order to produce desired impact.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
