{"title": "Review", "review": "1) Summary\nThis paper proposes a hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) method for visual motor control of humanoid agents. The method is decomposed into a high-level controller that takes in visual input and proprioceptive information, and a low-level controller (they compare may ways of doing this) that takes care of the agent\u2019s motor control. In experiments, the proposed method is tested on a variety of RL tasks where the many low-level controllers presented in the paper are compared against each other.\n\n2) Pros:\n+ Novel high-level controller that takes in front-view visual information\n+ Novel multi-policy low level controller\n+ Interesting experimental section\n\n3) Cons:\nNumerical comparison to previous methods:\n- The only issue I found with this paper is that there is no comparison with other methods. Even if the other methods do not take in front-view visual input, it would be nice to compare with them. Maybe visual inputs results in better high-level controller? Or even show that performance is similar would be an interesting result.\n\n4) Comments:\nJerky transitions in switching controller:\n- Due to the fact that one policy takes over after each other based on the high-level controller choice, there is a jerk artifact that shows when the policies are being changed/executed. Did you guys try to add a connection in feature space between policies rather than only passing the state of the agent? This may be able to help with that artifact that sampling noise adds to the actions. Can the authors comment on this?\n\nSteerable controller limited rotation:\n- From observing the steerable controller policy in action, it seems the policy learned a steering that is somewhat independent of what the limbs are doing. Maybe adding a mechanism where the leg motion intensity depends more on the direction of movement could be a way to fix the issue where this policy moves to fast for the turning it tries to do. Maybe an energy based objective to minimize the torques or something in that line.\n\n4) Conclusion:\nTo the best of my knowledge, this paper proposes a novel interesting method for modeling humanoid motor skills with front-view visual input. However, as mentioned above, the paper lacks of numerical comparisons with other methods, and only compares against its own variations which is more of an ablation study. I am willing to increase my review score if the authors successfully address the concerns mentioned above", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
