{"title": "i liked this paper last time i reviewed it, and i like it still :)", "review": "last time i had two comments:\n1. the real data motifs did not look like what i'd expect motifs to look like. now that the authors have thresholded the real data motifs, they do look as i'd expect.\n2. i'm not a fan of VAE, and believe that simpler optimization algorithms might be profitable.  i acknowledge that SCC requires additional steps; i am not comparing to SCC. rather, i'm saying given your generative model, there are many strategies one could employ to estimate the motifs.  i realize that VAE is all the rage, and is probably fine.  in my own experiments, simpler methods often work as well or better for these types of problems.  i therefore believe this would be an interesting avenue to explore in future work.", "rating": "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
