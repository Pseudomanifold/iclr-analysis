{"title": "Interesting ideas applied in the neural domain", "review": "Thank you for a pleasurable and informative read, I consider the writing and structure of the paper to be coherent and well written. \n\nGiven an end-to-end learning of neural motifs, a great deal of time can be avoided, reducing the several intermediary steps required to detect motifs from calcium imaging. This paper may very well improve researchers efficiency, in particular when working with calcium imaging. The question remain to what extent these ideas may be useful in other imaging modalities, i.e. fMRI.\n\nMy main critique would be to be more explicit about why the VAE you propose, is superior to other models in the generative modelling domain.", "rating": "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
