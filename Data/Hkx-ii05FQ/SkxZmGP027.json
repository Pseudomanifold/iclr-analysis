{"title": "Interesting paper with similar prior work and unconvincing experimental evaluation", "review": "The paper proposes an approach to construct surrogate objectives for the effective application of policy gradient methods to combinatorial optimization without known neighborhood structure. The surrogate is constructed with the goal of reducing the need of hyper-parameter tuning and evaluated on a clique finding task.\n\nThe proposed approach is very similar to the CE method by Rubinstein (as stated by the authors in the related work section), limiting the contributions of this paper. The proposed sampling distributions assumes independence between the random variables over which the authors optimize \u2014 I find it surprising that this leads to good empirical results are relatively little structure can be captured using this distribution. Can the authors elaborate on this? However, as also observed by the authors, the sampling distribution can also be replaced by more sophisticated distributions. The empirical evaluation is limited in considering only one task (clique finding), and the results seem to be quite sensitive to the chosen optimizer.
