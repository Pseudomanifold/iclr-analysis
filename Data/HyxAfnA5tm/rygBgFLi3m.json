{"title": "This was a nice proposal of a nonparametric mixture model of NNs initialized with meta-learning for supervised learning under nonstationary distributions.", "review": "The paper presents a nonparametric mixture model of neural networks for learning in an environment with a nonstationary distribution. The problem setup includes having access to only a few \"modes\" of the distribution. Training of the initial model occurs with MAML, and distributional changes during test/operation are handled by a combination of online adaptation and creations of new mixture components when necessary. The mixture is nonparametric and modeled with a CRP. The application considered in the paper is RL, and the experiments compare proposed model against baselines that do not utilize meta-learning (achieved in the proposed method with MAML), and baselines which utilize only a single model component.\n\nI thought the combination of meta-learning and a CRP was a neat way to tackle the problem of modeling and learning the \"modes\" of a nonstationary distribution. Applications in other domains would have been nice, but the presented results in RL sufficiently demonstrate the benefits of the proposed method.\n\n* Questions/Comments\n\nFigure 3 left vs right?\n\nIs the test in the middle of Algorithm 1 correct?", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
