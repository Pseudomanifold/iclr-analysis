{"title": "Useful method for online adaptation to sudden changes in the modeled environment", "review": "The paper introduces a method for online adaptation of a model that is expected to adapt to changes in the environment the model models. The method is based on a mixture model, where new models are spawned using a Chinese restaurant process, and where each newly spawned model starts with weights that have been trained using meta-learning to quickly adapt to new dynamics. The method is demonstrated on model-based RL for a few simple benchmarks.\n\nThe proposed method is well justified, clearly presented, and the experimental results are convincing. The paper is generally clear and well written. The method is clearly most useful for situations where the environment suddenly changes, which is relevant in some real-world problems. As a drawback, using a mixture model (that also grows with time) for such modelling can be considered quite heavy in some situations. Nevertheless, the idea of combining a spawning process with meta-learned priors is neat, and clearly works well.\n\nMinor comments:\n- Algorithm 1: is the inequality correct, and is T* supposed to be an argmin instead of argmax?", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
