{"title": "Nice work", "review": "The authors proposed a new method to learn streaming online updates for neural networks with meta-learning and applied it to multi-task reinforcement learning. Model-agnostic meta-learning is used to learn the initial weight and task distribution is learned with the Chinese restaurant process. It sounds like an interesting idea and practical for RL. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\nThe authors said that online updating the meta-learner did not improve the results, which is a bit surprised. Also how many data are meta-trained is not clearly described in the paper. Maybe the authors can compare the results with less data for meta-training.\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
