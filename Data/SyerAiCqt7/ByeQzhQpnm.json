{"title": "poorly written paper, not ready for publication", "review": "Pros:\n-- Clustering sequence vectors is a practical and useful problem. Some of the business use-cases described in the paper are indeed useful and relevant for analytics in healthcare and retail.\n\nCons:\n-- The paper is poorly written. There are numerous typos and grammatical errors throughout the paper. \n-- The ideas are not presented coherently. The writing needs to improve quite a bit to get accepted at a conference like ICLR.\n-- Description of related literature is done very poorly.  \n-- The generative model described clearly lacks justification. The model is not described concretely either. There is no clear description of the inference techniques used.\n-- Empirical results are weak.
