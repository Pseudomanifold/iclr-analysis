{"title": "Both the writing and experiments should be improved", "review": "This paper propose a hierarchical Bayesian model to cluster sparse sequences data. The observations are modeled as Poisson distributions, whose rate parameter \\lambda_i is written as the summation of \\lambda_{ik}, a Gamma distribution with rate equal to the mixture proportion \\alpha_{ik}. The model is implemented in Pystan. Experimental results on a real-world user visit dataset were presented.\n\nThe format of this paper, including the listing in the introduction section, the long url in section 2.3, and the model specification in section 3.2, can be improved. In particular, the presentation of the model would be more clear if the graphical model can be specified. \n\nThe motivation of choosing the observation model and priors is not clear. In section 3, the author described the details of model specification without explaining why those design choices were appropriate for modeling sparse sequence data.\n\nExperimental results on a real-world dataset is presented. However, to demonstrate how the model works, it would be best to add synthetic experiments as sanity check. Results using common baseline approaches should also be presented. The results should also be properly quantified in order to compare the relative advantage of different approaches.", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
