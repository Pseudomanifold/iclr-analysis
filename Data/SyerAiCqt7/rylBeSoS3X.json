{"title": "HIERARCHICAL BAYESIAN MODELING FOR CLUSTERING SPARSE SEQUENCES IN THE CONTEXT OF GROUP PROFILING", "review": "The paper discusses clustering sparse sequences using some mixture model. It discusses results about clustering data obtained from a restaurant loyalty program.\n\nIt is not clear to me what the research contribution of the paper is. What I see is that some known techniques were used to cluster the loyalty program data and some properties of the experiments conducted noted down. No comparisons are made. I am not sure what to evaluate in this paper. ", "rating": "2: Strong rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
