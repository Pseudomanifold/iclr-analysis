{"title": "Review: APPLICATIONS OF GAUSSIAN PROCESSES IN FINANCE", "review": "This paper illustrates how the Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model (GP-LVM) can replace classical linear factor models for the estimation of covariance matrices in portfolio optimization problems. Some experimental results of the global minimal-variance portfolio are presented on a subset of stocks from the S&P 500, comparing against a covariance shrinkage approach. Results from related tasks (missing value imputation and latent space interpretation) are also presented.\n\nIn general, the paper is reasinably easy to understand, although some notation could be better explained (see below). Technically, the paper uses a GP-LVM as a drop-in replacement to a linear factor model for covariance matrix estimation, and does not offer a machine learning contribution. There is also no comparison to Wilson and Ghahramani\u2019s Generalized Wishard Processes. As a contribution to the methodology of portfolio management with machine learning, the paper spends precious pages reviewing well-understood financial theory, and then can offer only superficial evidence of the approach\u2019s benefits. As a contribution to ICLR, the paper should also try to better characterize the quality of the learned representations, against alternatives.\n\nAs such, it would seem fitting for the authors to consider a more financially-oriented venue for presenting their results.\n\nDetailed comments:\n\n* p. 1: Noble Price ==> Nobel Prize (please)\n* p. 2: Start of Section 2.1, surely it is meant $f(\\cdot) \\in R$ instead of $f \\in R$, since $f$, being a function, belongs to some Hilbert space.\n* p. 2: Start of Section 2.2. It would help to state right away that N is the number of assets and D is the number of days (if that\u2019s indeed the case). This is the transpose of the usual data presentation for doing, e.g. PCA, wherein the days are along rows, not columns.\n* p. 2: why is it said that $X \\in R^{N \\times Q}, i.e. it is the number of days whose dimensionality is reduced, and not a smaller number of latent factors driving the cross-section of asset returns. Note that the latter is the assumption behind linear factor models. If the authors intend a different formulation, this should be amply discussed. As it stands, the presentation is confusing.\n* p. 3: the notation $K = k(X,X)$ is confusing. The function $k(\\cdot,cdot)$ was defined for vectors; its extension to matrices should be explained.\n* p. 3: it is stated that the ELBO is \u201cthe best approximation to the posterior\u201d. It is not. It is the best approximation within the variational family, under the KL criterion.\n* p. 3: at the end of that section, it is stated that GP-LVM gives an estimate of the covariance matrix between the N points. A quick recap of how that comes about would help the reader here.\n* p. 5: in eq (19), citations for where those kernels come from would be necessary. It also couldn\u2019t hurt to state that \u201cm32\u201d stands for the Mat\u00e9rn 3/2 kernel.\n* p. 5: in eq (19), shouldn\u2019t all those kernels be multiplied by a magnitude hyperparameter $\\sigma^2$ ?\n* p. 7: The results of Table 1 should be subject to more rigorous analysis. In particular, there should be a test to ensure Sharpe differences are significant, e.g. Liu, Y., Rekkas, M., & Wong, A. (2012).\n* p 8: in Figure 3, it is not clear what\u2019s being plotted exactly. Please refer to an earlier equation.\n\n\nReferences:\n\nLiu, Y., Rekkas, M., & Wong, A. (2012).
