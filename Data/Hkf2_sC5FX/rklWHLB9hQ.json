{"title": "There are some interesting ideas here. A more efficient version of GEM. ", "review": "This paper proposes a variant of GEM called A-GEM that substantially improves the computational characteristics of GEM while achieving quite similar performance. To me the most interesting insight of this work is the proof that an inner product between gradients can suffice instead of needing to solve the quadratic program in GEM \u2013 which I have found to be a major limitation of the original algorithm.  The additional experiments using task descriptors to enable zero shot learning are also interesting.  Moreover, the discussion of the new evaluation protocol and metrics make sense with further clarification from the authors. Overall, I agree with the other reviewers that this paper makes a clear and practical contribution worthy of acceptance. \n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
