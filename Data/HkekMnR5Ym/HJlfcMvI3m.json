{"title": "Details of the architecture not well motivated", "review": "The paper proposes a learnable bloom filter architecture. While the details of the architecture seemed a bit too complicated for me to grasp (see more on this later), via experiments the authors show that the learned bloom filters are more compact that regular bloom filters and can outperform other neural architectures when it comes to retrieving seen items.\n\nA bloom filter is fairly simple, K hash functions hash seen items into K bit vectors. During retrieval, if all of the bits hashed to are 1 then we say we've seen the query. I think there's simpler ways to derive a continuous, differentiable version of this which begs the question why the authors chose a relatively more elaborate architecture involving ZCA transform and first/second moments. Perhaps the authors need to motivate their architecture a bit better.\n\nIn their experiments, a simple LSTM seems to perform remarkably well (it is close to the best in 2 (a), (b); and crashes in (c) but the proposed technique is also outperformed by vanilla bloom filters in (c)). This is not surprising to me since LSTMs are remarkably good at remembering patterns. Perhaps the authors would like to comment on why they did not develop the LSTM further to remedy it of its shortcomings. Some of the positive results attained using neural bloom filters is a bit tempered by the fact that the experiments were using a back up bloom filter. Also, the neural bloom filters do well only when there is some sort of querying pattern. All of these details would seem to reduce the applicability of the proposed approach.\n\nThe authors have addressed most (if not all) of my comments in their revised version. I applaud the authors for being particularly responsive. Their explanations and additional experiments go a long way towards lending the insights that were missing from the original draft of the paper. I have upped my rating to a 7.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
