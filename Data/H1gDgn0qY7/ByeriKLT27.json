{"title": "interesting observation and techniques, but results leave something to be desired", "review": "This paper studies a non-local form of adversarial perturbation, which, to my limited knowledge is new. The form of the perturbation is specific to ReLU activations, but it may be a large set. The authors also devise an algorithm to generate natural-looking perturbations in this set. Instead of updating a seed example through gradient descent, they propose to generate perturbations by combinations of image patches from multiple seed images. The weights of the combination are optimized by a gradient descent like algorithm in a similar manner as standard gradient-based approaches to generating adversarial examples. This produces perturbations that look like ```in-paintings'' or transplants of one seed image onto another. Here are a few comments:\n\n1. The perturbation set is generally a high-dimensional polytope. Although it has a compact representation in terms of intersection of hyperplanes, it may have many more verticies, so the endeavor of attempting to characterize all the verticies of this polytope may be infeasible. \n\n2. This technique of generating adversarial examples from combinations of image patches seems generally applicable, but it does not seems to produce good results here. The perturbations are still unnatural looking (eg. the images in Figure 7 are not exactly natural looking).", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
