{"title": "Not convinced", "review": "Sorry, I am not convinced by this paper.\n\nI just don't believe that one can really gain any useful insight into neural networks by this kind of visualization.  In my opinion, all these kinds of visualization can give is the false believe that one understands what the network is doing.  (If you think about it, understanding itself is a rather vague and subjective term).  I guess my point is, these kinds of visualization don't seem to generate any actionable knowledge.  And how would one even meaningfully compare the outputs of competing methods of this general type?\n\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
