{"title": "A Reinforcement Learning approach to Active Learning", "review": "The authors suggest to model active learning (AL) as a Markov Decision Process to try to learn the best possible AL strategy across related domains. \n\nThe paper is well-written and structured -- although the background section could be expanded. Sec 3 presents the method in a clear and straightforward manner. \n\nMy main concern with regards to the paper is novelty. The authors mention two main contributions, the first one being to defined the AL objective to minimize the number of annotations required to achieve a given prediction quality, instead of maximizing performance given an annotation budget. There has been AL approaches from that perspective in the past (e.g., https://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.02847.pdf). \n\nThe second contribution has to do with a procedure to learn the AL strategy using data from different domains (with available labels). Again, the literature in transfer learning in Reinforcement Learning is extensive and should be discussed.
