{"title": "Nice presentation but missing important reference ", "review": "This paper proposed a general method for image restoration based on GAN. In particular, the latent variable z is optimized based on the MAP framework. And the results are obtained by G(z). This method looks reasonable to achieve good results. However, the idea is very related to Yeh et al.\u2019s work which has already published but not mentioned at all. \n\nYeh, Raymond A., et al. \"Image Restoration with Deep Generative Models.\" 2018 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP). IEEE, 2018.\n\nBoth the proposed method and Yeh et al.\u2019s method optimize the latent variable z of the generator using MAP, although the loss functions are slightly different. In addition, the applications are very similar: image inpainting, denoising, super-resolution etc. Yeh et al.\u2019s method should be the right baseline instead of the nearest neighbor algorithm. \n\nIn addition, the results seem very weak. There are tons of algorithms for image inpainting, denoising, and super-resolution, but the proposed method was not compared with them. The paper claims that only the nearest neighbor algorithm can handle different degradations. This is not true. For example, total variation regularization can do all these tasks. \n\nSome other comments: what are the parameters of the degradation in the applications? For example, in image inpainting, does the proposed method learn the mask as well? So it is blind inpainting? \n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
