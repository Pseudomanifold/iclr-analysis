{"title": "Missing consideration of and comparison to existing work, far from state-of-the-art results", "review": "In this submission, the authors present a variational smoothing interpretation of the data noising approach presented in (Xie et al., 2017). Although the theoretical coverage of the problem gives interesting insights. However, a comparison to related work w.r.t. alternative regularization approaches is missing. Similarly, the perplexity values reported in the experimental results on Penn Treebank are far away from state-of-the-art results published by many competitors on this task, e.g. see the current state-of-the-art results on Penn Treebank by (Yang et al., 2017, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.02573.pdf and references therein). It is bad practice to ignore existing work completely like this. The interesting question here would be, inhowfar the presented smoothing/regularization methods are complementary to existing approaches, and if the presented methods do provide improvements on top of these.\n\nFinally, the mode of language modeling evaluation presented here, without considering an actual language or speech processing task, provides limited insight w.r.t. its utility in actual applications. Moreover, the very limited size of the language modeling tasks chosen here is highly advantageous for smoothing/regularization approaches. It remains totally unclear, how the presented approaches would perform on more realistically sized tasks and within actual applications.\n", "rating": "2: Strong rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
