{"title": "Interesting idea, but unclear contributions", "review": "This paper proposes a new meta-learner for few-shot learning that conditions the parameters of the model on the given query image. The authors argue that this allows the model to focus on features particular to the query, thereby facilitating classification. The paper introduces a kernel generator as a meta-learner and report performance on two standard benchmarks, Omniglot and miniImagenet.\n\nSeveral methods propose meta-learners that adapt the learner\u2019s parameters to the task or each class in the task. This paper adapts to the query itself, which may provide other benefits, and provides a useful complement to prior work on parameter adaptation in few-shot classification.\n\nWhile the core idea itself is clearly articulated, the reading is dense and many of the finer points are vaguely presented. This makes the paper hard to read and its contribution unclear. In particular, the meta objective itself is not defined, the second loss function contains an undefined (learnable?) functions whose role is not entirely clear. In the experimental section, the authors mention that they use Prototypical Networks (Snell et al., 2017) on top of their kernel generator. This puts their contribution in a different light, now as an extension of Snell et al., (2017). I\u2019m also unclear about the novelty of kernel generator the authors supposedly introduce. The kernel generator appears identical to that of Han et at. (2018), in which case the contribution is its application to few-shot learning, not the kernel generator itself.\n\nSince the main contribution of this paper is to condition the learner\u2019s parameters on the query, as opposed to the task or the classes in the task, the relevant comparison is with respect to such alternative methods. Several such benchmarks are missing (below), and when considered, the reported results are relatively weak. \n\nFor an up-to-date collection of benchmarks on miniImagenet, see Rusu et. al., (2018, https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.05960).\n\n===\n\n[1] Gidari and Komodakis.
