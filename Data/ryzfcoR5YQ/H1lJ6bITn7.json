{"title": "Confused...", "review": "I am sorry but I am super confused with this paper. There is no clarity and about half of the sentences are written with broken english. \n\nThe model (as far as I can understand from the partial explanations and Figure 2) looks like a kitchen sink -- a combination of pieces from previously explored methods in the context of traffic flow estimation. This might be fine, but there is no motivation provided for this. \n\nRather than spending the method section with repeating well known Loss equations, KL-divergence, convolution, etc... Please focus on the architecture provided in the paper and the motivations behind it. More importantly, how it differs from previous approaches and why these choices have been made. \n\nThis paper is not ready for publication. It needs a re-write at least, preferably working out the original motivations behind architectural choices.
