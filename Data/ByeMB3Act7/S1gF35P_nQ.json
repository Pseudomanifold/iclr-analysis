{"title": "I like the pape", "review": "The paper proposes a way to speed up softmax at test time, especially when top-k words are needed. The idea is clustering inputs so that we need only to pick up words from a learn cluster corresponding to the input. The experimental results show that the model looses a little bit accuracy in return of much faster inference at test time. \n\n* pros: \n- the paper is well written. \n- the idea is simple but BRILLIANT. \n- the used techniques are good (especially to learn word clusters). \n- the experimental results  (speed up softmax at test time) are impressive. \n\n* cons: \n- the model is not end-to-end because word clusters are not continuous. But it not an important factor. \n- it can only speed up softmax at test time. I guess users are more interesting in speeding up at both test and training time.\n- it would be better if the authors show some clusters for both input examples and corresponding word clusters.\n\n\n", "rating": "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
