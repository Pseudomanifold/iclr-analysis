{"title": "Technical contribution is not high, but good performing approach on several image restoration tasks", "review": "- Summary\nThis paper proposes a residual non-local attention network for image restoration. Specifically, the proposed method has local and non-local attention blocks to extract features which capture long-range dependencies. The local and non-local blocks consist of trunk branch and (non-) local mask branch. The proposed method is evaluated on image denoising, demosaicing, compression artifacts reduction, and super-resolution.\n\n- Pros\n  - The proposed method shows better performance than existing image restoration methods.\n  - The effect of each proposed technique such as the mask branch and the non-local block is appropriately evaluated.\n\n- Cons\n  - It would be better to provide the state-of-the-art method[1] in the super-resolution task. \n    [1] Y. Zhang et al., Image Super-Resolution Using Very Deep Residual Channel Attention Networks, ECCV, 2018.\n  - The technical contribution of the proposed method is not high, because the proposed method seems to be just using existing methods.\n  - The contribution of the non-local operation is not clear to me. For example, how does the global information (i.e., long-range dependencies between pixels) help to solve image denoising tasks such as image denoising?\n\nOverall, the technical contribution of the proposed method is not so high, but the proposed method is valuable and promising if we focus on the performance.\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
