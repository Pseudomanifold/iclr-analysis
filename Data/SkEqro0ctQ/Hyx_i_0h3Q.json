{"title": "Interesting hierarchical approach to explainability", "review": "This paper proposes a hierarchical extension of contextual decomposition. The approach is validated in qualitative examples and a small scale usability study\n\nQuality, \nThe paper is well motivated. Contextual decomposition is briefly described but detailed enough to self-contained. The experimental evaluation produces usability evidence. Uncertainty could have been better explained, \n\nClarity, \nThe main methodological contribution (hierarchical CD) is well motivated but only  provided in the form of an algorithm. Could have been more precisely described and optimality discussed. \n\nOriginality & significance\nThe work builds heavily on CD but has the hierarchical extension is original and significant. \nUncertainty estimates could have improved the significance of the usability study\n\npros and cons\n+ interesting problem\n+ well-motivated algorithmic extension of CD\n- uncertainty of usability experiment?\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
