{"title": "It is a paper written in a rush that its clarity is a main problem.", "review": "The authors are providing an information theoretic viewpoint on the behavior of DNN based on the information bottleneck.  The clarity of the paper is my main concern.  It contains quite a number of typos and errors.  For example, in section 6, the results of MNIST in the first experiment was presented after introducing the second experiment.  Also, the results shown in Fig 1b seems to have nothing to do with Fig. 1a.  It makes use of some existing results from other literature but it is not clearly explained how and why the results are being used.   It might be a very good paper if the writing could be improved.   The paper also contains some experimental results.  But they are too brief and I do not consider the experiments as sufficient to justify the correctness of the bounds proved in the paper.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
