{"title": "Interesting new architecture, but some clarity issues", "review": "This paper introduces a new stochastic neural network architecture for sequence modeling. The model as depicted in figure 2 has a ladder-like sequence of deterministic convolutions bottom-up and stochastic Gaussian units top-down.\n\nI'm afraid I have a handful of questions about aspects of the architecture that I found confusing. I have a difficult time relating my understanding of the architecture described in figure 2 with the architecture shown in figure 1 and the description of the wavenet building blocks. My understanding of wavenet matches what is shown in the left of figure 1: the convolution layers d_t^l depend on the convolutional layers lower-down in the model, thus with each unit d^l having dependence which reaches further and further back in time as l increases. I don't understand how to reconcile this with the computation graph in figure 2, which proposes a model which is Markov! In figure 2, each d_{t-1}^l depends only on on the other d_{t-1} units and the value of x_{t-1}, which then (in the left diagram of figure 2) generate the following x_t, via the z_t^l. Where did the dilated convolutions go\u2026? I thought at first this was just a simplification for the figure, but then in equation (4), there is d_t^l = Conv^{(l)}(d_t^{l-1}). Shouldn't this also depend on d_{t-1}^{l-1}\u2026? or, where does the temporal information otherwise enter at all? The only indication I could find is in equation (13), which has a hidden unit defined as d_t^1 = Conv^{(1)}(x_{1:t}).\n\nAdding to my confusion, perhaps, is the way that the \"inference network\" and \"prior\" are described as separate models, but sharing parameters. It seems that, aside from the initial timesteps, there doesn't need to be any particular prior or inference network at all: there is simply a transition model from x_{t-1} to x_{t}, which would correspond to the Markov operator shown in the left and middle sections of figure 2. Why would you ever need the right third of figure 2? This is a model that estimates z_t given x_t. But, aside from at time 0, we already have a value x_{t-1}, and a model which we can use to estimate z_t  given x_{t-1}\u2026!\n\nWhat are the top-to-bottom functions f^{(l)} and f^{(o)}? Are these MLPs?\n\nI also was confused in the experiments by the >= and <= on the reported numbers. For example, in table 2, the text describes the values displayed as log-likelihoods, in which case the ELBO represents a lower bound. However, in that case, why is the bolded value the *lowest* log-likelihood? That would be the worst model, not the best \u2014 does table 2 actually show negative log-likelihoods, then? In which case, though, the numbers from the ELBO should be upper bounds, and the >= should be <=. Looking at figure 4, it seems like visually the STCN and VRNN have very good reconstructions, but the STCN-dense has visual artifacts; this would correspond with the numbers in table 2 being log-likelihoods (not negative), in which case I am confused only by the choice of which model to bold.\n\n\n\nUPDATE:\n\nThanks for the clarifications and edits. FWIW I still find the depiction of the architecture in Figure 2 to be incredibly misleading, as well as the decision to omit dependencies from the distributions p and q at the top of page 5, as well as the use in table 3 of \"ELBO\" to refer to a *negative* log likelihood.\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
