{"title": "Mechanical Approach to Augmenting Networks Incrementally for Lifelong Learning", "review": "The authors provided a training scheme that ensures network retains old performance as new data sets are encountered (e.g. (a) same class no drift, (b) same class with drift, (c) new class added). They do this by incrementally adding FC layers to the network, memory component that stores previous precomputed features, and the objective is a coupling between classification loss on lower level features and a feature-loss on retaining properties of older distributions. The results aren't very compelling and the approach looks like a good engineering solution without strong theoretical support or grounding.
