{"title": "Principled approach to hyperparameter tuning but only evaluated on small scale problems to-date.", "review": "The paper proposes a bilevel optimization approach for hyperparameter tuning. This idea is not new having been proposed in works prior to the current resurgence of deep learning (e.g., Do et al., 2007, Domke 2012, and Kunisch & Pock, 2013). However, the combination of bilevel optimization for hyperparameter tuning with approximation is interesting. Moreover, the proposed approach readily handles discrete parameters.\n\nExperiments are run on small scale problems, namely, CIFAR-10 and PTB. Results are encouraging but not stellar. More work would need to be done to validate the utility of the proposed approach on larger scale problems.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
