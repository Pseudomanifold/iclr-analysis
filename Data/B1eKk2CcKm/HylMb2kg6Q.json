{"title": "motivation is good, the method is not well explained and is not scalable, the claims are not well supported by experiments", "review": "This paper aimed to dig more information into the raw RNA-seq data, in a reference-free fashion, which would not be captured and analyzed in usual RNA-seq pipelines. The method was to compute continuous embeddings for kmer sequences from the raw reads. The authors emphasized its potential use in detecting patient or tumor specific structural variations which is still a challenging task. In general, the paper is interesting. However, the novelty is limited and the developed algorithm is not yet scalable to genome-wide analysis.\n\n- It is natural to adapt the word2vec model to biological sequencing reads, which is already seen in the literature. This paper focused on k-mer sequences, which is a good thought. But, for k-mer computing, it is important to make it fast, scalable and representative.\n\n- \"The method uses the factorized embedding model (Trofimov et al., 2017) combined with an RNN.\" Why does such combination work? What is your motivation to use RNN for k-mer sequences? How does it work? Unfortunately, the paper did not provide such details.\n\n- \"For all our experiments we used aligned, unquantified RNA-Seq data (BAM format files) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (Weinstein et al., 2013).\" I was confused for this experimental settings. I thought the paper focused on reference-free fashion as mentioned from the beginning of the paper. How do you support your claims by such data collection policy?\n\n\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
