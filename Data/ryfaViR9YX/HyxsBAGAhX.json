{"title": "Interesting Work", "review": "The paper proposes a generative network capable of generating variations of a given input, conditioned on an attribute. Earlier papers generated variations of the input in the presence of the attribute and this attribute was assumed to be known during training. This paper proposes to automatically discover these attribute and thus work to produce variations even in the absence of known attribute information.\n\nThe paper is dense, but it is well written. It has mixed ideas from several papers - the basic VAE architecture, combined with a discriminator and regularizations over latent space. The key thing, of course, is the design of the attribute function. There seems to be an interesting interaction between the encoder, discriminator and the attribute function that requires more investigation. This is acknowledged in the conclusion as well.\n\nThe work is original and the results on the MNIST dataset are very interesting. I think the significance of this work lies in the fact that this can be a starting point for several interesting future works in this direction.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}
