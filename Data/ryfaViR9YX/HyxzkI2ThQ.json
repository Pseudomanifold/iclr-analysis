{"title": "Lack of clarity and almost no experiments", "review": "This paper proposes a generalization of variational auto-encoders to account for meta-data (attributes), learning new ones, in a way that these can be controlled to generate new samples. The model learns how to decouple the attributes in an adversarial way by means of a discriminator. The problem is interesting, but I found two main issues with this paper:\n1.- Lack of clarity: I found the paper difficult to follow, even after reading Sec. 2 and 3 several times.\n2.- Almost absence of experiments: The paper only has one experiment, which is in the appendix, and is about sampling using the MNIST dataset. Given that this paper proposes a model, whose properties can be assessed by means of experiments, the fact that there is nothing of the kind provides no support to any benefits the model may have.\n\nOther points:\nWhat in the model prevents the solution of z_* being just random (independently of x)?\n\nThis paper seems relevant Esser, Patrick, Ekaterina Sutter, and Bj\u00f6rn Ommer. \"A Variational U-Net for Conditional Appearance and Shape Generation.\" Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. 2018.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
