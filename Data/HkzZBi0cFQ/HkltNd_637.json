{"title": "Novelty is limited", "review": "This paper proposes an new 8-bit quantization strategy for rapid deployment. \n\n8-bit quantization has attracted many attentions recently. And it is already well used in GPU servers (cudnn), phones, ARM chips and various ASIC neural network chips. In these situations, almost no performance drop is observed for classification and detection tasks.\n\nSo, the novelty of this paper is limited.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
