{"title": "Universal Successor Feature Approximators", "review": "This paper proposes new ideas in the context of deep multi-task learning for RL. Ideas seem to me to be a rather small (epsiilon) improvement over the cited works.\n\nThe main problem - to me - with described approach is that the Q* value now lives in a much higher dimensional space, levelling any advantage a subsequent heuristic might give. \n\nStatements as 'Although this work is superficially similar to ours, it differs a lot in the details' makes clear that this work is only of potential interest for a rather small audience, a tenet also supported by the density of presentation. I leave it to the AC to decide on relevance. \n\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}
