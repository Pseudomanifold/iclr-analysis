{"title": "Interesting but requires more experiments", "review": "This work proposes a CNN based language model based on graph neural networks. Basic idea is to compute adjacency matrix for an entire sentence in parallel for faster computation. Empirical results show probably the best performance among CNN approaches but still lags behind the best RNNs.\n\nPros:\n\n- A new network based on graph neural networks.\n\nCons:\n\n- The proposed model needs to recompute attention probabilities for each step and it might incur latencies. I'd like to know how slow it is when compared with other CNN approaches and how fast it is when compared with other RNNs.\n\n- Lacking experiments. This paper shows only a single table comparing other approaches, and does not present any ablation studies. Note that section 4.4 mentions some details, but does not show any numbers to justify the claim, e.g., why choosing the window size of 10, 20, 30, 40.\n\n- This paper claims that the learned model captures the ground truth parse tree in section 4.3. However, this work simply picks a single example in section 5.3 to justify the claim. I'd recommend the author to run a parser to see if the proposed attention mechanism actually capture the ground truth parse trees or not.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
