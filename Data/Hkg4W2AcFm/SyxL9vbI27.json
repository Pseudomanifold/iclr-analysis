{"title": "Need more quantitative experiments to justify the claims. ", "review": "This paper proposed a novel approach for learning disentangled representation from supervised data (x as the input image, y as different attributes), by learning an encoder E and a decoder D so that (1) D(E(x)) reconstructs the image, (2) E(D(x)) reconstruct the latent vector, in particular for the vectors that are constructed by mingling different portion of the latent vectors extracted from two training samples, (3) the Jacobian matrix matches and (4) the predicted latent vector matches with the provided attributes. In addition, the work also proposes to progressively add latent nodes to the network for training. The claim is that using this framework, one avoid GAN-style training (e.g., Fader network) which could be unstable and hard to tune. \n\nAlthough the idea is interesting, the experiments are lacking. While previous works (e.g., Fader network) has both qualitative (e.g., image quality when changing attribute values) and quantitative results (e.g., classification results of generated image with novel combination of attributes), this paper only shows visual comparison (Fig. 4 and Fig. 5), and its comparison with Fader network is a bit vague (e.g., it is not clear to me why Fig. 5(e) generated by proposed approach is \u201cmore natural\u201d than Fig. 5(d), even if I check the updated version mentioned by the authors' comments). Also in the paper there are five hyperparameters (Eqn. 14) and the center claim is that using Jacobian loss is better. However, there is no ablation study to support the claim and/or the design choice. From my opinion, the paper should show the performance of supervised training of attributes, the effects of using Jacobian loss and/or cycle loss, the inception score of generated images, etc. \n\nI acknowledge the authors for their honesty in raising the issues of Fig. 4, and providing an updated version.
