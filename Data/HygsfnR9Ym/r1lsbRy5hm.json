{"title": "adding another direction to the model increases the sampling efficiency ", "review": "The authors propose a bidirectional model for learning a policy. In particular, a backtracking model was proposed to start from a high-value state and sample back the sequence of actions and states that could lead to the current high-value state. These traces can be used later for learning a good policy. The experiments show the effectiveness of the model in terms of increase the expected rewards in different tasks. However, learning the backtracking model would add some computational efforts to the entire learning phase. I would like to see experiments to show the computational time for these components. \n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
