{"title": "Combing Patch-level CNN and BoF model has been done before, but the paper has the smallest patch", "review": "The idea of image classification based on patch-level deep feature in the BoF model has been studied extensively.  \n\n Just list few of them:\n\nWei et al. HCP: A Flexible CNN Framework for Multi-label Image Classification, IEEE TPAMI 2016\nTang et al. Deep Patch Learning for Weakly Supervised Object Classification and Discovery, Pattern Recognition 2017\nTang et al. Deep FisherNet for Object Classification, IEEE TNNLS\nArandjelovi\u0107 et al. NetVLAD: CNN Architecture for Weakly Supervised Place Recognition, CVPR 2016\n\nThe above papers are not cited in this paper.\n\nThere are some unique points. This work does not use RoIPooling layer and has results on ImageNet. But, the previous works use RoIPooling layer to save computations and works on scene understanding images, such as PASCAL. \n\nBesides, the paper uses the smallest patch among all the patch-based deep networks. It is interesting.\n\nI highly encourage the authors to finetune the ImageNet pre-trained BagNet on PASCAL VOC and compare to the previous patch-based deep networks.\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
