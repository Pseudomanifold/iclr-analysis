{"title": "This paper is worth being accepted. The bag-of-words information in the neural network is important for high prediction accuracy. Possibly has high impact in the community and need to be further investigated.", "review": "This paper suggests a novel and compact neural network architecture which uses the information within bag-of-words features. The proposed algorithm only uses the patch information independently and performs majority voting using independently classified patches. The proposed method provides the state-of-the-art prediction accuracy unexpectedly, and several additional experiments show the state-of-the-art neural networks mainly learn without association between information in different patches.\n\nThe proposed algorithm is simple and does not provide completely new idea, but this paper has a clear contribution connecting the previous main idea of feature extraction, bag-of-words, and the prevailing blackbox algorithm, CNN. The results in the paper are worth to be shared in the community and need further investigated.\n\nThe presented experiments look fair and reasonable to show the importance of the independent patch information (without association between them), and the presented experimental results show some state-of-the-art methods also perform with independent patch information. \n\nComparison with attention models is necessary to compare the important patches obtained from conventional networks.\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
