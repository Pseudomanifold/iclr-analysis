{"title": "Interesting analysis of the contributions of different neurons in NMT", "review": "This paper presents unsupervised approaches to discover import neurons in\nneural machine translation systems. Some linguistic properties controlled by the\ndiscovered neurons are discussed and analyzed.\n\nStrengths:\n\nThe paper is well-written and provides valuable information to understand the\nbehaviour of neural machine translation models.\n\nThe ability to control characteristics (such as gender) without training\nspecialized models is promising, even if the results are not good enough for\nimmediate use. It would be interesting to see whether controlling neurons\nin the decoder would be more effective.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\nMultiple NMT systems are necessary to discover important neurons. The authors\nmention that it would be possible to use different checkpoints from a single\nmodel, but don't evaluate how well this would work.\n\nThe findings in this paper do not lead to immediate translation performance\nimprovements.\n\nQuestions and other remarks:\n\nIn Table 4a, why are there 2 results for \"-0.25, -0.125, 0\"?\n\nIn section 4.3 (Tense), it may be worthwhile to mention that the neuron is\nhighly activated on the word \"Spreads\", even if it acts as a noun in this\nspecific sentence.\n\nBottom of p. 6: \"Our supervised methods\" -> \"Our unsupervised methods\"\n\nTo control properties, could SVCCA directions or coefficients be manipulated?\n\nSome parentheses around citations are missing or misplaced.\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
