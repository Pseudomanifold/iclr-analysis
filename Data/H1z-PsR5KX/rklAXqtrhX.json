{"title": "This paper presents unsupervised methods for ranking neurons in machine translation. Important neurons are thus identified and used to control the MT output.", "review": "Strengths:\n- even though the methods for detecting important neurons are not novel (as also stated in the paper), their application to MT is novel\n- the presentation is very clear\n- the choice of methods is well argued and justified\n- the experiments are well executed and analysed\n- thorough and varied analysis of the experimental findings \n\nI recommend this paper for the best paper award.", "rating": "10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
