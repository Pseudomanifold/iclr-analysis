{"title": "using cumulative saliency as guidance for model pruning", "review": "In this paper, the authors propose to use cumulative saliency as guidance for model pruning. In particular, when designing saliency, they introduce a balanced formula by taking the filter size and gradient value into account.  The paper is well organized, and extensive experiments are investigated.  However, the novelty is relatively limited. The advantage of the proposed method is marginal on ImageNet, when comparing with the relevant approaches.
