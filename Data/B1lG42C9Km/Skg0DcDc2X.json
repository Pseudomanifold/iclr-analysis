{"title": "Review of Paper \"Intrinsic Social Motivation via Causal Influence in Multi-Agent RL\"", "review": "This paper proposes an approach to model social influence in a scenario-independent manner by instantiating the concept of intrinsic motivation and combine various human abilities as part of a reinforcement learning function in order to improve the agent's operation in social dilemma scenarios. \n\nAgents are operationalised as convolutional neural network, linear layers and LSTM. Using these base mechanisms, different abilities (communication, models of other agents (MOA)), their causal influence is inferred based on counterfactual actions. The architecture is explored across two different sequential social dilemmas. \n\nThe architecture is described in sufficient detail, with particular focus on the isolation of causal influence for communication and MOA influence. The experimental evaluation is described in sufficient detail, given the low complexity of the scenarios. While the agents with communicative ability and MOA show superior performance, a few results warrant clarification.\n\nFigure 6a) highlights the performance of influencers in contrast to a visible actions baseline. This specific scenarios shows the necessity to run experiments for larger number of runs, since it appears that action observations may actually outperform influencer performance beyond 3 steps. Please clarify what is happening in this specific case, and secondly, justify your choice of steps used in the experimental evaluation. \n\nAnother results that requires clarification is Figure 6f), which is not sufficiently discussed in the text, yet provides interesting patterns between the MOA baseline performance decaying abruptly at around 3 steps, with the influence MOA variant only peaking after that. Please clarify the observation. Also, could you draw conclusions or directions for a combination of the different approaches to maximise the performance (more generally, beyond this specific observation)? \n\nA valuable discussion is the exemplification of specific agent behaviour on Page 7. While it clarifies the signalling of resources in this specific case, it also shows shortcomings of the model's realism. How would the model perform if agents had limited resources and would die upon depletion (e.g. the de facto altruistic influencer in this scenario - since it only performs two distinct actions)? The extent of generalisability should be considered in the discussion. \n\nIn general, the paper motivates and discusses the underlying work in great detail and is written in an accessible manner (minor comment: the acronym LSTM is not explicitly introduced). The quality of presentation is good. ", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
