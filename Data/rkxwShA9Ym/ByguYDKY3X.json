{"title": "Interesting approach, and unique use cases", "review": "This paper presents a method to super-resolve coarse low-res segmentation labels, if the joint distribution of low-res and high-res labels are known. The problem formulation and the proposed solution are valid, given the examples of land cover super-resolution and lymphocyte segmentation.\nI like the paper in general, with the following concerns/thoughts:\n1. While matching the divergence of low-res and high-res segmentations, will the model simply collapse and predict noisy boundaries? Or is it already the case, as can be seen in Figure 8 of Appendix? It seems possible that the model is learning high resolution noises. I suggest the authors to do more careful analysis on this.\n2. I am curious to see if the proposed technique can be used in other aspects, like super-resolving the boundary of semantic segmentations.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
