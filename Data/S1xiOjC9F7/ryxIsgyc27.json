{"title": " Interesting  application but inadequate experiments", "review": "The authors introduce a Graph Matching Network for retrieval and matching of graph structured objects. The proposed methods demonstrates improvements compared to baseline methods. However, I have have three main concerns: \n1) Unconvining experiments.\n\ta) Experiments in Sec4.1. The experiments seem not convincing. Firstly, no details of dataset split is given. Secondly, I am suspicious the proposed model is overfitted, although proposed GSL models seem to bring some improvements on the WL kernel method. As shown in Tab.3, performance of GSL models dramatically decreases when adapting to graphs with more nodes or edges. Besides, performance of the proposed GSLs also drops when adapting to different combines of k_p and k_n as pointed in Sec.B.1. However, the baseline WL kernel method demonstrates favourable generalization ability.\n\n\tb\uff09Experiments in Sec4.2. Only holding out 10% data into the testing set is not a good experiment setting and easily results in overfitting. The authors are suggested to hold more data out for testing. Besides, I wonder the generalization ability of the proposed model. The authors are suggested to test on the small unrar dataset mentioned in Sec.B.2 with the proposed model trained on the ffmpeg dataset in Sec4.2.\n\n2) Generalization ability. The proposed model seems sensitive to the size and edge density of the graphs. The authors is suggested to add experiments mentioned in (1).\n\n3) Inference time and model size. Although the proposed model seems to achieve increasing improvements with the increasing propagation layers. I wonder the cost of inference time and model size compared to baselines methods.
