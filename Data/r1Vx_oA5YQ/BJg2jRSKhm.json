{"title": "eye-catching image manipulation but lack justification in real use", "review": " This paper proposed a so-called ISS-GAN framework for data hiding in images, which  integrates steganography and steganalysis processes in GAN. The discriminative model simulate the steganalysis process, and the steganography generative model is to generate stego image, and confuse steganalysis discriminative model. \n\nOverall the application seems interesting. My concern is its use in real secure information transmission systems: it can fool human eyes but what is its capacity against decoding algorithms; if the intent is to transmit some hidden information, how the receiver is supposed to decode it; is there something similar to the public key in encryption systems? These basic questions/concepts should be made clear to the reader to avoid confusion. \n\nThe evaluation protocol should be clarified and especially on how the PSNR is calculated (i.e., using the reconstructed secret image and real one?)
