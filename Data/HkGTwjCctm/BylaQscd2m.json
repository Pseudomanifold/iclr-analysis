{"title": "Interesting deep architecture for multi-variate time series modeling, lacks proper comparison with existing literature", "review": "1. This papers leverages the concept of wavelet transform within a deep architecture to solve the classic problem (especially for wavelet analysis) of change point detection. The authors do a reasonably comprehensive job of demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed framework using various synthetic and real data sets with both gradual and abrupt changes\n\n2. The concept of pyramid network idea is not really new, in the context of CNN it has been established quite well. The paper should highlight this fact by citing papers such as \"Lin, Tsung-Yi, et al. \"Feature Pyramid Networks for Object Detection.\" CVPR. Vol. 1. No. 2. 2017.\" \n\n3. Involving wavelet transforms in deep nets have been done before. This paper attempts to learn wavelet transform parameters by involving them as trainable layers. But even this kind of idea is also emerging in the community. Papers such as \"Fujieda, Shin, Kohei Takayama, and Toshiya Hachisuka. \"Wavelet Convolutional Neural Networks.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1805.08620 (2018)\" need to be discussed in this context. \n\n4. The biggest issue in my mind is that I feel \"Chung et al 2016\" is still a very similar framework as the proposed one. While authors argue that it uses more like CNN architecture and the proposed method may pick up the multi-scale features better, comparison with this seems to be most appropriate. This will also clearly identify the benefits of the wavelet structure to the filters and multi-resolution analysis approaches.\n\n5. RCNN term has been used for CNN+RNN architecture. This may not be a good terminology to use since RCNN is a very popular term referring to Region based CNN for detection and localization purposes.\n\n6. AUC metric, I believe is the - area under ROC curve, this needs to be spelled out, how it is computed? at least in the Appendix\n\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n\nAppreciate the authors' rebuttal, updated my score.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
