{"title": "Two relatively separate ideas, both warranting some more discussion", "review": "This paper is a combination of two main and only vaguely related parts: one is a set of theoretical results regarding the existence of policy gradients for MDPs with deterministic (or mixed deterministic and stochastic) state transitions, and the other one is a new algorithm (GDPB) combining model-free and model-based policy gradients.\n\nThe theoretical results seem to me like they further the understanding of DPG. This is more clearly the case for the negative result. For the mixture-of-deterministic-and-stochastic-transitions result, however, I might be missing something but I don\u2019t see how the way that the two models are combined does not simply produce a stochastic transition model. Even disregarding this, I am not sure the particular combination of transition models they look at is that relevant for real-world tasks - for me it would be much more important to deal with the setting where some state features have deterministic transitions and others do not.\n\nI would have liked to see a more in-depth discussion of the model-based approach, in particular using the upper-bounded model-based value functions, as it seems like it could be a promising general technique. One thing that wasn\u2019t clear to me was why the improvement in the lower-bound objective guarantees an improvement in the original objective, which seems like a key argument. \n\nThe empirical results look reasonable, although I am always a bit suspicious of introducing a new parameter (alpha in this case) that is tuned using the benchmark domains.\n\nIn summary, I would have given this paper a higher rating if I had been convinced of either the real-world relevance of their positive theoretical result, or the  generality of the GDPG algorithm.\n\nOne minor comment is that the * subscript notation is a bit confusing, as * is typically used for the optimal value / policy.\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
