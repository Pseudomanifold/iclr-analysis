{"title": "Interesting problem often faced in practice", "review": "Summary\n========\nThe paper addresses the problem of irregular spacing in sequential data with five different irregularity types. The solution is based on modifying LSTM cell.\n\nComment\n========\nIrregular and multiple spacing presents in many real world applications with time-stamped events. The problem is therefore important to address properly. However, I found the evaluation of the proposed solution is less convincing. The main results in Figure 5 are not informative. \n\nThere have been related works addressing irregular and multiple spacing (not just missing data as cited in the paper):\n\n- Pham, T., Tran, T., Phung, D., & Venkatesh, S.
