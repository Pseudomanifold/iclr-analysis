{"title": "a study of time series feature types for RNN models", "review": "The paper addresses limitations of the LTSM method for modeling time series. The work is motivated by applications where multiple time series need to be combined while they may get updated in an asynchronous fashion. Authors mention IoT applications in the Intro and give examples from a power consumption data set and a churn prediction application in their numerical experiments sections. \nThe paper's main contribution is to shrink down time series into 5 different categories which have different sampling schemes: (1) dense (2) sparse (3) decay (4) static decay (3) static standard, and proposing building blocks to incorporate these in a unified recurrent mechanism. \nThe paper's motivation for introducing sparse input to LTSM was rather straightforward and convincing, and the churn prediction application is an excellent motivation for this. I had a harder time following why the 3 other types of features needed to be included as well at this point. Perhaps a more problem oriented explanation with concrete examples could have helped. Or those features should not yet be used as generalizations but kept for future work.\nOverall I think the paper has several interesting ideas. Even though not all are as convincing, I think the paper is thought provoking and may interest the ICLR community.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
