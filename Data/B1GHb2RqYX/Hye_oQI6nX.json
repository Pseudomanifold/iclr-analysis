{"title": "A poorly motivated attempt at reducing the number of CNN model parameters", "review": "Poly-CNN is an attempt at reducing the number of filter variables by using the polynomial transformation of filters to create blow-up the filter responses. In the most aggressive scenario, a single filter and its transformations are used. I think that this approach might be motivated in the very early layers of a vision network, but can hardly be a good idea in higher layers, since they require increasingly specific features for a small subset of the overall image-space to be learned.  So, in my opinion one cannot expect good results with unaltered versions of this idea. The exceedingly lackluster results on imagenet and cifar10 (compared to very weak baselines) back up this intuition. In addition, the paper completely ignores the literature on reducing the parameter count with truly minimal effect on quality (e.g. hashing trick https://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.04788.pdf or Xception https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.02357.pdf).\n\nThe idea of using polynomial transformation is not new, as the author(s) note(s), but in this setup it is backed up with neither with intuitive arguments nor with decent experimental results.\n", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
