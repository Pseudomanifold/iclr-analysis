{"title": "summary", "review": "The paper proposes to apply neural network to compute the committor function arose from physics, which looks an interesting application problem by employing machine learning algorithms. Typically, I know very well that the BG distribution usually has multi-modes which makes the sampling difficult extremely. The authors then employ the importance sampling for possibly explore the whole variable space. It seems to me the only possible contribution is parameterize the committor function by using a neural network.\nThe committor function is parametrized by using a neural network. My first concern is the training data. How would you collect the training data? It is well-known that a neural network works best when there are plenty of training data. Presumably when you are collecting the data, you are basically calculate the committor function and so that you may be able to directly solve the variational problem. \nImportance sampling: I would not consider the importance sampling as a big deal concerning the contribution of the paper. You could employ a series of importance distributions which could result in many more samples. Have you also looked at the Uniform distribution?\nThe paper targets high-dimensional problem. However, in the experiments, the problems do not look really like high-dimensional problems.\nSome notations need to be clarified, for example, the Nabla, the Delta, and as well as the dot operator.\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
