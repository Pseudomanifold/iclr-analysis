{"title": "An interesting idea for applying meta-learning to a problem of learning auxiliary tasks in a self-supervised fashion", "review": "Summary:\nThe role of auxiliary tasks is to improve the generalization performance of the principal task of interest. So far, hand-crafted auxiliary tasks are generated, tailored for a problem of interest. The current work addresses a meta-learning approach to automatically generate auxiliary tasks suited to the principal task, without human knowledge.  The key components of the method are: (1) meta-generator; (2) multi-task evaluator. These two models are trained using the gradient-based meta-learning technique (for instance, MAML).  The problem of image classification is considered only, while authors claimed the method can be easily applied to other problems as well. \n\nStrengths:\n- To my best knowledge, the idea of applying the meta-learning to the automatic generation of auxiliary tasks is novel. \n- The paper is well written and easy to read.\n- The method nicely blends a few components such as self-supervised learning, meta-learning, auxiliary tasks into a single model to tackle the meta auxiliary learning. \n\nWeakness:\n- The performance gain is not substantial in experiments. I would like to suggest to use the state-of-the-arts classifier for the principal task and to evaluate how much gain your method can get with the help of auxiliary tasks. You can refer to the state-of-the-arts performance on CIFAR.\n- If the information on the hierarchy of sub-categories is not available, it will be an annoying hyperparameters that should be well tuned.\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
