{"title": "Approach is reasonable, but insufficient experiment and evidence", "review": "This paper presents an iterative approach to separate unobserved distribution signal from a mixture with observed distribution. The proposed approach looks reasonable to me, however, the experiment and analysis are insufficient.\n1. At test time, does the input also go through the same number of iterations (10)? I would like to see how the separated results evolve over iterations.\n2. It is not clear what is the quality of samples generated by GLO. In the image separation task, GLOM performs better than GAN, but worse in other tasks. Analysis is needed here.\n3.  I noticed that only in the music separation task, finetuning is significantly better than vanilla NES. Is it because generative models can synthesize more realistic data samples? For example, would the generator learn to synthesize X+B with temporal synchronization? More analysis is also needed here.\n\n============================\n\nI think the reviewer addressed my questions and concerns in the rebuttal, so I raised my rating to 6.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
