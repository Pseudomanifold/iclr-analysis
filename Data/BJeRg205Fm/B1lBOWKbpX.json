{"title": "Unoriginal and unfortunately unfocused contributions", "review": "The authors use neural networks to parameterize conditional probability distributions. This is well-known and has been applied in the literature since extensions to generalized linear models beyond their canonical link function in the 70s. Their transformation from real-valued network output to, say, strictly positive concentration parameters in a Dirichlet are worth studying; but they don't analyze this in any detail.\n\nIn addition, while lacking novelty may be fine in and of itself, the purpose of applying these ideas doesn't have a focused purpose. For example, the authors argue in the abstract this quantifies uncertainty. That's only true if you care about data noise, but the end-result is still point estimation for the parameters with uncalibrated probabilities. In the rest of the paper, they write primarily about simplex-valued outputs (i.e., soft one-hot labels).", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
