{"title": "Interesting approach.", "review": "This paper proposes Permutation Phase Defense (PPD), a novel image hiding method to resist adversarial attacks. PPD relies on safekeeping of the key, specifically the seed used for permuting the image pixels. The paper demonstrated the method on MNIST and CIFAR10, and evaluates it against a number of adversarial attacks. The method appears to be robust across attacks and distortion levels.\n\nThe idea is clearly presented and evaluated. \n\n*Details to Improve*\nIt would be interesting to see how performance degrades if the opponent trains with an ensemble of random keys.\n\nIt would be great to see this extended to convolutional networks.\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
