{"title": "Interesting paper that proposes a way to control the spectrum of the networks weights", "review": "The paper is a natural extension of [1] which shows the importance of spectral normalization to encourage diversity of the discriminator weights in a GAN. A simple and effective parametrization of the weights similar to SVD is used: W = USV^T is used along with an orthonormal penalty on U and V and spectral penalty to control the decay of the spectrum. Unlike other parametrizations of orthogonal matrices which are exact but computationally expensive, the proposed one tends to be very accurate in practice and much faster.  A generalization bound is provided that shows the benefit of controlling the spectral norm. Experimental results show that the method is accurate in constraining the orthonormality of U and V and in controlling the spectrum. The experiments also show a marginal improvement of the proposed method over SN-GAN [1].\nHowever, the following it is unclear why one would want to control the whole spectrum when theorem 2 only involves the spectral norm. In [1], it is argued that this encourages diversity in the weights which seems intuitive. However, it seems enough to use Spectral Normalization to achieve such purpose empirically according to that same paper. It would be perhaps good to have an example where SN fails to control the spectrum in a way that significantly impacts the performance of the algorithm while the proposed method doesn't.\n\nOverall the paper is clearly written and the proposed algorithm effectively controls the spectrum as shown experimentally, however,  given that the idea is rather simple, it is important to show its significance with examples that clearly emphasize the importance of controlling the whole spectrum versus the spectral norm only.\n\n\nRevision: Figure 1 is convincing and hints to why SN-GAN acheives slow decay while in principle it only tries to control the spectral norm. I think this paper is a good contribution as it provides a simple and efficient algorithm to precisely control the spectrum. Moreover, a recent work ([2], theorem 1 ) provides theoretical evidence for the importance of controling the whole spectrum which makes this contribution even more relevant.\n\n\n[1] T. Miyato, T.
