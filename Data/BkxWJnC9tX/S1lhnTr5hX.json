{"title": "Very interesting discourse, but experiments could be more thorough. ", "review": "The major contribution of this work is extending routing networks (Rosenbaum et al., ICLR 2018) to use diverse architectures across routed modules. I view this as an important contribution and am very impressed by the experiment on Omniglot where it shows big performance gain on a split with very few examples. This idea of incorporating in architectural bias and not just parameter bias for small data problems is very compelling and intuitive to me on the surface. The ablation study was also very interesting in this regard. I really like the discourse and found it to be filled with interesting insights throughout ranging from the connection between routing networks and neural architecture search to the heuristic for selecting k.  However, after the great discourse, I was quite disappointed by the breadth of the experiments. \n\nThe paper is positioned as exploring two parallel ideas that are independently interesting 1) diversity in the architecture of modules in routing models 2) the effect of increasing depth in routing models. For the first idea, this is shown very well by the Omniglot experiment but is not evaluated in any other setting. Showing this in a few other experiments would have really driven this point home in my opinion.  The second idea is not really executed in a convincing way to me. The authors call it a \u2018negative result\u2019 in the end, but I\u2019m not sure I really feel like I learned anything from this experiment. I wonder about statistical significance. I also feel like the authors are trying to turn it into a commentary that this is a pain point for all variants of routing models while they only actually tried it for their proposed architecture which makes quite a few decisions along the way. I would have liked to see more model variants and datasets before really feeling like I can make any empirical determinations about the fundamental limitations of all routing models in this regard.  Additionally, if there were such a fundamental scaling limitation, you would imagine that an experiment could be constructed that really highlighted this fact where all routing models do way worse.\n\nIn short, I think there are some really good idea in this paper and vote for acceptance on that basis. Had the authors provided more empirical evidence about architectural diversity, I would have given it a very high score. The analysis of depth is also a very interesting topic, but it could possibly even serve as another paper considering that the current results don\u2019t really come to concrete conclusions for the community. \n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
