{"title": "Simple and effective idea, good experiment design", "review": "This paper proposed to address domain generalization under inter-dependence of domains and classes. It motivates a new regularization term by analyzing an existing work, DAN. It shows that this term can improve the generalization performance when the classes and domains are not independent. Experiments are extensive and supportive. \n\nI do not have many comments about this paper. It was a joy to read. The proposed idea is well motivated. It is simple and seems like effective. Experiments are extensive. \n\nWhile the regularization term is motivated by analyzing DAN, it would be nice to discuss its application to other domain adaptation/generalization methods. What is even better is to show its effectiveness on another method in the experiments.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
