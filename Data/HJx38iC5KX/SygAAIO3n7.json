{"title": "This paper lacks sufficient novelty", "review": "In this paper, the author(s) propose a method, invariant feature learning under optimal classifier constrains (IFLOC), which maintains accuracy while improving domain-invariance. Here is a list of suggestions that will help the author(s) to improve this paper.\n1.The paper explains the necessity and effectiveness of the method from the theoretical and experimental aspects, but the paper does not support the innovation point enough, and the explanation is too simple.\n2.In this paper, Figure3-(b) shows that the classification accuracy of IFLOC-abl method decreases a lot when \u03b3 is taken to 0. Figure3-(c) shows that the domain invariance of IFLOC-abl method becomes significantly worse when \u03b3 is 10. The author(s) should explain the reasons in detail.\n3. The lack of analysis on domain-class dependency of each dataset makes the analysis of experimental results weak.\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
