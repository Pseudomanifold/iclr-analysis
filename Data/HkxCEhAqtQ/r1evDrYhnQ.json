{"title": "theoretically interesting", "review": "The articles adapt the framework developed in Wibisono & al to the (infinite dimensional) setting consisting in carrying out  gradient descent in the space of probability distributions.\n\nPROS:\n- the text is well written, with clear references to the literature and a high-level description of the current state-of-the-art.\n- there is a good balance between mathematical details and high-level descriptions of the methods\n- although I have not been able to check all the details of the proofs, the results appear to be correct.\n\nCONS:\n- while I think that this type of article is interesting, I was really frustrated to discover at the end that the proposed methods either rely on strong Gaussian assumptions, or  \"density estimations\". In other words, no \"practical\" method is really proposed.\n- no comparison with other existing method is provided.\n\n\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
