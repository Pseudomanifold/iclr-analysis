{"title": "Interesting extension of the Bregman Lagrangian framework, but quite expensive", "review": "Summary: This paper introduces a functional extension of the Bregman Lagrangian framework of Wibisono et al. 2016. The basic idea is to define accelerated gradient flows on the space of probability distribution. Because the defined flows include a term depending on the current distribution of the system, which is difficult to compute in general, the authors introduce an interacting particle approximation as a practical numerical approximation. The experiments are a proof-of-concept on simple illustrative toy examples.\n\nQuality: The ideas are generally of high quality, but I think there might some typos (or at least some notation I did not understand). In particular\n- tilde{F} is not defined for Table 1\n- the lyapunov function for the vector column of table one includes a term referring to the functional over rho. I think this is a typo and should be f(x) - f(xmin) instead.\n\nClarity: The paper is generally clear throughout.\n\nOriginality & Significance: The paper is original to my knowledge, and a valuable extension to the interesting literature on the Bregman Lagrangian. The problem of simulating from probability distributions is an important one and this is an interesting connection between that problem and optimization.\n\nPros:\n- An interesting extension that may fuel future study.\n\nCons:\n- This algorithm appears naively to have an O(n^2) complexity per iteration, which is very expensive in terms of the number of particles. Most MCMC algorithms would have only O(n) complexity in the number of particles. This limits its applicability.\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
