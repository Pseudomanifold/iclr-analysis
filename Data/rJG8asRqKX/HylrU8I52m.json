{"title": "Novel modelling framework for well-motivated research problem", "review": "The authors present a novel deep learning representation for jointly modelling longitudinal measurements and dynamic time-to-event analysis where there are competing risks for a given event. The authors incorporate patient-level historical data using an RNN which allows updating of individual-level (i.e. personalized) risk predictions as additional data points are collected. This method (Dynamic-DeepHit) makes no assumptions about the underlying stochastic processes. The authors further evaluate the clinical utility of these methods in terms of interpretability of variable importance and dynamic risk predictions.\nThe work is clearly structured and clearly articulate a well-motivated research problem. It is also extremely well-placed within the historical context of previous work done in survival modelling. The authors have carried out an extensive review of the literature showing the evolution as well as the strengths and weaknesses of these methods.\nMy main concern with this manuscript is the handling of missing data. In the context of this study, the evaluation of missing data was inadequately investigated. This is an important problem within the context of what the authors are trying to achieve. Although it may be outside the scope of the current manuscript, different assumptions regarding missing data should be investigated. For example, if missing data was correlated with a particular outcome or a particular covariate, then replacing missing values with interpolation or with the mean and mode would lead to biased estimates. \n", "rating": "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
