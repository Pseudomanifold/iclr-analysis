{"title": "Interesting proposal without clear contributions", "review": "This paper proposes the use of RL as a set of commands to be included as programming instructions in  common programming languages.  In this aspect, the authors propose to add simple instructions to employ the power of machine learning in general, and reinforcement learning in particular in common programming tasks.\n\nIn this aspect, the authors show with three different examples how the use of RL can speed up the performance of common tasks: binary search, sorting and caches.\n\nThe paper is easy to read and follow. \n\nIn my opinion, the main problem of the paper is that the contributions are not clear. The authors claim that the introduce a new hybrid approach of programming between common programming and ML, however, I do not see many differences between calling APIs and the current proposal. The paper seems to be a wrapper of API calls. Here, the authors should comment existing approaches based on ML and APIs.\n\nThe authors  introduce the examples to show the advantages of using predictive variables. Many of the advantages are based on increasing the performance of the algorithms using these predictive variables, however, the results do not include the computational costs of learning the models. \n\nTherefore, in my opinion the paper should be more focused on detailing the commands of use of predictive variables and emphasising the advantages with respect to existing methods. Currently, the paper gives too relevance to the performance of the experiments, where the novel contributions are not there.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
