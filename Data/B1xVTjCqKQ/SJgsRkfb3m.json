{"title": "A data-driven and distributed approach to sparse signal representation and recovery", "review": "Authors case the problem of finding informative measurements by using a maximum likelihood formulation and show how a data-driven dimensionality reduction protocol is built for sensing signals using convolutional architectures. A novel parallelization scheme is discussed and analyzed for speeding up the signal recovery process.\n \nPrevious works have been proposed to jointly learn the signal sensing and reconstruction algorithm using convolutional networks. Authors do not consider them as the baseline methods due to the fact that the blocky reconstruction approach is unrealistic such as MRI. However, there is no empirical result to support his conclusion.  In addition, the comparisons to these methods can further convince the readers about the advantage of the proposed method.\n \nIt is not clear where the maximum deviation from isometry in Algorithm 1 is discussed since the MSE is used as a loss function.\n \nAuthors provided theoretical insights for the proposed algorithm. It indicates that the lower-bound of the mutual information is maximized and minimizing the mean squared error is a special case, but it is unclear why this can provide theoretical guarantee for the proposed method. More details are good for the connections between the theory and the proposed algorithm.\n \nOne of the contributions in this paper is the speed, so the results on the speed should be put in the main paper.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
