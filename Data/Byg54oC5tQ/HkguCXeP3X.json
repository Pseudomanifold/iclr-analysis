{"title": "application paper with limited interest to ICLR", "review": "This is an application paper making use of GANs to generate images based on an experimental setup in material sciences.\n\nThere is very little methodological novelty and the key contribution seems to be the application-specific formulation of the generative process, which I believe might be of limited interest to the ICLR community.\n\nOverall, the presentation of the paper could be improved. The shown images are too small, low resolution and visually it is hard to see any difference between the different models (Fig 8). The writing also needs to be improved as there are quite a few mistakes.\n\nMy impression is that the authors have not sufficiently covered prior work on image generation in experimental settings. There is a plethora of work on using GANs for image synthesis in computer vision and biological and medical imaging. The claim that \"none of these researchs have built a data-to-image model\" seems odd.\n\nI am also a bit confused about this introduced terminology of the image-to-data and data-to-image models which doesn't seem to be very meaningful.\n\nIn summary, I believe the paper could be of interest to the material sciences community but is not adequate for ICLR.", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
