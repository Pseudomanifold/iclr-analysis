{"title": "Unsupervised disentanglement approach for content transfer", "review": "The paper proposes an unsupervised approach for mapping two sets of objects, A and B, such that set B contains all the information that is in set A and some additional information. The paper learns a latent space which encodes: (a) information which is shared in both sets, and (b) the additional content present in B. This is done by employing a two-pathway encoder and a decoder for both the sets. Experiments on problems such as adding glasses or facial hair to faces shows that the proposed method performs better than existing disentanglement approaches.
