{"title": "Simple idea with potential but experiments are unconvincing", "review": "In the vein of recent work on learning \u201cticking\u201d behaviour for LSTMs such as Phased LSTM, this paper proposes to add additional data independent gates to LSTM units that are defined as Gaussian functions of time indices.\nThe performance of the modified g-LSTM is compared to LSTM on the Addition, sequential MNIST and sequential CIFAR-10 tasks. The authors argue that g-LSTM results in better performance and has faster convergence on these tasks. \n\nAdditionally, it is proposed that one can reduce the amount of computations performed by the network by adding a computation budget term to the optimized loss that encouraged the cells to update less often. Finally, a technique for gradually transitioning from a g-LSTM to an LSTM during training is proposed, with the objective of speeding up training over a regular LSTM.\n\nThe paper is well written and easy to understand in general. However, the main results of this paper are experimental, and I am not entirely convinced by the experiments that g-LSTM is an improvement over the LSTM baseline for certain scenarios.\n\nOne broad reason for my doubts is that the comparisons don\u2019t seem to utilise proper hyperparameter tuning for the baseline LSTM. Network sizes, learning rates, decay schedules, initialisations etc. all appear to be fixed, so one can not be sure of the \u201creal\u201d performance or convergence behavior of the models. Biased gate initializations are not used, though they have been used successfully in past work to aid in long term memory.\n\nI should note that for long term memory problems such as those proposed by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber (1997), the proposed LSTM did not use a forget gate (or even BPTT) and used biased gate initialisations. However, these features are useful for more realistic tasks, and popular LSTM designs are biased towards them instead of toy problems.\n\nI would consider the addition problem and sequential MNIST and CIFAR-10 to be interesting and difficult toy tasks for initial validation of ideas (and more extensive hyperparameter searches). It is unclear if the proposed techniques will perform provide  improvements over a well-tuned baseline for some realistic tasks, or are they suitable only for toy problems.
