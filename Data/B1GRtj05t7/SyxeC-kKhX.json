{"title": "This paper is missing key related literature, and thus the significance of the contributions is not clear.", "review": "The paper proposes a notion of spatial decomposition of the value function, whereby the Q-function is a linear combination of rewards and discounted visiting frequency.  This seems to be analogous to the successor feature representation (Barreto et al. 2017).  Unfortunately the authors seem to be unaware of this work.  In general, the Related Works section is insufficient, and many other related work on spatial regularization in RL is also missing (from fitted Q-iteration, to work by Ghavamzadeh et al.).  I encourage the authors to thoroughly consult this literature, to better position their contributions.\n\nOther comments:\nThe experiments currently in the paper are not fully convincing; only 5 random seeds were used yet mujoco can be quite noisy. The results don't seem statistically significant.  I also suspect there\u2019s some cherry picking; some hyper-parameter are used for some game and different one for other game.\n\n(I had a colleague independently review the paper, and he pointed out exactly the same major issue.)\n\n", "rating": "2: Strong rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
