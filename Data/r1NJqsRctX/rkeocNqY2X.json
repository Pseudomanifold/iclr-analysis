For instance, I believe you can create a unique section with title \" Choice of Proposal density \" and then schematically describe each proposal from the simplest to the more sophisticated one.\n\n- At the beginning of Section 2, please devote more sentence to explain why extending the space and apply the variational inference is good for finding a suitable good proposal density.\n\n- Related  to Section 2 ( theMixture Proposal MCMC contribution), the authors should discuss (in the introduction and also in the related works section) the Multiple Try Metropolis schemes with correlated candidates where, for instance, a path of candidates is generated and one of them is selected and tested with MH-type acceptance probability, in a proper way. This is more general that your scheme but very related. Please see\n\nQin, Z.S., Liu, J.S., 2001. Multi-point Metropolis method with application to hybrid Monte Carlo.

If I have properly understood, you also adapt a mixture via variational inference. Please, in Section 4, consider the different works that considers an adapting mixture proposal for a  Metropolis-type algorithm,\n\nP. Giordani and R.
