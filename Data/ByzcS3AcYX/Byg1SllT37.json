{"title": "Review of \u201cTTS-GAN: A GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORK FOR STYLE MODELING IN A TEXT-TO-SPEECH SYSTEM\u201d", "review": "This paper proposes to use a generative adversarial network to model speaking style in end-to-end TTS. The paper shows the effectiveness of the proposed method compared with Takotron2 and other variants of end-to-end TTS with intensive experimental verifications. The proposed method of using adversarial and collaborative games is also quite unique. The experimental part of the paper is well written, but the formulation part is difficult to follow. Also, the method seems to be very complicated, and I\u2019m concerning about the reproducibility of the method only with the description in Section 3.\n\nComments\n- Page 2, line 2: x _{aud} ^{+} -> x _{aud} ^{-} (?)\n- Section 2: $T$ is used for audio and the number of words.\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
