{"title": "Good paper, very well written", "review": "This paper proposed an approximation technique to learn the large-scale graph with the desired edge density. It was well-written and contains thorough experimental results and analysis.\n\nA minor drawback is that while this work was motivated by the use of k-NN graph in graph convolution network (GCN), there was no evidence on how well A-NN performs in compare to k-NN with GCN.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
