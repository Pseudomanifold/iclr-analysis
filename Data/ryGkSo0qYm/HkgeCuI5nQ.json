{"title": "marginally bellow threshold", "review": "The paper proposes a scalable approximate calculation of graph construction. Based on the sparse optimization formulation of a graph construction, the authors provide a way to select parameter automatically based on user desired connectivity of graph.\n\nThe problem setting, graph construction, is significant for the wide range of ML community. Overall, however, advantage/novelty of the proposed method is unclear for me.\n\nScalability is main advantage of the proposed method, but the authors just employed known nearest neighbor approximation methods, and thus here no technical novelty is shown.\n\nI couldn't find connection between Section 3 and 4, these seem to be an independent topics. Main claim of the paper would be in Section 3, but the novelty would be weak as mentioned above.\n\nSolving reverse problem is interesting, but it just provide the parameter value range which results in given sparsity level k. This doesn't provide exact value of \\theta (and user still have to specify k), and selection would be possible easily without the analytical formula (e.g., by following the regularization path)\n\nPerformance verification is not convincing. Showing accuracy gain for more wide variety of datasets would be convincing.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
