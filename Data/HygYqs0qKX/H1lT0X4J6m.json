{"title": "The authors propose a method to improve object detection accuracy at inference time without re-training, changing network architecture, and working for both one-shot and two-stages detectors.", "review": "The goal of the paper clearly motivated and well described. However, the notations and figures are more complicated than necessary; hence, it is a bit hard to follow the paper in detail. There are also some missing related works about domain adaptation for object detectors. For instance,\nChen et al. \"Domain Adaptive Faster R-CNN for Object Detection in the Wild\" In CVPR 2018.\nInoue et al. \"Cross-Domain Weakly-Supervised Object Detection through Progressive Domain Adaptation\" In CVPR 2018.\nThe authors should cite these papers and compare with their performance.\nFinally, the proposed method doesn't consistently improve the detection accuracy. \nThe proposed method also slows down the frame rate of the detector due to multiple iterations of feedforward/feedback inferences.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
