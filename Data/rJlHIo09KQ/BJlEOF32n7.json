{"title": "Gradient-based SFA", "review": "In this paper the authors present a differentiable objective for slow feature analysis, to facilitate end-to-end training.   I am not clear on the novelty of this formulation, as it appears to have been proposed in a similar form in previous works (e.g., A maximum-likelihood interpretation for slow feature analysis by Turner and Sahani - Eq., (2)) and can probably be considered straightforward.  Nevertheless, the approximate whitening layer and the way it is used is a smart approach for this problem.  The experiments are interesting and shed light on the properties of the method.  In summary, the paper may lack technical novelty in some respect, but the experiments are convincing in terms of proof-of-concept, and the approach is smart.\n\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
