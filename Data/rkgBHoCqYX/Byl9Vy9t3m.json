{"title": "A kernel matrix-based algorithm for PCA", "review": "This paper proposes an algorithm to approximate kernel matrix based on the Taylor expansion of the element-wise functions. The authors provide a spectral norm based error bound for their method and the corresponding results for the special case, \\epsilon-sparse matrix.\n\nI have some comment as follow.\n\n1. Can you provide some comparison with Nystrom methods? It is very popular for kernel approximation and looks more efficient than the proposed algorithm. \n\n2. The analysis relies on the Gaussian assumption on the input matrix. Can we extend it to more general case?\n\n3. In section 5, the paper said \u201cas our method consists in computing the sparse eigenvectors of a p \\times p matrix which can be done by power method, the complexity of estimating the principal component is about O(ps) where s is the sparsity level\u201d. The time complexity of the proposed algorithm is not clearly.\na) Is there any bound for the sparsity level s? Why the eigenvectors of p \\times p matrix is sparse?\nb) The convergence of power method is heavily affected by the eigen-gap of the matrix. Is there any theoretical or empirical result for the convergence behavior of power method on approximate matrix and original matrix?\n\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
