{"title": "More of a software document than a scientific paper!", "review": "This paper introduces Geomstats, a geometric toolbox for machine learning on Riemannian manifolds. In comparison to previous packages such as manopt and pymanopt, the paper claims that the proposed software provide more efficient implementations, and is integrated with deep learning backends. Several potential applications settings for the software are explored, introducing some performance gains on specific problems when one resorts to the geometry of the space. An example setting for deep learning on SE(3) is also presented.\n\nStrengths: The use of such a toolbox could be a significant step to leveraging geometric models in deep learning.\n\nWeakness: \n\n1. The paper is written as more of a software document than a scientific paper. Several well-known manifolds are presented in the setting of Geomstats, however what is lacking is a treatment of some of the internals of how backpropagation can be implemented effectively for such a toolbox. For example, many of the Riemannian geometric algorithms need to resort to numerical algorithms such as SVD and such; how effective or feasible is automatic differentiation in dealing with such cases? \n\n2. The paper discusses computational advantages in the introduction -- however such advantages are not quantitatively analyzed across different platforms or prior softwares. \n\nOverall, it is not clear why this work needs to be treated as a scientific paper? It appears to be more of a tutorial on the use of the proposed software.", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
