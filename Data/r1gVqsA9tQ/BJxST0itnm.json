{"title": "interesting idea, insufficiently fleshed out", "review": "The authors propose `ChainGAN, a GAN architecture where the generator is supplemented with a series of editors that iteratively improve image quality. In practice, the algorithm also uses multiple critics (discriminators), although this is not explained until the Experiments section. \n\nThe paper contains the germ of a powerful idea. However, it feels as if the authors haven't yet come to grip with their own idea and architecture. Currently, the role of the editors feels underspecified: it is unclear (and unexplored?) what architectures make for good editors; exactly how editors should interact with the various losses; and what the role of the critics (ideas are proposed in related work) should be. In the experiments, the editors sharpen image quality, but the tradeoffs are not explored. Are more editors always better? When does it saturate? Why? Adding a few editors and critics makes the architecture more parameter-efficient, but increases the number of losses. What happens to wall-clock training time? Moreover, the paper is conflicted about the role of the critic(s). Is the core idea to have multiple generators, discriminators, or both? What is moving the needle? \n\n\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
