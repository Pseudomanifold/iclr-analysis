{"title": "a dynamical systems analysis of 1d and 2d gated recurrent units", "review": "This paper analyzes GRUs from a dynamical systems perspective, i.e. phase diagrams, fixed points, and bifurcations. The abstract and intro are well written and motivate the need for more theoretical framework to understand RNNs, especially how well they are able to represent and express temporal features in the training data. The dynamical systems analysis is well presented and visualized nicely. \n\nMost of the paper concentrates on the 1d (one single GRU) and 2d (two GRU's) case.  They show that 2d GRUs can be trained to adopt a variety of fixed points, can approximate a line attractors (an important feature for short-term memory), but cannot mimic a ring attractor.\n\nMy concerns are:\n\n- The derivation of the continuous time dynamical system (Appendix A) is confusing to me. Unless I'm not following the derivation correctly, should there be another \\Delta t in the denominator of the right-hand side of (23), from (22)? It's confusing to me that the continuous-time version in (26) has essentially the same form as the discrete-time version in (22).\n\n- The applicability of this analysis to RNNs of even modest size is unclear. Generically, there's no reason to believe the intuitions from 2d should necessarily generalize to higher dimensions, and rigorous analysis of higher dimensional systems of this kind can be fairly challenging, even if one starts from a continuation analysis.\n\n- Small typo: top of Page 4, figure should refer to 3A, not 2A.\n\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
