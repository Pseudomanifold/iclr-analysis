{"title": "#Summary", "review": "This paper proposes two gated deep learning architectures for sensor fusion. They are all based on the previous work \nNaman Patel et al's modality fusion with CNNs for UGV autonomous driving in indoor environments (IROS). By having the grouped features, the author demonstrated improved performance, especially in the presence of random sensor noise and failures.\n\n#Organization/Style:\nThe paper is well written, organized, and clear on most points. A few minor points:\n1) The total length of the paper exceeds 8 pages. Some figures and tables should be adjusted to have it fit into 8 pages.\n2) The literature review is limited.\n3) There are clearly some misspellings. For example, the \"netgated\" is often written as \"negated\".\n\n#Technical Accuracy:\nThe two architecture that the author proposes all based on the grouped features, which to my point of view, is a very important and necessary part of the new model. However, the author failed to rigorously prove or clearly demonstrated that why this is effective to our new model.  Moreover, how to make groups or how many groups are needed are not clearly specified. The experiments used only two completely different datasets, none of them are related to the previous sensor fusion method they are trying to compete. I'm afraid this method cannot generalize to a common case.\n\nIn addition, if we look at Table 4 and Table 5, we can find the first Group-level Fusion Weight actually increases, which seems contradictory to the result shown in Table 6.\n\n#Adequacy of Citations: \nPoor coverage of literature in sensor fusion. There are less than 10 references are related to sensor fusion.\n\nOverall, it is not an ICLR standard paper.", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
