{"title": "I'm not convinced by the main assumption, it still needs more work to get published.", "review": "This paper has proposed a new algorithm for semi-supervised learning, which incorporate biased negative data into the existing PU learning framework.\n\nThe paper was written in clarity and easy to follow overall. However, the original motivation for having biased negative data are not explained very clear. The relation to dataset shift was very interesting, but it\u2019s unclear what\u2019s the exact connection between the proposed algorithm and the dataset shift. Maybe the authors can elaborate a little more on their point here in the future revision.\n\nThe paper has made some assumption about the relation between the latent random variable and the label in section 2.4. In the experiment, data sets are generated following the exact assumption. That\u2019s not surprising to see that the proposed algorithm that fits the assumption will perform better than the previous methods without this assumption. In practice, there\u2019s no way to really verify this assumption. Thus, it\u2019s more interesting to see how the algorithm performs under the more generic semi-supervised learning setting, with unbiased, or biased negatives that don\u2019t really fit the exact assumption in this paper.\n\nMoreover, I\u2019d like to see more intuition on why adding biased negative data will further improve upon nnPNU. The author provided some explanation in section 4.3, which seems just observations on the FPR and FNR, rather than the fundamental explanation for the advantage of this algorithm.\n\nChoice of baseline methods is also limited. The original paper [1] for PNU has included a bunch of benchmark algorithms for semi-supervised learning. The authors should also include more benchmark algorithms for comparison, e.g. those listed in Section 5.2 in [1].\n\n[1] Sakai, Tomoya, et al. \"Semi-supervised classification based on classification from positive and unlabeled data.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1605.06955 (2016).", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
