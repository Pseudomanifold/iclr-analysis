{"title": "Simple approach that works", "review": "This paper considers normalization by learning to average across well-known normalization techniques.\nThis meta-procedure almost by definition can yield better results, and this is demonstrated nicely by the authors.\nThe idea is simple and easy to implement, and easy works in this case.\n\nI would like to hear more about the connections to other meta-learning procedures, by expanding the discussion on page 3.\nThat discussion is very interesting but quite short, and I am afraid I can't see how SN avoids overfitting compared to other approaches. \nAlso, the section on Inference in page 4 is unclear to me. What parameters are being inferred and why is the discussion focused on convergence instead?", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
