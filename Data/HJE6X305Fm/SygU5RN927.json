{"title": "robustness regularization improves GANs training", "review": "The paper proposed a systematic way of training GANs with robustness regularization terms. Using the proposed method, training GANs is smoother and  \n\npros\n- The paper is solving an important problem of training GANs in a robust manner. The idea of designing regularization terms is also explored in other domains of computer vision research, and it's nice to see the its power in training GANs.\n- The paper provides detailed proofs and analysis of the approach, and visualizations of the regularization term help people to understand the ideas.\n- The presentation of the approach makes sense, and experimental results using several different GANs methods and competing regularization methods are extensive and good in general\n\ncons\n- I didn't find major issues of the paper. I think code in the paper should be made public as it could potentially be very useful for training GANs in general.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
