{"title": "Good paper with good results", "review": "The main idea that this paper presents is that making a discriminator robust to adversarial perturbations the GAN objective can be made smooth which results in better results both visually and in terms of FID. In addition to the  proposed adversarial regularisation the authors also propose a much stronger regularisation called robust feature matching which uses the features of the second last layer of the discriminator. I find the ideas presented in this paper interesting and novel.\nThe authors' claims are supported with sufficient theory and several experiments that prove their claims. The presented results show consistent improvements in terms of FID and actually some of the improvements reported are impressive", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
