{"title": "A representation learning method for time series data", "review": "This paper proposes a deep learning method for representation learning in time series data. The goal is to learn a discrete two-dimensional representation of the time series data in an interpretable manner. The model is constructed on the basis of self-organizing maps (SOM) and involves reconstruction error in the training. In order to address the non-differentiability in the discrete representation assignment, the authors propose to include an extra reconstruction loss term w.r.t. the discrete representation. The authors conduct experiments on both static and time series data and validate that the method perform better than related methods in terms of clustering results as well as interpretability.\n\nThis paper deals with an interesting problem as learning an interpretable representation in time series data is important in areas such as health care and business. However, I am afraid the presentation of this paper is a bit difficult to follow. Some concerns/questions as below:\n\n1) As the paper is based on SOM, some illustration of this method would be helpful for readers to understand the idea and learn the major contribution;\n\n2) The authors use NMI and purity to evaluate the clustering performance. I was curious why not use the clustering accuracy as well?\n\n3) Some more explanation on Fig. 4(d) would be helpful.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}
