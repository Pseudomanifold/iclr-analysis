{"title": "This paper proposes a new method for producing saliency maps and my main concerned is the objective evaluation. ", "review": "This paper studies how to better visually interpret a deep neural network. It proposes a new method to produce less noisy saliency maps, named RectGrad. RectGrad thresholds gradient during backprop in a layer-wise fashion in a similar manner to a previous work called Guided Backprop. The difference is that Guided Backprop employs a constant threshold, i.e. 0, while RectGrad uses an adaptive threshold based on a percentile hyper-parameter. The paper is well-written, including a comprehensive review of previous related works, an meaningful meta-level discussion for motivation, and a clear explanation of the proposed method. \n\nOne of my biggest concern is regarding the experiment and evaluation section. Conclusions are drawn based on the visualization of a few saliency maps. I am not sure how much I can trust these conclusions as the conclusions are drawn in a handy-wavy manner the examples are prone to cherry-picking and . For example, this is the conclusion in the Adversarial Attack paragraph: \u201cwe can conclude that Rectified Gradient is  equally or more class sensitive than baseline attribution methods\u201d. As pointed out by the paper, the conclusion can be drawn from Figure 8 in the main paper and Figure 10 in Appendix A.1. However, the proposed method tends to produce a saliency map with higher sparsity, therefore the difference may appear more apparent. It is stretching to conclude that it is more class sensitive without further quantitative validation. \n\nEvaluation appears to be a common concern to the work on saliency maps.  The existing quantitative evaluation in the paper seems disconnected to the visual nature of saliency maps. Concretely, when can we say one saliency map looks better than another? Since this paper claims to produce less noisy saliency maps, what does it mean quantitatively? Is it true that it produces less pixels on the background? If so, can we evaluate it with foreground-background segmentation annotation to prove that point? Though how to evaluate saliency maps remains an open question, I feel some discussion on this paper would make the paper more insightful.
