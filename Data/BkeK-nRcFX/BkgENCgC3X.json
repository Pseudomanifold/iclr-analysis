{"title": "An interesting proposal lacking justification.", "review": "In this paper the authors introduce a new quantity, the nonlinearity coefficient, and argue that its value at initialization is a useful predictor of test time performance for neural networks. The authors conduct a wide range of experiments over many different network architectures and activation functions to corroborate these results. The authors then extend their method to compute the local nonlinearity of activation functions instead.\n\nI am a bit torn on this paper. I appreciate the direction that the authors have chosen to pursue. The topic of identifying parameters that are predictive of trainability is certainly interesting and has the potential to be quite impactful. Moreover, the breadth of the experiments conducted by the authors is novel and significant. Finally, I find the the overall manner in which the authors have chosen to present their data refreshingly transparent. Together, this leads me to believe that the quantity proposed by the authors might be useful to researchers.\n\nHaving said that, I am concerned by the author\u2019s exposition of the nonlinearity coefficient itself. Fundamentally, my concern stems from the fact that it seems a lot of relatively ad-hoc decisions were made in the construction of the nonlinearity coefficient and an insufficiently good job was done to compare it to other measures of nonlinearity.\n\nSpecifically, it feels like an extremely weak definition of nonlinearity to say that the linear approximation of a function fails when it produces values that lie outside of the co-domain of the function. Moreover, I feel as though there is already a well defined notion of nonlinearity at a point that could be constructed by reference to the Hessian (or generally by the approximation error induced by truncating the Taylor series after the linear term). I would like to see some comparison between these two methods. \n\nThis is made more troubling given that the correlation found by the authors is present but does not seem especially strong. For example, in fig. 2A it seems like the nonlinearity coefficient varies by at least two orders of magnitude in the inset of the figure where the test accuracy really does not seem sensitive to its value. Prior work (for example, [1] from last years ICLR) has shown strong correlations between the Frobenius norm of the Jacobian and test error (see fig. 5 and fig. 6). Since the definition of the nonlinearity coefficient seems somewhat ad-hoc I would love to see a comparison between it and just looking at the Jacobian norm in terms of predicting test accuracy.\n\n[1] - SENSITIVITY AND GENERALIZATION IN NEURAL NETWORKS: AN EMPIRICAL STUDY\nRoman Novak, Yasaman Bahri, Daniel A.
