{"title": "Simple and working idea, insufficient evaluations", "review": "This is an interesting paper with simple idea and good results. I like the fact that the authors adopt simple autoencoder-like models instead of GANs or RL.\nFollowing are a couple questions that I am concerned about:\n1. Is the ordering of strokes important at all? I suspect that a drawer model that outputs 10 strokes in one pass could perform the same. It might be unnecessary to learn an RNN in this context. Can the authors comment on this?\n2. Quantitative evaluations are not well-presented. In Table 1 and Table 2, it is better to normalize pixel wise loss so that the readers could understand the actual error on each pixel.\n3. Section 4.3 and 4.4 do not have any quantitative evaluations.\n4. How does this system compare with other works, like GANs or RL? Quantitative comparisons are preferred.\n\nThe limitation of the proposed approach is also clear: first it is limited to one kind of curves (like a primitive shape in graphics); second it does not learn when to stop, which is already mentioned in the discussion.\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
