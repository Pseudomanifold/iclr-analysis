{"title": "Need clarification on the experimental setting", "review": "This paper proposes to binarize all parameters of a CNN where the binary parameters are generated from another policy neural network (let's call it parameter generator). The parameter generator network has a special nested structure to regularize parameters within layers and filters. All parameters in CNN and parameter generator network are jointly trained. Since the gradient is hard to back propagated through binary variables, the paper adopts reinforcement learning approach to back-propagate rewards to the parameter generator. \n\nThe experiments look solid. The results show that the proposed approach is slightly worse than BinaryConnect (baseline) on MINST, CIFAR10 and CIFAR100, but outperforms BinaryConnect on ImageNet by a large margin. The ablation study also verified the need for the proposed nested parameter structure.\n\nThe paper is well written. The proposed method (1) is able to provide the posterior distribution of parameters so that we can use that in other applications such as confidence estimation and model selection (2) is memory and power efficient due to binarization. \n\nHaving said that, the experimental setting falls short. For the proposed method, the paper samples 100 binary networks from the parameter generator and pick the best one, which seems not correct. The results of the proposed method should be based on the average of these 100 binary networks, rather than picking the best one, because we won't be able to know which binary network is the best. Using the best one seems label leakage to me. For now, I'll give the benefit of doubt. Please clarify this during the feedback phase.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
