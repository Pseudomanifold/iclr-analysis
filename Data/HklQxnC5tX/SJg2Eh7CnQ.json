{"title": "Application of GNN to overlapping community detection", "review": "The current paper considers the overlapping community detection problem and suggests to use the so-called graph neural networks for its solution.\n\nThe approach starts from BigCLAM model and suggests to parametrize factor matrices (or embedding vectors) via neural network with graph adjacency matrix and node attributes as inputs. The obtained algorithm is tested on several datasets and its reported performance is superior to competitors.\n\nThis paper basically tries to introduce the dependence between embedding vectors for graph nodes, which recently became de facto standard approach in machine learning for graphs. The paper is very well aligned with recent literature on ML for graphs, which is focused on combining different ideas of deep learning, tailoring them to particular graph problem and reporting results on some datasets. Unfortunately, very rarely interesting new ideas appear in these papers, and current paper is not an exception.\n\nI apologize for such a pessimistic view, but I don't see the results significantly interesting for the ICLR community and don't recommend acceptance. Some additional algorithmic/computational/theoretical insights are needed.\n\nI have couple of minor issues to discuss:\n1. For the sake of generality, I would recommend to use the general formula instead of particular 3-layer case in equation 3.\n2. I don't think that it is really appropriate to call 3-layer model a 'deep learning model', I would recommend to just name it 'neural network'\n\nAlso, I think that experimentally paper is pretty strong, but it would be nice to see the repository with algorithm code and experiments available.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
