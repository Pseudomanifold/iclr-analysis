{"title": "Interesting but there are some technical details missing", "review": "The author introduces a simple stochastic algorithm (h-detach) that is specific to LSTM optimization and targeted towards addressing this problem. Specifically, the authors show that when the LSTM weights are large, the gradient components through the linear path (cell state) in the LSTM computational graph get suppressed. Based on the hypothesis that these components carry information about long term dependencies (which we show empirically), their suppression can prevent the LSTM from capturing them. Our algorithm prevents the gradients flowing through this path from getting suppressed, thus allowing the LSTM to capture such dependencies better. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm appears to be effective. Some detailed comments are listed as follows, \n\n1 The h-detach algorithm seems to be the dropout technology. However, the authors did not discuss the relation or difference between the proposed h-detach algorithm and the dropout technology. \n\n2 The proposed method can transfer the positive knowledge. However, for the transfer learning, one concerned and important issue is that some negative knowledge information can be also transferred. So how to avoid the negative transferring? Some necessary discussions about this should be given in the manuscript.\n\n2 There are many grammar errors in the current manuscript. The authors are suggested to improve the English writing.\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
