{"title": "Deep Learning 3D Shapes Using Alt-az Anisotropic 2-Sphere Convolution", "review": "# Weaknesses\nApplications are a bit unclear.\nIt would be nice to see a better case made for spherical convolutions within the experimental section.  The experiments on SHREC17 show all three spherical methods under-performing other approaches.  It leaves it unclear to the reader when someone should choose to utilize a spherical method or when the proposed method would then be preferred compared to other spherical methods.  Is there a task that this representation significantly outperforms other spherical methods and non-spherical methods?  Or a specific useful application where spherical methods in general outperform other approaches?  \n\n# Strengths:\nThe method is well developed and explained.  \nAbility to implement in a straight-forward manner on GPU.\n", "rating": "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
