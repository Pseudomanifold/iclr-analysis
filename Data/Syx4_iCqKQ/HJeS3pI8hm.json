{"title": "Interesting idea but need more convincing experiments", "review": "This paper proposes a unified framework for both classification and regression and a combination of both using pre-designed prototypes distributed on a hypersphere with max separation. It is nice to see an alternative to the dominant cross-entropy loss and l2 loss for deep classification and regression respectively, also the ability to tackle both in a shared output space is a plus. However, the experiments are limited and not convincing that the proposed framework offers a genuine alternatives to existing formulations. \n\nPros:\n\n\u2022\tThe over idea appears to novel, despite its connections to various previous attempts to angular separation (Hasnat et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2017a; Wang et al., 2018; Zheng et al., 2018).\n\u2022\tIt is nice to see a framework that can perform classification/regression multi-task learning. Many computer vision problems have this nature, e.g. object recognition and pose estimation; face recognition and age estimation. So addressing both problems jointly can potentially bring in mutual benefits.  \n\nCons:\n\n\u2022\tThe experiments on CIFAR 10/100 seems to be at par with a conventional cross-entropy loss. It would be more convincing if more experiments on other more challenging datasets (e.g. ImageNet) using more powerfully backbone networks (e.g. densenet) can be provided.\n\u2022\tIn the CIFAR experiments the hypersphere space dimension is set to the same as the number of classes. In this case, why not just use a one-hot vector to represent each class, and do L2 normalization to the output of the feature extraction network and then do softmax cross-entropy? As pointed out in Section 4, several works project network outputs to the hypersphere for classification through L2 normalization, which forces softmax cross-entropy to optimize for angular separation (Hasnat et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2017a; Wang et al., 2018; Zheng et al., 2018). These works should be compared here to convince the readers why it is necessary to use evolutionary algorithm or Monto-Carlo sampling to set the prototypes rather than just using one-hot vectors. \n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
