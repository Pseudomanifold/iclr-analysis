{"title": "Interesting bridge paper between knowledge-based and learning approaches with good synergy", "review": "I am familiar with the few-shot learning literature and this particular approach is novel as far as I know. A weight generator outputs the last layer of an otherwise pre-trained model. A combination of attention over base category weights and graph neural networks is used to parametrize the generator. Results are particularly good on 1-shot miniImageNet classification, but may not be entirely comparable with previous work. Two more interesting experiments are given and have convincingly superior results (at first glance) but I am not familiar with those domains. \n\nI still think the questions in my previous post need answers! I am willing to improve my score if clarifications are added to the paper.\n\nOverall, the paper makes a convincing point that hand-engineered graphs and knowledge can be effectively used with learning methods, even in challenging few-shot settings.\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
