{"title": "review", "review": "This paper studies the problem of compactly represent the model of a complex dynamic system while preserving information. The method is based on the information bottleneck method. Basically, for a dynamic system whose states changing from X_{k-1}, X_k to X_{k+1}, the \"information bottleneck hierarchy\" method learns a variable B_k and B_{k+1} such that B_k predicts B_{k+1} well, B_k predicts X_k well, and B_{k+1} predicts X_{k+1} well, while minimizing the information of X_{k-1} contained in B_k. \n\nIn my opinion, this is a very interesting framework for representing and learning a dynamic system. The paper then considers simple examples on a linear model with Gaussian noise and show that the IBH method performs better than the one-BN method. The simulation and the experiments on real data all show very good performance (even with the simple linear Gaussian estimator).\n\nThe reason that I give such a rating is that of the confusing writing.\n* In the abstract, it is unclear what the goal is. For example, the second and third sentence do not explain the first sentence: \"the task is a crucial task\".\n* Introduction is also very confusing. It seems there is not a good logic connecting each sentence.\n* The paper does not give a good survey of other methods performing similar tasks, e.g., the ones the paper are comparing to in the experiment section. Therefore, it is hard to compare or to understand why the previous methods are worse.\n* Figure 2: one-BN is not well defined. How do you design the IB locally? \n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
