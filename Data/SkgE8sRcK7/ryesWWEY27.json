{"title": "Contributions of this paper are unclear and not well evaluated", "review": "The main difficulty of neuroevolution---requiring a huge number of simulations for high dimensional problem---is addressed in this paper by introducing VAE to reduce the state space dimensionality and using a rather shallow controller network. This idea itself is very promising, however, it has been introduced in (Ha and Schmidhuber, 2018).  Still, there seems to be differences in how to gather histories and how to use them. Nevertheless, the differences are not well described in the text. The effect of the modification is not evaluated on experiments.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
