{"title": "comparison with faster algorithms for sampling from DPPs", "review": "Determinantal Point Processes provide an efficient and elegant way to sample a subset of diverse items from a ground set. This has found applications in summarization, matrix approximation, minibatch selection. However, the naive algorithm for DPP takes time O(N^3), where N is the size of the ground set. The authors provide an alternative model DPPNet for sampling diverse items that preserves the elegant mathematical properties (closure under conditioning, log-submodularity) of DPPs while having faster sampling algorithms.\n\nThe authors need to compare the performance of DPPNet against faster alternatives to sample from DPPs, e.g., https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.01618.pdf, as well as compare on applications where there is a significant gap between uniform sampling and DPPs (because there are the applications where DPPs are crucial). The examples in Table 2 and Table 3 do not address this.", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
