{"title": "Nice idea, not sure it generalizes to other tasks", "review": "The method proposes to use physiological signals to improve performance of reinforcement learning algorithms. By measuring heart pulse amplitude the authors build an intrinsic reward function that is less sparse that the extrinsic one. It helps to be risk averse and allows getting better performances than the vanilla RL algorithm on a car-driving task. \n\nI found the paper well written and the idea is quite nice. I like the idea that risk aversion is processed as a data-driven problem and not as an optimisation problem or using heuristics. I think this general idea could be pushed further in other cases (like encourage fun, surprise, happiness etc. ). \n\nThere are some issues with this paper yet. First, modifying the reward function also modifies the optimal policy. In the specific case of car driving, it may not be bad to modify the policy so that it makes passenger less stressed but in general, it is not good. This is why most of works based on intrinsic motivation also schedule the lambda parameter to decrease with time. This is not something explored in this paper. Also, this work is well suited to the car-driving scenario because stress is closely related to risk and accident. But it may not work with other applications. I would thus suggest that the title of the paper reflects the specific case of risk aversion.
