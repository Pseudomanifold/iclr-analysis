{"title": "A decent pruning strategy.", "review": "The paper proposes to prune convolutional networks by analyzing the observed correlation between the filters of a same layer as expressed by the eigenvalue spectrum of their covariance matrix. The authors propose two strategies to decide of a compression level, one based on an eigenvalue threshold, the other one based on a heuristic based on the KL divergence between the observed eigenvalue distribution and the uniform one. This is a bit bizarre but does not require searching a parameter. Once one has decided the number of filters to keep, one can either retrain the network from scratch, or iteratively remove the most correlated filters, which, unsurprisingly, work better.\n\nThe authors perform credible experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 that show the results one would expect. They should probably have run ImageNet experiments because many earlier papers on this topic use it as a benchmark and because the ImageNet size often reveals different behaviors.\n\nIn conclusion, this is a very decent paper, but not a very exciting one.\n\n-------------\n\nAfter reading the authors' response and their additional experiments, I still see this work as a very decent paper, but not a very exciting one. This is why I rank this paper somewhat above the acceptance threshold. I could be proven wrong if this approach becomes the method of choice to prune networks, but I would need to see a lot more comparisons to be convinced. \n\n \n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
