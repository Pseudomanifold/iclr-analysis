{"title": "Interesting work and analysis", "review": "I really enjoyed reading the paper! The exposition is clear with interesting observations, and most importantly, the authors walk the extra mile in doing a theoretical analysis of the observed phenomena.\n\nQuestions for the authors:\n1. (Also AREA CHAIR NOTE): Another parallel submission to ICLR titled \u201cGenerative Ensembles for Robust Anomaly Detection\u201d makes similar observations and seemed to suggest that ensembling can help counter the observed CIFAR/SVHN phenomena unlike what we see in Figure 10. Their criteria also accounts for the variance in model log-likelihoods and is hence slightly different.\n2. Even though Figure 2b shows that SVHN test likelihoods are higher than CIFAR test likelihoods, the overlap in the histograms of CIFAR-train and CIFAR-test is much higher than the overlap in CIFAR-train and SVHN-test. If we define both maximum and minimum thresholds based on the CIFAR-train histogram, it seems like one could detect most SVHN samples just by the virtue that there likelihoods are much higher than even the max threshold determined by the CIFAR-train histogram?\n3. Why does the constant image (all zeros) in Figure 9 (appendix) have such a high likelihood? It\u2019s mean (=0 trivially) is clearly different from the means of the CIFAR-10 images (Figure 6a) so the second order analysis of Section 5 doesn\u2019t seem applicable.\n4. How much of this phenomena do you think is characteristic for images specifically? Would be interesting to test anomaly detection using deep generative models trained on modalities other than images.\n5. One of the anonymous comments on OpenReview is very interesting: samples from a CIFAR model look nothing like SVHN. This seems to call the validity of the anomalous into question. Curious what the authors have to say about this.\n\nMinor nitpick: There seems to be some space crunching going on via Latex margin and spacing hacks that the authors should ideally avoid :)", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
