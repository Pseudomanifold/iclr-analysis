{"title": "Interesting technical contribution", "review": "This paper proposes a method for adversarial attacks on DNNs (StrAttack), designed to exploit the underlying structure of the images. Specifically, incorporating group-sparsity regularization into the generation of the adversarial samples and using an ADMM based implementation to generate the adversarial perturbations.\n\nThe paper is structured and written well, with clear articulation of technical details. The experiments and reported results are comprehensive, and clearly showcase the efficacy of the proposed solution.  I'm not enough of an expert on the subject matter to comment about the novelty of this proposed approach. However, it would help to elaborate more on the related work (section.7) with clear contrasting of current method esp. using structural information for adversarial samples - theoretical implications, underlying rationale and importantly calling out the benefit over the previous lp - norm based approaches?\n\nRegarding group sparsity - it is unclear as to the assumed structural constraints, is the sliding mask expected to be only 2x2, 13x13 (for MNIST/CIFAR-10, ImageNET respectively) ? impact of larger/smaller or skewed sizes ? sensitivity to image types?\n\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}
