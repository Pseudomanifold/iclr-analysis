{"title": "the paper has good technical qualities, but motivation for the research is not explained", "review": "The paper proposes a method to find adversarial examples in which the changes are localized to small regions of the image. A group-sparsity objective is introduced for this purpose and it is combined with an l_p objective that was used in prior work to define proximity to the original example. ADMM is applied to maximize the defined objective. It is shown that adversarial examples in which all changes are concentrated in just few regions can be found with the proposed method.\n\nThe paper is clearly written and results are convincing. But what I am not sure I understand is what is the purpose of this research. Among the 4 contributions listed in the end of the intro only the last one, Interpretability, seems to have a potential in terms on the impact. Yet am not quite sure how \u201cobtained group-sparse adversarial patterns better shed light on the mechanisms of adversarial perturbations\u201d. I think the mechanisms of adversarial perturbations remain as unclear as they were before this paper.\n\nI am not ready to recommend acceptance of this paper, because I think the due effort to explain the motivation for research and its potential impacts has not been done in this case. \n\nUPD: the discussion and the edits with the authors convinced me that I may have been a bit too strict. I have changed my score from 5 to 6.\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}
