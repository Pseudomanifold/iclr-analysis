{"title": "interesting topic, insufficient experiments", "review": " My main concern is that the authors fail to compare their appproach to any of the modelling approaches discussed in the related works section. In particular, as mentioned by the authors the WTTTE-RNN has a similar architecture and thus would have been a crucial baseline for comparisons.\n Furthermore, I would have liked to see an evaluation on more datasets, especially since the data in Appendix H indicate that the proposed approach is only marginally better than MLE-based model fitting.\nFinally, in addition to the metrics presented, conventional metrics such as the C-statistic would have been interesting.\n\nI further miss a discussion of alternative approaches to achieve well calibrated scores, especially posthoc calibration using the validation set as discussed in Guo et al, ICML 2017.\n\nRelated work is incomplete, for example the use of tensor-trains in RNNs to model EHR data (Yang et al) - would the proposed approach not benefit for the use of such tensorization to better model the high-dimensional, sparse EHR data?\n\n\nreferences:\nGuao et al, On Calibration of Modern Neural Networks, ICML 2017\nYang et al, Modeling progression free survival in breast cancer with tensorized recurrent neural networks and accelerated failure time models, Machine Learning for Healthcare Conference 2017", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
