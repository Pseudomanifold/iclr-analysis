{"title": "Convincing application of graph filtering techniques in classification", "review": "This paper gives an overview of the recently proposed techniques for filtering graph signals. Then, the classification performance of several types of graph filters is studied over a few data sets. In my understanding, the main contribution of the paper is an elaboration on the existing graph filtering approaches and different filtering strategies in the problem of classification and studying their links to the recent graph CNNs, rather than the development of a novel and original methodology. Nevertheless, I think that the study might be worth presenting as it is well-written and it offers a nice treatment towards better comprehension of graph filtering techniques in data analysis problems, with convincing performance figures.\n\nSome minor comments:\n\n- Can you please briefly describe what the classification tasks are in the experiments?\n- Typos in the sentence above (1) \u201cThe objective OF OF\u201d, and in (1): \u201cLaplcacian\u201d", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
