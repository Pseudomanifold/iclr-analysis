{"title": "see below", "review": "The paper presents the use of an invertible transformtion layer in addition to the conventional variational autoencoder to map samples from decoder to image space, and shows it improves over both synthesis quality and diversity. \nThe paper is well motivated, and the main motivation is nicely presented in Fig.1, and the main idea clearly shown in Fig.2 in an easy-to-understand manner. Existing works are properly discussed in the context before and after the main method. Convincing results are presented in the experimental section, with ablation tests in Tables 1-3, quantitative comparison in Table 4, and qualitative visual images in Figs.4-5. \n\nI incline to my current score after reading the response and other reviews.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
