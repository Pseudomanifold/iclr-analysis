{"title": "Borderline paper", "review": "1. The paper introduces the idea of some existing hand-crafted features into the deep learning framework, which is a smart way for building light weighted convolutional neural networks.\n\n2. I have noticed that binary patterns used in the paper are trainable, which means that these binary patterns can be seen as learned convolution filters with extremely space and computational complexity. Thus, the proposed method can also be recognized as a kind of binary network. \n\n3.  The baseline BCNN has a different architecture to the network using the proposed method. Thus, comparisons shown in Table 3 and Table 4 are somewhat unfair.\n\n4. The capability of the proposed method was only verified on character recognition datasets. Does it can be easily used for other tasks such as face recognition or object detection on some relatively large datasets?", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
