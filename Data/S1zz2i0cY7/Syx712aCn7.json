{"title": "Application paper: how to modify latent variable models s.t. they survive range coding transmission.", "review": "This paper explains that range coding as a mechanism for transmitting latent-variable codes from source to target for decoding is severely sensitive to floating point errors.\n\nThe authors propose what amounts to an integer version of Balle 2018, and demonstrate that it allows for transmission between platforms without catastrophic errors due to numerical round-off differences.\n\nThe paper (and problem) is of low significance, but the authors present a neat solution.\n\nPros:\n- Well defined problem and solution.\n- Practical question relating to use of ANNs for data en/de-coding.\n\nCons:\n- Presentation needs brushing up: e.g. why give two examples for H, b, v bit widths?\n- Some approximations are not well motivated or justified.  E.g. why is it valid to replace gradient of a function that has 0 gradients with the identity?\n- Paper needs some rewriting for clarity.  E.g. where is the kernel K defined?\n- Lack of experimentation to justify the fact that the construction of (16) leads to instabilities, and is therefore less suitable than the method outlined here.  \n\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
