{"title": "More understanding and experiments are needed to better motivate the model.", "review": "The paper proposes a novel Hebb-Rosenblatt working memory model to augment the recurrent attention model and achieves competitive results on the MNIST dataset. Some results on CIFAR and Celeb-A datasets are also shown. The code is released anonymously which substantiated the reproducibility of the results; however, I haven\u2019t physically run the code to verify it.\n\nMotivation: First, as much as I appreciate the research direction of combining recurrent attention models and working memory, the use of recurrent attention models is not well motivated throughout the article. It it of course biologically inspired, but the engineering benefit is not obvious. It has the benefit of model compression, using less parameters to process the attended region, yet pooling mechanisms can also achieve similar effect. It also has the benefit of model interpretability, but for vanilla feed-forward counterparts, it is also possible to visualize salient regions that impact the decisions. While feed-forward CNNs process all regions in parallel, sequential models will be much slower. The core question is the following, if the final task is just image classification, why is sequential processing necessary? The author should spend some text explaining why studying recurrent attention model + working memory is important. Ideally, if the author could consider tasks other than image classification, which could potentially highlight the need for sequential processing and working memory.\n\nNotation clarity: The clarity of model notation could be significantly improved. I am confused what is `e`, and my guess it is the layer I input. Figure 1 does not help my understanding. Notations such as \\mu, \\nu, M are left unexplained.\n\nUnderstanding of the model: Although Hebbian learning rule is a well established mechanism, the article doesn\u2019t provide much insight into why the rule is applied here but rather just stipulates them in Section 3.1 as the overall formulation of the memory network. What would be the objective function for such an update rule (e.g. the delta decay term corresponds to a L2 weight decay term)? For the applications studied in the paper, i.e. image classification, why does the model need to ever forget?\n\nCIFAR/Celeb-A experiments: There is no tabulated results for these experiments. I only see CIFAR gets 93.05% accuracy, without mention of any baselines. Since attention mechanisms are used here, it would be a much stronger argument to report results on higher resolution images than CIFAR (which is 32x32).\n\nModel interpretability: Model interpretability is often one of the biggest selling point of attention-based models. However, by examining the glimpse locations on CIFAR datasets, the model learns to look at the whole image for all glimpses, which hurts the argument of using a recurrent attention model. Also for MNIST experiments, the best number is achieved by using S_g=28, which has the glimpse size of the whole image. The author claims that it can learn a good representation despite the not so good looking glimpse visualization, but so can regular feed-forward CNNs.\n\nComparison to VAEs: Since VAE formulations are used, it would be good if the authors can compare the model with vanilla VAE and convolutional VAEs, both in terms of classification accuracy and reconstructed sample quality.\n\nComparison to DRAW: It is also recommended to show more visualization comparison to DRAW, and pinpoint the differences of using a canvas based memory vs. the proposed Hebb-Rosenblatt working memory.\n\nIn conclusion, I think the paper opens a promising direction of combining recurrent attention models and working memory networks. I believe it is a huge amount of engineering effort to make this model to work, as we can see in the Appendix and the released code base. However, there are several issues as I pointed above, most notably the motivation, and understanding of the models. The experiments on CIFAR and Celeb-A could been done more thoroughly, and I also believe that it would make more impact if the authors can show experiments other than image classification that highlight the need for a recurrent attention model equipped with working memory. Based on the above reasons, I think the paper could be better polished for future publication.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
