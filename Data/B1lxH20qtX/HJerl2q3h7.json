{"title": "Collection of primitive agents is interesting, but", "review": "This paper investigates a collection of primitive agents that learns to self-assemble into complex collectives to solve control tasks.\nThe motivation of the paper is interesting. The project videos are attractive. However there are some issues:\n1. The proposed model is specific to the \"multi-limb\" setting. I don't understand the applicability to other setting. How much generality does the method (or the experiment) have?\n\n2. Comparison to other existing methods is not enough. There are many state-of-the-art RL algorithms, and there should be natural extension to this problem setting. I can not judge whether the proposed methods work better or not.\n\n3. The algorithm is not described in detail. For example, detail of the sensor inputs, action spaces, and the whole algorithm including hyper-parameters are not explained well.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
