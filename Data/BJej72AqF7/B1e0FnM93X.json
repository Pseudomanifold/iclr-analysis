{"title": "Interesting view point, but with limited applications", "review": "In this paper, the authors provide a novel approach towards understanding\nRNNs using max-affine spline operators (MASO). Specifically, they rewrite RNNs\nwith piecewise affine and convex activations MASOs and provide some\nexplanation to the use of noisy initial hidden state. \n\nThe paper can be improved in presentation. More high level explanation should\nbe given on MASOs and why this new view of RNN is better. \n\nTo best of my knowledge, this is the first paper that related RNNs with MASOs\nand provides insights on this re-formulation. However, the authors failed to\nfind more useful applications of this new formulation other than finding that\nnoisy initial hidden state helps in regularization. Also, the re-formulation\nis restricted to piecewise affine and convex activation functions (Relu and\nleaky-Relu). \n\nIn general, I think this is an original work providing interesting viewing\npoint, but could be further improved if the authors find more applications of\nthe MASO form. \n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
