{"title": "Good quality paper, experimentation can be improved", "review": "The paper rewrites equations of Elman RNN in terms of so-called max-affine spline operators. Paper claims that this reformulation allows better analysis and, in particular, gives an insight to use initial state noise to regularize hidden states and fight exploding gradients problem.\n\nThe paper seems to be theoretically sound. The experiment with sequential MNIST looks very promising, thought it would be great to check this method on other datasets (perhaps, toy data) to check that this is not a fluke. The bird audio dataset is not well benchmarked in the literature. The paper could make much stronger claim with more extensive experimentation.\n\nSome typos:\n- p3: an simple -> a simple\n- Figure 2 caption is not finished\n- p5 last paragraph: extra full stop\n- Fig 3: correct and negative probably switched around\n- p7: in regularize -> in regularization\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
