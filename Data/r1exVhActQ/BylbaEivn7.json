{"title": "Nice Theoretical Insights, but Not Sure How Experiments  Substantiate the Theory", "review": "The paper theoretically analyzes the sparsity property of the stationary point of layerwise l1-regularized network trimming. Experiments are conducted to show that reaching a stationary point of the optimization can help to deliver good performance. Specific comments follow.\n\n1. While the paper analyzes the properties of the stationary point of the layerwise objective (5), the experiments seem to be conducted based on the different joint objective (8). Experimental results of optimizing (5) seem missing. While the reviewer understands that (5) and (8)  are closely related, and the theoretical insights for (5) can potentially translate to the scenario in (8), the reviewer is not sure whether the theory for (5)  is rigorously justified by the experiments.\n\n2. It is also unclear how tight the bound provided by Theorem 1 is.  Is the bound vacuous? Relevant statistics in the experiments might need to be reported to elucidate this point.\n\n3. It is also unclear how the trade-off in point (b) of the abstract is justified in the experiments.\n\nMinor Points:\npage 2, the definition of $X^{(j)}$, the index of $l$ and $j$ seem to be typos.\npage 2, definition 1, the definition of the bracket need to be specified. \npage 4, the concept of stationary point and general position can be introduced before presenting Theorem 1 to improve readability.\npage 4, Corollary 1, should it be $nnz(\\hat{W})\\le JN k_{\\mathcal{S}}$?\npage 7, Table 2, FLOPS should be FLOP? \npage 8, is FLOP related to the time/speed needed for compression? If so, it should be specified. If not, compression runtime should also be reported.\n\n\n\n\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
