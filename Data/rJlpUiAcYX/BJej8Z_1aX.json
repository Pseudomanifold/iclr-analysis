{"title": "Nice contribution but room for improvements", "review": "This paper proposes permutation invariant loss functions which depends on the distance of sets. They motivate this by problems where one wants to detect objects (say stones in an image) where there is no explicit ordering of objects. \n\nPros: The idea sounds interesting and seems like this approach could work well in practice. The authors provide an interesting algorithm which minimizes this loss function in O(N^2) instead of O(N^3). Moreover, the authors also show interesting properties of the Holographic loss, along with some interesting properties of the minima etc.\n\nCons: My major criticism of this work is that, while this seems like an interesting idea, the authors do not really provide extensive results on real world datasets. They consider a simple proof of concept which is based on MNIST images. I do not think this is sufficient. I would have been much more convinced with this paper if I had seen results on Pascal VOC and COCO, since this is the main motivation of their work.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
