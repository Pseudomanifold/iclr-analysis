{"title": "Interesting but not good enough!", "review": "This paper presents a framework to train an end-to-end multi-lingual multi-speaker speech recognition system. Overall, the paper is quite clear written.\n- Strengthens:\n+ Experimental results show consistent improvements in speech recognition performance and language identification performance.\n\n- Weakness:\n+ I'm not sure whether the framework is novel. The authors have just mixed training data from several languages to train an end-to-end multi-speaker speech recognition system.\n+ I don't see the real motivation why the authors want to make the task harder than needed. The example provided in figure 1 is very rare in reality.\n+ The authors claimed that their system can recognise code-switching but actually randomly mixing data from different languages are not code-switching.\n+ In general, it would be better to have some more analyses showing what the system can do and why.", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
