{"title": "A paper with some problems", "review": "This paper proposes to combine the gradients of source domains to help the learning in the target domain.\n\nAccording to Eq. (1), it seems that the proposed model is not so flexible as claimed in the introduction since an implicit assumption behind Eq. (1) is that different tasks share the same network architecture. If the source and target tasks are from different domains, how to adjust the weights associated with the input layers since different tasks have different feature representations with different dimensionalities. Similar situation happens to the output layer for different types of tasks as the label spaces are different.\n\nAuthors claim that problem (5) is a constrained non-linear optimization problem. However, in my opinion, this is a linear programming problem with an analytical and trivial solution. I don't know where the nonlinearity comes.\n\nThe use of pseudo labels is very common in semi-supervised learning. I cannot see any significant contribution of the proposed methods compared with existing approaches.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
