{"title": "Overall Interesting work: clear motivation and nice performance gain", "review": "This paper proposes a multi-level embedding (MILE) framework, which can be applied on top of existing network embedding methods and helps them scale to large scale networks with faster speed. To get the backbone structure of graph, MILE repeatedly coarsens the graph into smaller ones using a hybrid matching technique, and GCN is used for the refinement of embeddings.\n\n[+] The paper is well-written and the idea is clearly presented.\n[+] MILE is able to reduce computational cost while achieving comparable, or sometimes even better embedding quality. \n[+] MILE is general enough to apply to different underlying embedding strategies.\n[-] Most of the baseline methods are of similar type, since LINE, DeepWalk, node2vec and NetMF can all be unified to matrix factorization framework. There have been many new network embedding methods proposed in the past two years. It would be interesting to see how much MILE can help scale these methods.\n\nOverall, though there have already been hundreds of papers on network embedding in the past 2~3 years, I think this paper can be an interesting addition to this fast-growing area. Therefore, I would recommend to accept it.\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
