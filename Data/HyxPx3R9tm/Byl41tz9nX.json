{"title": "a constraint on the discriminator of GAN model to maintain informative gradients", "review": "This paper proposed a constraint on the discriminator of GAN model to maintain informative gradients. It is completed by control the mutual information between the observations and the discriminator\u2019s internal representation to be no bigger than a predefined value.  The idea is interesting and the discussions of applications in different areas are useful. However, I still have some concerns about the work:\n1.\tin the experiments about image generation, it seems that the proposed method does not enhance the performance obviously when compared to GP and WGAN-GP, Why the combination of VGAN and GP can enhance the performance greatly(How do they complementary to each other), what about the performance when combine VGAN with WGAN-GP?\n2.\tHow do you combine VGAN and GP, is there any parameter to balance their effect?\n3.\tThe author stated on page 2 that \u201cthe  proposed information bottleneck encourages the discriminator to ignore irrelevant cues, which then allows the generator to focus on improving the most discerning differences between real and fake samples\u201d, a proof on theory or experiments should be used to illustrate this state.\n4.\tIs it possible to apply GP and WGAN-GP to the Motion imitation or adversarial inverse reinforcement learning problems? If so, will it perform better than VGAN?\n5.\tHow about VGAN compares with Spectral norm GAN?\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
