{"title": "Interesting paper addressing a difficult problem. Good formalization and reasonable evaluation ", "review": "I like the idea of the paper and I believe it addressing a very relevant problem. While the authors provide a good formalization of the problem and convincing demonstration of the generalization bound, the evaluation could have been better by including some more challenging experiments to really prove the point of the paper. It is surely good to present the toy example with the MNIST dataset but the ethnicity domain is less difficult than what the authors claim. This is also pretty evident from the results presented (e.g., in Table 3). The proposed approach provides maybe slightly better results than the state of the art but the results do not seem to be statistically significant. This is probable also due to the fact that the problem itself is made simpler by the cropped faces, no background, etc. I would have preferred to see an application domain where the improvement would be more substantial. Nevertheless, I think the theoretical presentation is good and I believe the manuscript has very good potential.
