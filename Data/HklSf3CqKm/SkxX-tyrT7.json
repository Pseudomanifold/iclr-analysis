{"title": "A good paper ", "review": "This paper studies dictionary learning problem by a non-convex constrained l1 minimization. By using subgradient descent algorithm with random initialization, they provide a non-trivial global convergence analysis for problem. The result is interesting, which does not depend on the complicated initializations used in other methods. \n\nThe paper could be better, if the authors could provide more details and results on numerical experiments.   This could be used to confirm the proved theoretical properties in practical algorithms.
