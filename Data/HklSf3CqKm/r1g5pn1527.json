{"title": "Relevant problem,  incomplete paper", "review": "The paper proposes a subgradient descent method to learn orthogonal, squared /complete n x n  dictionaries under l1 norm regularization. The problem is interesting and relevant, and the paper, or at least the first part, is clear.\n\nThe most interesting property is that the solution does not depend on the dictionary initialization, unlike many other competing methods. \n\nThe experiments sections in disappointingly short. Could the authors play with real data? How does sparsity affect the results? How does it change with different sample complexities? Also, it would be nice to have a final conclusion section. I think the paper contains interesting material but, overall, it gives the impression that the authors rushed to submit the paper before the deadline!", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess"}
