{"title": "Unclear improvement over state-of-the-art saliency maps extractors", "review": "This paper introduces a new saliency map extractor to visualize which input features are relevant for the deep neural network to recognize objects in the image. The proposed saliency map extractor searches over a big space of potentially relevant image features and in-fills the irrelevant image regions using generative models.\n\nThe algorithmic machinery in the paper is poorly justified, as it is presented as a series of steps without providing much intuition why these steps are useful (especially compared to previous works). Also, I would like to know how this paper compares to Fan et al. \"Adversarial localization network\" (NIPS workshop, 2017), which has not been cited and it proposes similar ideas.\n\nAlso, the results are not convincing. Only one previous work (among many) has been compared with the proposed algorithm, and the qualitative examples are not enlightening showing the advantages of the introduced saliency map extractor. What are the new insights into the functioning of deep networks that were gained from the proposed saliency map extractor?\n\nIn summary, it is unclear to me if there is any novelty in the approach (missing references, lack of motivation of the algorithm) and if the results show any improvement over previous works (only one previous work has been compared and the qualitative examples do not show anything particularly interesting).", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
