{"title": "Novel approach to graph neural networks with strong empirical evaluation", "review": "The authors propose a novel method for learning graph convolutional networks. The core idea is to use the Lanczos algorithm to obtain a low-rank approximation of the graph Laplacian. The authors propose two ways to include the Lanczos algorithm. First, as a preprocessing step where the algorithm is applied once on the input graph and the resulting approximation is fixed during learning. Second, by including a differentiable version of the algorithm into an end-to-end trainable model. \n\nThe proposed method is novel and achieves good results on a set of experiments. \n\nThe authors discuss related work in a thorough and meaningful manner. \n\nThere is not much to criticize. This is a very good paper. The almost 10 pages are perhaps a bit excessive considering there was an (informal) 8 page limit. It might make sense to provide a more accessible discussion of the method and Theorem 1, and move some more detailed/technical parts in pages 4, 5, and 6 to an appendix. \n", "rating": "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
