{"title": "Application paper w/o research contributions.", "review": "This work adresses the problem of finding duplicate or near duplicate images from biomedical publications. The authors propose standard CNN and loss functions and apply it to this field. The evaluation is performed on an in-house dataset and synthetic data.\n\nNovelty:\nThere are no significant new contributions other than the application to this very narrow field. The experimental results don't appear to be very conclusive wrt the usability of this proposed approach.\n\nClarity:\nThe paper is written well and mostly clear. Eq 1 does not explain what the sum over k is about. Eq 2/3 seems to have a typo and should be f^01, f^02.\n\nExperiments:\nIt is not clear what the classes in Sec 4 refer to, and more specifically what the distinction between classes and categories is. It seems that categories are different types of images whereas classes are different transformations of images in the same category. If this is the case it doesn't seem very instructive to compare the accuracy across categories.\n\nFig3 a/b shows a scatter plot, I believe that a ROC curve would be much more instructive here.\n\nIt is not clear what exactly was compared when comparing with U-Net. The authors mention that their models train faster and don't require labelled data, but some more details of what exactly was compared would be helpful. E.g. what exactly was pre-trained and fine-tuned.\n\nOverall this work does not seem suitable for ICLR due to the narrow application, lack of positive results and no scientific contributions beyond what's already widely used in the vision community.", "rating": "2: Strong rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
