{"title": "This paper proposes a combination scheme using cross-entropy method (CEM) and Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients  (TD3), a policy of deep RL algorithm which improves over Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG). ", "review": "The contributions of this paper are in the domain of policy search, where the authors combine evolutionary and gradient-based methods. Particularly, they propose a combination approach based on cross-entropy method (CEM) and TD3 as an alternative to existing combinations using either a standard evolutionary algorithm or a goal exploration process in tandem with the DDPG algorithm. Then, they show that CEM-RL has several advantages compared to its competitors and provides a satisfactory trade-off between performance and sample efficiency.\n\nThe authors evaluate the resulting algorithm, CEM-RL, using a set of benchmarks well established in deep RL, and they show that CEM-RL benefits from several advantages over its competitors and offers a satisfactory trade-off between performance and sample efficiency.  It is a pity to see that the authors provide acronyms without explicitly explaining them such as DDPG and TD3, and this right from the abstract.\n\nThe parer is  in general interesting, however the clarity of the paper is hindered  by the existence of several typos, and the writing in certain passages can be improved. Example of typos include  \u201can surrogate gradient\u201d, \u201c\"an hybrid algorithm\u201d,  \u201cmost fit individuals are used \u201d and so on\u2026 \n\nIn the related work the authors present the connection between their work and contribution to the state of the art in a detailed manner.  Similarly, in section 3 the authors provide an extensive background allowing to understand their proposed method.\n\nIn equation 1, 2 the updates of  \\mu_new and \\sigma_new uses \\lambda_i, however the authors provide common choices for \\lambda without any justification or references.\n\nThe proposed method is clearly explained and seems convincing. However the theoretical contribution is poor. And the experiment uses a very classical benchmark providing simulated data.\n\n1. In the experimental study, the authors present the value of their tuning parameters (learning rate, target rate, discount rate\u2026) at the initialisation phase without any justifications. And the experiments are limited to simulated data obtained from MUJOCO physics engine - a very classical benchmark. \n2. Although the experiments are detailed and interesting they support poor theoretical developments and use a very classical benchmark\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
