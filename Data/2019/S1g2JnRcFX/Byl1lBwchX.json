{"title": "Interesting direction", "review": "This paper presents an analysis of \"local SGD\", which averages estimators obtained by running SGD in separate machines once in a while. The paper presents bounds on \"how frequent\" the estimators required to be averaged in order to yield linear parallelization speedups. This is an interesting paper, but I have some concerns that I will elaborate on below:\n\n[1] This paper's assumption of bounded variance of Stochastic Gradients and drawing conclusions about frequency of averaging does not reflect practical implementations of SGD for Machine Learning contexts. For example, note that in this oracle model, there exists bound on batch size (T^alpha, alpha\\in[1/3,1/2]) that yield linear parallelization speedups (for example, see Dekel et al. (2012)); however, as Dekel et al (2012) note, such bounds are fairly crude estimates on a per-problem basis for practical purposes. These issues naturally continue to exist with regards to the upperbound on the frequency of communication as argued by this paper. \n\n[2] Furthermore, the claim that such a bound on frequency of communication for local SGD which is not known before is not really true. In the convex case, the paper of Jain et al. (2016) presents a precise characterization of when to average of iterates across machines to obtain linear parallelization speedups, and this is a problem dependent quantity that works without assumptions such as bounded variance of stochastic gradients for the least squares problem. Note that, as reflective in practice, this result conveys that averaging the solutions of multiple independent runs of SGD does not help anything when the bias (initial error) dominates the variance. \n\n[3] Note that local SGD has been known for a while and is referred to as Iterative Parameter Mixing in the literature. An example of this is the thesis of Greg Coppola (2015). A more careful literature search can provide more references/results on this topic.\n\n[4] This paper claims that (in page 2) in order to \"improve computation versus communication tradeoff, one can increase the batch size or increase communication interval\". This appears to be an imprecise statement. For example, if I kept increasing batchsize without any limit, and the bias in my problem is much larger than the variance (where bias and variance follows definitions from Bach and Moulines (2011,2013)), this does not lead to any parallelization speedup. This is in contrast to when the variance dominates the bias, wherein, model averaging/increasing batch size helps. What is the reason for the authors to conclude that increasing batch size is equivalent to increasing communication interval?", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
