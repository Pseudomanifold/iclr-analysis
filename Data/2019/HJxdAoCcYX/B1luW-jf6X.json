{"title": "Important topic but significance can be improved", "review": "The study of detecting malicious edges in graphs is interesting and important.  However, the significance of the paper can be improved.  To properly test the detection performance, I recommend that the authors run experiments on various random graph models. Examples of random graph models include Erdos-Renyi, Stochastic Kronecker Graph, Configuration Model with power-law degree distribution, Barabasi-Albert, Watts-Strogatz, Hyperbolic Graphs, Block Two-level Erdos-Renyi, Multiplicative Attribute Graph Model, etc. That way we can learn on what types of networks the detection performance is better.  Also, in terms of detection models, I recommend that the authors try approaches that look for goodness of fit and model selection (e.g., see https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.11220.pdf).", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
