{"title": "Interesting paper", "review": "This paper proposed a reformulation of objective function to solve the hard-label black-box attack problem. The idea is interesting and the performance of the proposed method seem to be capable of finding adversarial examples with smaller distortions and less queries compared with other hard-label attack algorithms. \n\nThis paper is well-written and clear.\n\n==============================================================================================\nQuestions\n\nA. Can it be proved the g(theta) is continuous? Also, the theoretical analysis assume the property of Lipschitz-smooth and thus obtain the complexity of number of queries. Does this assumption truly hold for g(theta), when f is a neural network classifiers? If so, how to obtain the Lipschitz constant of g that is used in the analysis sec 6.3? \n\nB. What is the random distortion in Table 1? What initialization technique is used for the query direction in the experiments? \n\nC. The GBDT result on MNIST dataset is interesting. The authors should provide tree models description in 4.1.3. However, on larger dataset, say imagenet, are the tree models performance truly comparable to ImageNet? If the test accuracy is low, then it seems less meaningful to compare the adversarial distortion with that of imagenet neural network classifiers. Please explain. \n\nD. For sec 3.2, it is not clear why the approximation is needed. Because the gradient of g with respect to theta is using equation (7) and theta is already given (from sampling); thus the Linf norm of theta is a constant. Why do we need the approximation? Given that, will there be any problems on the L2 norm case? \n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
