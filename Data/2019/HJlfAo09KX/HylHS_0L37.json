{"title": "Review", "review": "Paper Summary:\nThis paper studies the problem of recovering a true underlying neural network (assuming there exists one) with cross-entropy loss. This paper shows if the input is standard Gaussian, within a small ball around the ground truth, the objective function is strongly convex and smooth if there is a sufficiently large number of samples. Furthermore, the global minimizer is actually the true neural network. This geometric analysis implies applying gradient descent within this neighborhood, one can recover the underlying neural network. This paper also proposed a provable method based on spectral learning to find a good initialization point. Lastly, this paper also provides some simulation studies.\n\nComments:\nThis paper closely follows a recent line of work on recovering a neural network under Gaussian input assumption. While studying cross-entropy loss is interesting, the analysis techniques in this paper are very similar to Zhong et al. 2017, so this paper is incremental. I believe studying the global convergence of the gradient descent or relaxing the Gaussian input assumption is more interesting.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
