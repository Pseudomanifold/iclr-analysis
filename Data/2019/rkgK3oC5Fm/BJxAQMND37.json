{"title": "a nice applied work", "review": "The paper presents an application of Bayesian neural networks in predicting \nfuture street scenes. The inference is done by using variational approximation \nto the posterior. Moreover, the authors propose to using a synthetic (approximate)\nlikelihood and the optimization step in variational approxiation is based on a regularization.\nThese modifications are claimed by the authors that it yields a better results in practice \n(more stable, capture the multi-modal nature). Numerical parts in the paper support\nthe authors' claims: their method outperforms some other state-of-the-art methods.\n\nThe presentation is not too hard to follow.\nI think this is a nice applied piece, although I have never worked on this applied side.\n\nMinor comment:\nIn the second sentence, in Section 3.1, page 3, \n$f: x \\mapsto y$    NOT $f: x \\rightarrow y$. \nWe use the \"\\rightarrow\" for spaces X,Y not for variables.  \n\n\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}
