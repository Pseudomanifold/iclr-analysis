{"title": "Reviewer comments", "review": "This paper presents an algorithm to find adversarial attacks to binary neural networks.  Binary neural networks uses sign functions as nonlinearities, making the network essentially discrete.  Previous attempts at finding adversarial attacks for binary neural networks either rely on relaxation which cannot find very good adversarial examples, or calling a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) solver which doesn\u2019t scale.  This paper proposes to decompose the problem and iteratively find desired representations layer by layer from the top to the input.  This so called Integer Propagation (IProp) algorithm is more efficient than solving the full MILP as it solves much smaller MILP problems, one for each layer, thus each step can be solved relatively quickly.  The authors then proposed a few more improvements to the IProp algorithm, including ways to do local adjustments to the solutions, and warming starting from an existing solution.  Experiments on binary neural nets trained for MNIST and Fashion MNIST show the superiority of the proposed method over MILP and relaxation based algorithms.\n\nOverall I found the paper to be very clear and the proposed method is sound.  I think combining ideas from discrete / combinatorial optimization with deep learning is an important research direction and can shed light on training and verifying models with discrete components, like the hard nonlinearities in the binary neural nets studied in this paper.\n\nIn terms of the particular proposed approach, it is hard for me to imagine the blind IProp that does not take the input into account until the last layer is ever going to work.  The small step size modifications make a lot more sense.  Regarding the selection of the set S, in the paper the authors simply sampled elements to be in S uniformly, but it seems possible to make use of the information from the forward pass, and choose the hidden units that are the closed to reaching the desired activations.  Would that be any better?\n\nA few minor comments:\n- when reporting warm start results, it would be good to also show the performance of the FGSM solution used for warm starting, in addition to the other two results shown in Figure 6 to have a more complete comparison\n- the hidden units h_{l,j} were formulated to be in {0, 1} in equation (7), but everywhere else in the paper they are assumed to be in {-1, +1}, which is not consistent and slightly confusing.\n\nOverall I think this is a solid paper and support accepting it for publication.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
