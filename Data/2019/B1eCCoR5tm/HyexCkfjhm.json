{"title": "numbers, comparisons, and pratical value", "review": "\tThis paper proposes a data ensemble method for image classification: sub sample an image, classify each sub sample, and vote those sub samples to get the final decision.\n\t\n\tQuestions:\n\t1. The validation accuracy of ResNet is much lower than that reported in the original ResNet paper, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf. For example, the top-1/5 accuracy of RestNet-50 is 79+/94+, which is only about 70+/89+% in this paper. Similarly, there is a big gap between the results of ResNet-152 reported in this paper and the original ResNet paper. Maybe I misunderstand something; otherwise, the results in this paper are not reliable.\n\t2. This work does not compare with any other data augmentation methods for testing, e.g., the widely used 10-crop test [ref1, ref2]: \u201cAt test time, the network makes a prediction by extracting five 224 \u00d7 224 patches (the four corner patches and the center patch) as well as their horizontal reflections (hence ten patches in all), and averaging the predictions made by the network\u2019s softmax layer on the ten patches.\u201d\n        3. A minor issue is the practical value of this work. If one can afford the computational cost of data ensemble test, why not train m (as the data ensemble in this paper) models and ensemble them given that ensemble of models usually brings more accuracy improvement? Note that the training of multiple models is conducted offline and the ensemble of models is of the same computation cost compared with the method in this paper. \n\n[ref1] Krizhevsky, Alex, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey E.
