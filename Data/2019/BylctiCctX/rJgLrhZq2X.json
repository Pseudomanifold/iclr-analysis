{"title": "nice solid paper", "review": "This paper is about using \"neural stethoscopes\", small complementary neural networks that are added to a main network which with their auxilary loss functions can measure suitability of features or guide the learning process. The idea is incremental to multi-task learning and enable, in a single framework, to validate intermediate features for additional related tasks. Moreover it can promote or suppress the correlation of such features to the tasks related to the main one. The framework is applied to the task of visual stability prediction of block towers. The paper builds upon Groth et al. 2018, adding the concept of local stability as correlated secondary task, used with the proposed neural stethoscopes. Experiments with an extension of ShapeStacks (Groth et al. 2018) dataset where the local stability is added to the global stability class, show that it is possibile increase the performance using the additional task. Moreover, it is shown that neural stethoscopes can suppress nuisance information when using a biased training dataset where the local and global stability are purposely inversely correlated.\n\nStrengths:\n+ A very nice paper, well written and easy to read. Figures are helpful and the structure is clear.\n+ The concept of neural stethoscope is interesting and simplify the concepts behind multitask learning.\n+ Experiments are convincing, interesting and there is some novelty in vision stability prediction.\n\nWeaknesses:\n- The novelty is limited related to multitask learning, thus it is an incremental paper.\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
