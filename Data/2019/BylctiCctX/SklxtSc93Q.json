{"title": "Preliminary report, the idea could be shaped into a better one", "review": "This paper combines the global and local stability prediction and tries to get interpretable results using the stethoscope design, which is actually a weighted subbranch for the main branch. There are several concerns regarding the proposed framework. \n\n1) How to choose \\lambda? A better design could be a learnable \\lambda. Instead of just one scalar value, it could be better to learn a map of \\lambdas, which indicates the distribution of local stability and how it is related to global stability. The visualization of the \\lambda map might be more interpretable for understanding the stability prediction. \n\n2) The global stability prediction does not have a consistent correlation with the local stability prediction, as shown by the easy and hard examples. This complex relationship will confuse the network during the training. That is, the current design hasn't well considered the local and global stability relation, but just simply sum them up. This is hard to provide a meaningful interpretation of the task. \n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
