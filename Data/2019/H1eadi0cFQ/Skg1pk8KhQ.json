{"title": "review", "review": "The paper addresses the problem of increasing and decreasing the number of hidden nodes (aka, dimensionality) in the network such that the optimization will not enter the plateaus of saddle points. The opening or closing of tunnels (filters) guarantee the existence of \u201cnew escape directions\u201d and faster convergence. \n\nStrengths:\n+ provide a new perspective of designing the shape/dimensionality of a network in a dynamic manner. \n+ provide theoretic proof of CNNs and FCs on the contribution to the gradient after cloning. \n\nWeakness:\n- Experiments are very weak to verify the theory.\n\nDetailed comments:\n\n- Eqn. (6) seems to provide a unified evaluation on the contribution of two units to the gradients. How does it relate to the experiments? It gives me a sense that the manuscript is isolated between theory (Section 2 and 3) and verification (experiments).\n- Why does the blue curve get stuck in a flat area? A better staring learning rate could alleviate the plateau bottleneck. \n- The experiment settings are a little bit simple, even for the most complicated one in Section 4.4, where there are five conv layers and the tunnel opening only involves one single filter. Do authors conduct more filters opening in more layers? How about the closing case? There is no result/analysis in the experiments. \n- Why authors claim the blue curve in the left figure 2, a \u201cflat area\u201d? It seems working as the orange one (loss decreases normally). \n- Another big concern is that the proposed method is supposed to prevent network from saddle points and faster convergence, which is verified. And yet, the ultimate goal is to improve the performance. I am surprised that there is no such result at all in the manuscript (for example, error rate goes down on cifar/mnist/etc). \n\nIn summary, I do recognize the theoretical effort the paper has provided; however, the experiments seem not to verify the proposed method in a professional manner. \n\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
