{"title": "Countering Language Drift via Grounding", "review": "Summary:\nThis paper tries to verify a hypothesis that language grounding DO help to overcome language drift when two agents creating their own protocol in order to communicate with each other. There are several constraints to enforce: 1) naturalness, say \"Englishness\", 2) grounded in visual semantics. The experiments prove that both constraints help the most (say, BLUE score). 1) w/o 2) restricts the vocabulary into a small set with the most frequent words, while 1) with 2) can resemble the original distribution. \n\nStrength:\n- How to make the protocol automatically created by two agents much explainable/meaningful is a very interesting topic. This paper explores plausible constraints to reach this goal. \n\nWeakness:\n- Visual grounding task brings more data there. To fairly compare, I hope to add one more baseline PG+LM+G_text, where G_text simply means to use text data (captions) alone, i.e., without visual signals.\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
