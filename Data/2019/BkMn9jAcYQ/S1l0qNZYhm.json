{"title": "Is BLEU the right metric?", "review": "The paper presents an approach to refining a translation system with grounding (in addition to LM scores) in the loop to manage linguistic drift.  The intuition is straightforward and results are clearly presented, but the gains are unfortunately much weaker than I would have hoped for.  \n\nThe results for both Fr-En and Fr-En-De only show very small gains for adding grounding, often with PG+LM results being within 1 std-dev of the PG+LM+G results.  Otherwise, the results are quite nice with interesting increases in linguistic diversity.  This leads me to wonder if this approach would show more gains with a human evaluation rather than BLEU score. \n\nWhat is the performance of PG+G without the +LM?  \n\nMinor -- In Fig 2, should the green line (PG+LM) have continued climbing to >21 BLEU?", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
