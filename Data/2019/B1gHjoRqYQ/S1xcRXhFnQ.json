{"title": "Unclear problem statement; mixed results", "review": "i have change my rating from 5 to 6 after reading the numerous and thorough rebuttals from the authors. I hope they will incorporate these clarifications and additional experiments into the final version of the paper if accepted.\n\nThe purpose of this paper is presumably to approximate the margin of a sample as accurately as possible. This is clearly an intractable problem. Thus all attacks make some kind of approximation, including this paper. I am still a bit confused about the difference between \"zero-confidence attacks\" and those that don't fall into that category such as PGD. Since all of these are approximations, and we cannot know how far we are from the true margin, I don't see why these categories help. The authors spend two paragraphs in the introduction trying to draw a distinction but I am still not convinced. \n\nThe proofs provided by the authors assume that convexity and many assumptions, which makes it not very useful for the real world case. What would have been helpful is to show the accuracy of their margin for simple binary toy 2D problems, where the true margin and their approximation can be visualized. This was not done. This reduces the paper to an empirical exercise rather than a true understanding of their method's advantages and limitations.\n\nFinally, the experimental results do not show any significant advantage over PGD, either in running time (they are slower) or norm perturbation. Thus their novelty rests on the definition of zero confidence attack, and of the importance of such a attack. So clarifying the above question will help to judge the paper's novelty.\n\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
