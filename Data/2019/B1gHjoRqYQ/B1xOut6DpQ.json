{"title": "I cannot see why the proposed method is better than CW attack", "review": "This paper proposes an efficient zero-confidence attack algorithm, MARGINATTACK, which uses the modified Rosen's algorithm to optimize the same objective as CW attack. Under a set of conditions, the authors proved convergence of the proposed attack algorithm. My main concern about this paper is why this algorithm has a better performance than CW attack? I would suggest comparing with CW attack under different sets of hyper-parameters.\n\nMinor comment:\nThe theoretical proof depends on the convexity assumption, I would also suggest comparing the proposed attack with CW and other benchmarks on some simple models that satisfy the assumptions.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
