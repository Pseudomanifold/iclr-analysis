{"title": "Interesting idea but insufficient clarity and technical depth ", "review": " This paper proposes a novel idea of outputting a quantum state that represents a complete cost landscape of all parameters for a given binary neural network, by constructing a quantum binary neural network (QBNN). And then the landscape state is utilized to training the neural network by using the standard quantum amplitude amplification method.   \n\nAlthough this idea is interesting, I trend to reject this submission as I think its presentation is unclear and the technical detail is a little difficult to follow. So, the correctness and soundness of this work is difficult to verify. I urge the authors to revise their draft to provide more and clearer technical details.\n\nDetailed comments and questions:\n\nCould the authors further point out that what the scope of the binary features are, {0, 1} or {-1, +1}? To my understanding, it should be {-1, +1}, or the corresponding variables are always +1. In addition, the construction of the \u201cmultiplying values by binary weights\u201d module implies that the value should take -1 or +1, rather than 0 or 1. However, at the bottom of page 5, the authors claim that the binary values take +1 and 0. Could the authors clearly explain the term \u201cparameter\u201d and \u201cvalue\u201d?\n \nCould the author further explain how to construct the majority activation function?\nIn the part of \u201ccalculating accuracy\u201d, the authors mention that \u201crunning the QBNN with the weights in superposition for each point in the training set separately\u201d and \u201cthere are N qubits containing the prediction of the QBNN\u201d. To my understanding, there are 3 qubits representing the 8 weights, several qubits representing the input values, and N qubits representing the predictions. But how to construct the final landscape state to be optimized with these qubits?\n \nCould the author explain intuitively the main idea of the amplitude amplification method? Specifically, what is the relation between the qubits representing parameters and the qubits presenting prediction results?\n \nDuring the amplitude amplification process, the probabilities change periodically. How to select the best number of steps k in advanced if we do not known the best parameter? Or how to judge if the training is success?\n \nOverall speaking, I think this paper is interesting. However, the presentation is unclear and I suggest the authors to revise their draft by providing more technical details.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
