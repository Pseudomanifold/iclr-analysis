{"title": "A preliminary work of context-aware forecasting method", "review": "This paper proposes a context-aware forecasting method by learning embedding exogenous features within recurrent neural networks, and applies it in forecasting tap-in logs in subway network. Results show that using exogenous features in embedding vectors improves the performance. It is happy to see the transportation application of deep learning. However, the current paper is preliminary. The detailed comments are as follows.\n\n1. A lot of works have been done on applying varies of spatio-temporal features in neural networks for time series forecasting in the literature. The authors are suggested to compare with such methods.\n \n2. In experiments, 15 days out of the total 92 days are pulled out due to disturbed traffic pattern and extreme values are truncated by a bound. This makes the problem easier. However, in real world application we cannot simply do this. This makes the results not convincing and also makes me worry about the real application of the proposed algorithm.\n\n3.  The authors only compare the proposed algorithm with some naive baseline, such as averaged historical values. To show the advantage of this method, more state-of-the-art forecasting methods should be compared.\n ", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
