{"title": "Interesting idea but too poorly explained", "review": "The idea seems rather interesting and the experimental results encouraging (although -- small point-- I found your plotted curves for BatchNorm on Cifar-100 rather suspicious, there was no discontinuity at the 2nd learning rate reduction).\n\nUnfortunately I don't think I can recommend to accept this paper as it was too un-clearly explained.  I think the authors should try to get the involvement of someone with more machine learning experience who might be able to solidify their ideas.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
