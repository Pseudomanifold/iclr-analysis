{"title": "In this paper, a new method was proposed to improve performance of batch normalization methods.", "review": "There are three major problems with the paper;\n\n1. The novelty of the paper is not sufficient since it is an incremental work on batch normalization (BN). In  addition, there are various similar approaches such as hypernetworks, SE-Net, statistical filtering etc. used for similar purposes.\n\n2. Experimental analyses are not sufficient. First, you should compare the proposed method both conceptually and experimentally with the above mentioned methods in detail. Second, you should also compare the results with recent BN methods such as switchable normalization. Third, you should provide the results for other types of DNNs and datasets.\n\n3. There are too many grammatical problems and typo in the paper, some which are addressed below;\n\nPlease define feature map more precisely. Is it vector, matrix etc? Please also define mean, variance etc. appropriately.\n\nPlease define weight and bias precisely. What does \\times used in (2) for \\omega \\times x_s denote?\n\nWhat do you mean by \u201clow association-quality\u201d? Please explain the terms \u201clow association-quality\u201d, \u201cinformation loss\u201d, \u201cdata flow\u201d, \u201cbottleneck\u201d etc. more precisely.\n\nPlease explain how you partition feature maps into N groups in detail.\n\nIs equation (4) complete? What does { denote?\n\n", "rating": "2: Strong rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
