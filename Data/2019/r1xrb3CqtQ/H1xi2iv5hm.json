{"title": "A two-step solution for heterogeneous domain transfer (e.g., image-to-audio)", "review": "In this paper, the authors study an interesting problem, i.e., heterogeneous domain transfer such as knowledge transfer between an image domain and a speech/audio domain. In particular, the proposed solution contains two major steps: (i) pre-train each domain via VAE or GAN, and (ii) train a conditional VAE in semi-supervised manner in order to bridge two domains (see Section 2.2). Experiments on three public datasets (including three cross-domain settings) show the effectiveness of the proposed two-step solution.\n\nSome Comments/suggestions:\n(i) The technical novelty (considering the two-step solution) is limited though the studied problem is very interesting.\n\n(ii) The authors are suggested to put the proposed solution in the context of transfer learning, which may better show the significance of this work. Currently, such a discussion and comparison is missing.\n\n(iii) There are many grammar errors throughout the whole paper. The authors are suggested to significantly improve the linguistic quality.\n\n(iv) A section of Conclusions is missing.\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
