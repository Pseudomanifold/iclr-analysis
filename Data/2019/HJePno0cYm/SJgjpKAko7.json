{"title": "Marginal innovation", "review": "This paper puts forward a new schema for language modeling, especially for relationship between two parts far apart.\n\nThe experimental results on WikiText-103 are good, improving the STOA PPL by 9.0. On the other three datasets, however, there's little or no gain. The speed comparison should be carried out over more LM models, as Al-Rfou is not the fastest.\n\nThe writing is not very clear, especially around equations.\n\nOverall the contribution of this paper is marginally incremental:\n1. The major proposed idea is just to add one no-grad previous segment into the prediction for next segment. This is similar to Residual network idea but more simplified.\n2. Using relative positional encoding is not a new idea, e.g. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02155.pdf.\n3. Reusing previous level/segment computation with gradient fixed is also not a big innovation.\n\ntypo:\n1. end of page 3, and \"W.\" denotes\".\n2.
