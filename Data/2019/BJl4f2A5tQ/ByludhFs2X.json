{"title": "The idea of the paper is interesting and it is valuable to share negative results but it would be beneficial if the paper would focus more on hypothesis evaluation in a more constraint environment.", "review": "This paper proposes to learn a dynamics model (state to pixels using Generative Adversarial Networks), use this model in conjunction with Monte Carlo Tree Search, model-free reinforcement learning (Q-learning) and a reward prediction network essentially combining model-free with model-based learning. The proposed approach is empirically evaluated on a small subset of the Atari games and theoretical analysis for the bias-variance tradeoff are presented.\n\nIt is highly appreciated that this paper presents an idea and discusses why the proposed approach does not result in high performance. This is very valuable and useful for the community. On a high level it would be very useful if Figure 1 would be show less examples but present them much larger since it is almost impossible to see anything in a printout. Further, the caption does not lend itself to understand the figure. Similarly Figure 2 would benefit from a better caption. \n\nThe first part of the discussion (7), the individual building blocks, should be mentioned much earlier in the paper. It would be further useful to add more related work on that abstraction level. This would help to communicate the main contribution of this paper very precisely.\n\nOn the discussion of negative results: It is very interesting that Dyna-Q does not improve the performance and the hypothesis for why this is the case seems reasonable. Yet, it would be very useful to actually perform an experiment in a better controlled environment for which e.g. the dynamics model is based on the oracle and assess the empirical effect of different MCTS horizons and rollout estimates. Further, this scenario would allow to further quantify the importance and the required \u201cquality\u201d of the different learning blocks.\n\nIn its current form the paper has theoretical contributions and experimental results which cannot be presented in the main paper due to space constraints. Albeit the appendix is already very extensive it would be very useful to structure it into the theoretical derivation and then one section per experiment with even more detail on the different aspects of the experiment. The story of the main paper would benefit from referencing the negative results more briefly and better analyzing the different hypothesis on toy like examples. Further, the introduction could be condensed in order to allow for more in detail explanations and discussions without repetition later on.\n\nAs argued in the paper it is clear that image generation is a very expensive simulation mechanism which for games like pong which depend on accurate modeling of small aspects of the image are in itself difficult. Therefore, again although really appreciated, the negative results should be summarized in the main paper and the hypothesis concluded better analyzed. The extensive discussion of hyper parameters and approaches for individual components could be in the appendix and the main paper focuses on the hypothesis analysis.\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}
