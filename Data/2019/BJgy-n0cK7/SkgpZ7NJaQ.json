{"title": "Interesting idea but need further clarified ", "review": "In this paper, the authors propose a novel segmentation scheme that combines the block motion vectors for feature warping, bi-directional propagation, and feature fusion. Experiments demonstrate its effectiveness compared with alternative methods. However, I still have several concern:\n1. As  the block motion vectors are generally rough estimation, it may damage the performance of the tasks. The authors should further clarify how the imperfect estimation influence the performance, e.g., the Blocking artifacts. \n2. The features are actually abstract representation of an image while the motion vectors are actually obtained via the pixel comparison. The authors should further justify the motion estimation could be used to the latent feature directly. \n3.  The authors are expected to conduct more comprehensive experiments. Motion vectors are consistent in the current dataset. The authors are expected to demonstrate when the motion are chaotic. \n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
