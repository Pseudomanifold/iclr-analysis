{"title": "Robust Determinantal Generative Classifier for Noisy Labels and Adversarial Attacks", "review": "Quality: A simple approach accompanied with a theoretical justification and large number of experimental results. The theoretical justification is spread out in the main body and appendices. The proof given in the appendix is overly short and not detailed enough. The large number of experiment although welcoming needs to be properly discussed and related to the state of the art numbers, including any work that the authors are referring themselves in this submission. The approach is not linked to so called Tandem approach that was/is popular in speech recognition where a generative model (GMM) is trained on top of features extracted by a neural network model. \n\nClarity: The simple approach is clearly described. However, the theoretical justification and experimental results are not.\n\nOriginality: The work is moderately original.\n\nSignificance: It is hard to assess given the current submission. \n", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
