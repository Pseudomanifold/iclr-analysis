{"title": "Interesting paper but still lack of novelty", "review": "The paper point that the dropout in training is equivalent to MAP estimate of hierarchical models when the prior distribution of weights, \\Theta, is a zero mean Gaussian. Based on that observation the authors propose several different evaluation methods for dropout. The experimental results show that the proposed evaluation methods improved the performance of language models.\n\nAre there any experimental results of the proposed evaluation methods for another type of data beyond language modeling?\n\nDo the term \"deterministic dropout\" in the last sentence of the first paragraph on page 1 and the one in Sec 3 (the first bullet) refer to the same thing? \n\nMinor: gaussian -> Gaussian", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}
