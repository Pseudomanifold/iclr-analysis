{"title": "Cool Idea but concerns about experiments", "review": "The authors combined several update steps together to achieve aggregated momentum. They showed that  it is more stable than the other momentum methods. Also, in Auto-encoder and image classification, AggMo outperforms than the other methods. \n\nPros:\n(+) Theoretical result is shown on the quadratic problem.\n\n(+) Extensive numerical experiments are shown to illustrate the stability of AggMo.\n\nCons:\n(+) The results are not convincing. For example, it said in the default setting (CM \\beta=0.9), ResNet34 on CIFAR-10 has accuracy 90.22\\%. However, it should be around 93\\%.\n\n(+)  This method is similar to multi-step gradient methods.\n\n\n\nComments:\n(+) This is no \u201cintroduction\u201d in the paper. \n\n(+) There should be \u201c,\u201d after mathematical equations. \n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
