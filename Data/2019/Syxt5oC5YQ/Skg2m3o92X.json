{"title": "Nice algorithm that is simple yet effective and has good intuition", "review": "The paper introduces a variant of momentum that aggregates several velocities with different dampening coefficients. The proposed optimization algorithm can significantly decrease oscillation thus one can use much larger dampening coefficient to achieve faster convergence.\n\nThe paper does a good job of motivating the algorithm, both in terms of intuitive reasoning from physics, and some demonstrative examples. The paper also has nice analysis in the simple quadratic case where it tries to make equivalence to the Nesterov's accelerated gradients.\n\nThe experiments are also thorough and convincing since it contains various network architectures and different datasets. From the comparison, it seems AggMo consistently achieves the best or comparable performance even in test error/accuracies.\n\nThe connection to Nesterov's accelerated gradient and extragradient methods can be discussed in more details. It'll be nice to put the theoretical results in the main text as well.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
