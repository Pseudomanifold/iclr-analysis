{"title": "Interesting but incremental", "review": "This paper proposed an aggregated momentum methods for gradient based optimization. The basic idea is instead of using a single velocity vector, multiple velocity vectors with different damping factors are used in order to improve the stability.\n\nIn term of novelty, the proposed method seems quite incremental. Using multiple velocity vectors seems interesting but not surprising, There is no theoretical guideline how to determine the number of velocity vectors and how to choose the damping factors. \n\nI would also suggest that authors should put some main theoretical results like the convergence analysis to the main paper instead of the appendix. \n\nIn terms of the clarity, I think the paper is well written and the experiments are sufficient and convincing.\n\nOne minor question is: what is \\lambda in Fig. 1?\n\n ", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
