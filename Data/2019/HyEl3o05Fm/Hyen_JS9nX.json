{"title": "Straightforward paper and simple extension of VAE-GANs", "review": "This paper proposes to extend VAE-GAN from the static image generation setting to the video generation setting. It\u2019s a well-written, simple paper that capitalizes on the trade-off between model realism and diversity, and the fact that VAEs and GANs (at least empirically) tend to lie on different sides of this spectrum.\n\nThe idea to extend the use of VAE-GANs to the video prediction setting is a pretty natural one and not especially novel. However, the effort to implement it successfully is commendable and will, I think, serve as a good reference for future work on video prediction. \n\nThere are also several interesting design choices that I think are worth of further exposition. Why, for example, did the authors only perform variational inference with the current and previous frames? Did conditioning on additional frames offer limited further improvement? Can the blurriness instead be attributable to the weak inference model? Please provide a response to these questions. If the authors have any ablation studies to back up their design choices, that would also be much appreciated, and will make this a more valuable paper for readers.\n\nI think Figure 5 is the most interesting figure in the paper. I would imagine that playing with the hyperparameters would allow one to traverse the trade-off between realism and diversity. I think having such a curve will help sell the paper as giving the practitioner the freedom to select their own preferred trade-off. \n\nI don\u2019t understand the claim that \u201cGANs prioritize matching joint distributions of pixels over per-pixel reconstruction\u201d and its implication that VAEs do not prioritize joint distribution matching. VAEs prioritize matching joint distributions of pixels and latent space: min KL(q(z, x) || p(z, x)) and is a variational approximation of the problem min KL(q(x) || p(x)), where q(x) is the data distribution. The explanation provided by the authors is thus not sufficiently precise and I recommend the retraction of this claim.\n\nPros:\n+ Well-written\n+ Natural extension of VAE-GANs to video prediction setting\n+ Establishes a good baseline for future video prediction work\nCons:\n- Limited novelty\n- Limited analysis of model/architecture design choices", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
