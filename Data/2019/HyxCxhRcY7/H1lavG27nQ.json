{"title": "A comprehensive study of an intuitive idea for anomaly detection. Can benefit from a restructuring of the writing.", "review": "This paper proposes fine-tuning an out-of-distribution detector using an Outlier Exposure (OE) dataset. The novelty is in proposing a model-specific rather than dataset-specific fine-tuning. Their modifications are referred to as Outlier Exposure. OE includes the choice of an OE dataset for fine-tuning and a regularization term evaluated on the OE dataset. It is a comprehensive study that explores multiple datasets and improves dataset-specific baselines.\n\nSuggestions and clarification requests:\n- The structure of the writing does not clearly present the novel aspects of the paper as opposed to the previous works. I suggest moving the details of model-specific OE regularization terms to section 3 and review the details of the baseline models. Then present the other set of novelties in proposing OE datasets in a new section before presenting the results. Clearly presenting two sets of novelties in this work and then the results. If constrained in space, I suggest squeezing the discussion, conclusion, and 4.1.\n- In the related work section Radford et al., 2016 is references when mentioning GAN. Why not the original reference for GAN?\n- Maybe define BPP, BPC, and BPW in the paragraphs on PixelCNN++ and language modeling or add a reference.\n- Numbers in Table 3 column MSP should match the numbers in Table 1, right? Or am I missing something?", "rating": "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
