{"title": "GANs for OT and OT for GANs", "review": "The paper proposes W2GAN, a GAN where the objective function relies on a W2 distance. Authors state that the discriminator approximate the W2 distance, and that the generator follows an OT map. \nWhile I did not see any flaws in the development, the paper is quite bushy and hard to follow. Some questions are still open, for instance in the end of the experiments, authors state that the model has \"a strong theoretical advantages\": can you provide more details about those advantages?\nThe experiments do not show any clear advantages of the method regarding competitors. Regarding Table 1, why are there some points with no arrows? W2-OT seems not to perform better: are there some other advantages (computational?) to use the method? In Figure 1, it is quite difficult to evaluate the results on a single image with no comparisons. Again, providing a strong evaluation of the method would help to strengthen the paper. \n\nThere are some weird statements and typos mistakes that should be corrected. For example in the first 2 pages: (abstract) \"other GANs also approximately following the Optimal Transport\", (Introduction) \"An optimal map has many important implications such as computing barycenters\", \"high-dimenisonal\", \"generator designed\", \"consideral\", \"although the theoretical arguments do not scale immediately\".\nThe layout of the bibliography should be deeply reviewed.\n\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
