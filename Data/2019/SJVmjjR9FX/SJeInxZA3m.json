{"title": "A novel well executed paper", "review": "This paper is well written, appears to be well executed, and the results look good. I am not particularly well informed about the area, but the work appears to be novel. MCMC for phylogenetic inference is hugely expensive, and anything we can do to reduce that cost would be beneficial (the computational expense is not given, or I've missed it, for the variational approach - presumably it is relatively small compared to MCMC?).\n\nMy main criticism is that I found the details of subsplit Bayesian networks difficult to follow. Googling them suggests they are a relatively new model, which has not been well studied or used (there are no citations of the paper that introduces them for example!). The paper would be stronger if it discussed these in more detail - how close can they come to approximating the models usually used in phylogenetic analyses? Often the inferred phylogeny is itself of interest - how similar are the trees inferred here to those found from MrBayes?", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess"}
