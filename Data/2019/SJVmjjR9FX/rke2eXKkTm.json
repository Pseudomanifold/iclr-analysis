{"title": "A nice approach to inferring phylogenetic trees", "review": "This paper proposes a variational approach to Bayesian posterior inference in phylogenetic trees. The novel part of the approach (using subsplit Bayesian networks as a variational distribution) is intelligently combined with recent ideas from the approximate-inference literature (reweighted wake-sleep, VIMCO, reparameterization gradients, and multiple-sample ELBO estimators) to yield what seems to be an effective approach to a very hard inference problem.\n\nMy score would be higher were it not for two issues:\n* The paper is 10 pages long, and I'm not convinced it needs to be. The reviewer guidelines (https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2019/Reviewer_Guidelines) say that \"the overall time to read a paper should be comparable to that of a typical 8-page conference paper. Reviewers may apply a higher reviewing standard to papers that substantially exceed this length.\" So I recommend trying to cut it down a bit during the revision phase.\n* The empirical comparisons are all likelihood/ELBO-based. These metrics are important, but it would be nice to see some kind of qualitative summary of the inferences made by different methods\u2014two methods can produce similar log-likelihoods or KL divergences but suggest different scientific conclusions.\n\nOne final comment: it's not clear to me that ICLR is the most relevant venue for this work, which is purely about Bayesian inference rather than deep learning. This isn't a huge deal\u2014certainly there's plenty of variational inference at ICLR these days\u2014but I suspect many ICLR attendees may tune out when they realize there aren't any neural nets in the paper.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
