{"title": "official review for \"Generative Adversarial Networks for Extreme Learned Image Compression\"", "review": "This paper proposed an interesting method using GANs for image compression. The experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrated the proposed method can significantly outperform baselines. \n\nThere are a few questions for the authors:\n\n1.The actually benefit from GAN loss: the adversarial part usually can benefit the visual quality but is not necessary related to image quality (e.g. SSIM, PSNR).  \n\n2.The novelty of the model: GAN models with multiple G-Ds or local/global discriminators is not novel (see the references).\n\n3.Do you have ablation study on the effects of conditional GAN and compression part to the model? \n\nReferences: \na. Xi et al. Pedestrian-Synthesis-GAN: Generating Pedestrian Data in Real Scene and Beyond \nb. Yixiao et al. FD-GAN: Pose-guided Feature Distilling GAN for Robust Person Re-identification\n\nRevision: the rebuttal can not address my concerns, especially the image quality assessment and the novelty of the paper parts. I will keep my original score but not make strong recommendation to accept the paper.
