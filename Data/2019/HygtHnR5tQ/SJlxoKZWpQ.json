{"title": "Impressive results, but some details unclear", "review": "This paper proposed GAN-based framework for image compression and show improved results over several baseline methods. Although the approach is not very novel by itself, the adaption and combination of existing methods for the proposed solution is interesting. Although the bpp are consistently lower, the quality metrics used for comparison seem unclear.\n\n\nPros:\n+ The reported compression results with a GAN-based framework for large images are impressive\n+ Comprehensive set of results with Kodak, RAISE1K and Cityscapes datasets\n+ The paper is well written with the core results and idea being well articulated\n\n\nCons:\n+ Primary concern:  The quality metrics are unclear esp. for GC models, since traditional metrics such MS-SSIM and PSNR are noted to worse and primarily visual inspection is used for comparison, making it less concrete. Would also to help include these metrics for comparison\t\n+ Eqn6: \\lamda balancing the distortion between GAN loss and entropy terms - can the authors elaborate on this ? Furthermore, the ensuing statement that the addition of the distortion term, results in acting like a regularizer - seems like only a conjecture, can the authors additionally comment on this as well. \n\n\nMinor issues:\n+ The comparison of improvement in compression is reported using relative percentage numbers in some places as the improvement and others as lack of therein. It would help to use a common reporting notation throughout the text, this helps readability/understandability ", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
