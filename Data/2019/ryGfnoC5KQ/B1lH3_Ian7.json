{"title": "limited empirical evidence", "review": "The paper proposes an alternative to backprop through time for\ntraining RNN models.\n\nThe paper is reasonably well written, but somewhat dense and hard\nto follow.  The contribution seems novel.\n\nThe main issue is the empirical evaluation.  All of the tasks\n(masked addition, pixel-by-pixel MNIST, and the AnBn problem)\nare artificial.\n\nIn addition, the results on some of the tasks are mixed if not\nin favor of BPTT.  I am not convinced that these results are enough\nto showcase the practical advantages of KeRL.\n\nI am willing to increase my score, if the authors address this\nissue.\n\nDetailed comments:\n\n- The authors mention that BPTT is not biologically plausible.  Although\n  reasonable, I don't get why this would be an argument against it.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess"}
