{"title": "The paper violates the double blind review policy", "review": "First of all, the paper cannot be accepted because it violates the double blind submission policy by including an acknowledgments section.\n\nNonetheless, I will give some brief comments:\n\n The paper proposes a probabilistic hierarchical approach to perform zero-shot learning.\nInstead of directly optimizing the standard cross-entropy loss, the paper considers some soft probability scores that consider some class graph taxonomy.\n\n The experimental section of the paper is strong enough although more baselines could have been tested. The paper only compares the usual cross entropy loss with their proposed soft-classification framework. \nNonetheless, different architectures of neural networks are tested on ImageNet and validate the fact that the soft probability strategy improves performance on the zero-shot learning task.\n\n \nOn the other hand, the theoretical aspect is weak. The proposed method seems to be a straightforward extension of Frome et al., NIPS 2013. The main contribution is that soft probability scores are used to perform classification instead of using only class membership information.\n\nSome weighting strategy is proposed in Section 2.2 but the proposed steps seem very ad hoc with no theoretical justification. The first equation on page 8 has the same problem where some random definition is provided.\n", "rating": "2: Strong rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
