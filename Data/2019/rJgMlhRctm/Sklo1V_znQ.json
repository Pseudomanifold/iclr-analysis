{"title": "Excellent paper including many cutting edge techniques ", "review": "The paper is well written and flow well. The only thing I would like to see added is an elaboration of \n\"run a semantic parsing module to translate a question into an executable program\". How to do semantic parsing is far from obvious. This topic needs at least a paragraph of its own. \n\nThis is not a requirement but an opportunity, can you explain how counting work? I think you have it at the standard level of the magic of DNN but some digging into the mechanism would be appreciated. \n\nIn concluding maybe you can speculate how far this method can go. Compositionality? Implicit relations inferred from words and behavior? Application to video with words?
