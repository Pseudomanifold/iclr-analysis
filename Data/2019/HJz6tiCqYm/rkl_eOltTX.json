{"title": "It is an importance work for deep learning research.", "review": "This paper introduces two benchmarks for image classifier robustness, ImageNet-C and Image-P. The benchmarks cover two important cases in classifier robustness  which are ignored by most current researchers. The authors' evaluations also show that current deep learning methods have wide room for improvement. To our best knowledge, this is the first work that provides systematically a common benchmarks for the deep learning community.  The reviewer believes that these two benchmarks can play an important role in the research of image classifier robustness.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
