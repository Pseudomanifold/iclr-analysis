{"title": "A natural place to incorporate deep learning", "review": "The authors state a clear summary of their contribution to Slow Feature Analysis (SFA) in Section 5: \"The key idea for gradient-based SFA is that a whitening layer can be applied subsequently to any differentiable architecture (such as deep neural networks) to enforce outputs that approximately obey the SFA constraints while still being a differentiable architecture.\u201d As a result, the proposed method can replace the previous SFA pipeline of [fixed, non-linear feature extraction + learned linear feature extraction] with simply end-to-end [learned, non-linear feature extraction]. The resulting method is thus more flexible and expressive and less hand-crafted than traditional SFA approaches. The paper shows experiments that validate that the method can learn meaningful representations in practice.\n\nThe writing is difficult to follow, unclear in several places, and has grammatical mistakes. As a result, it is more challenging to understand the proposed method, its motivation, and its precise place among related literature. For example, the authors discuss SpIN, and from that discussion, it seems that SpIN are quite similar; SpIN was submitted to arXiv 3-4 months before the ICLR deadline and thus is not concurrent as the authors claim (on my understanding, from reading the ICLR and other ML conference guidelines).\n\nThe approach does seem somewhat incremental, though I would be open to changing my mind on author response. On one view, this method can be seen as simply replacing SFA\u2019s fixed, non-linear feature extraction with learned non-linear feature extraction, with a trick to make it work. Deep learning consistently improves over fixed non-linear feature extractors, so it is not surprising a surprising place to incorporate neural networks.\n\nBased on the method, this paper could go either way, but given my concerns on its novelty and writing quality/clarity, I lean slightly towards reject.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}
