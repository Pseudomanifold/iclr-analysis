{"title": "Strong empirical results and well written", "review": "In this paper, authors proposed a so-called FLOWQA for conversational question answering (CoQA). Comparing with machine reading comprehension (MRC),  CoQA includes a conversation history. Thus, FLOWQA makes use of this property of CoQA and adds an additional encoder to handle this. It also includes one classifier to handle with no-answerable questions.\n\nPros:\nThe idea is pretty straightforward which makes use of the unique property of CoQA.\n\nResults are strong, e.g., +7.2 improvement over current state-of-the-art on the CoQA dataset. \n\nThe paper is well written.\n\nCons:\nIt is lack of detailed analysis how the conversation history affects results and what types of questions the proposed model are handled well.\n\nLimited novelty. The model is very similar to FusionNet (Huang et al, 2018) with an extra history encoder and a no-answerable classifier. \n\nQuestions:\nOne of simple baseline is to treat this as a MRC task by combining the conversation history with documents. Do you have this result?\n\nThe model uses the full history. Have you tried partial history? What's the performance? \n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
