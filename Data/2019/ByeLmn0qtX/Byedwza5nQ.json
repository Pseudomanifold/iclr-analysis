{"title": "Unclear contribution", "review": "- To this reviewer\u2019s understanding, the proposed method is very similar or equal to the conditional VAE. The only difference comes from the way of involving the condition information during training.\u0000 This should be clarified and further, it is necessary to compare with the conditional VAE in the experiments, rather than the vanilla VAE.\n\n- The proposed method uses a predefined and fixed value of the variance $\\sigma^{2}$, which is very informative and should be estimated from data in inference. Basically, there is no specification on this value in their experiments.\n\n- In a similar perspective, how the results changes according to the variation of the value $\\sigma$.\n\n- It is not intuitive how significant the improvement of 5% in PIS. It would be good to provide the intuitive understanding of the improvement.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
