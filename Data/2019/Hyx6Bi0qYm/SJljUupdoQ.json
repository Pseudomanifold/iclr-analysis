{"title": "ways to deal with nonstationarity in BCIs", "review": "The paper considers invasive BMIs and studies various ways to avoid daily recalibration due to changes in the brain signals. \nWhile I like the paper and studied methods -- using adverserial domain adaptation is interesting to use in this context --, I think that the authors oversell a bit. \nThe problem of nonstationarity rsp. stability is an old one in non-invasive BCIs (shenoy et al JNE 2006 was among the first) and a large number of prior methods have been defined to robustify feature spaces, to project to stable subspaces etc. Clearly no Gans at that time. The least the authors could do is to make reference to this literature, some methods may even apply also for the invasive data of the paper.\nWhile the authors did not clearly say that they present an offline analysis; one method, the GAN, gets 6% better results then the competitors. I am not sure whether this is practically relevant in an online setting. But this needs to be clearly discussed in the paper and put into perspective  to avoid wrong impression. Only an online study would be convincing. \n\nOverall, I think the paper could be accepted, the experiments are nice, the data is interesting, if it is appropriately toned down (avoiding statements about having done something for the first time) and properly references to prior work are given. It is an interesting application domain. I additionally recommend releasing the data upon acceptance. \n\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
