{"title": "Review of adversarial domain adaptation for stable brain-machine interfaces", "review": "This contribution describes a novel approach for implanted brain-machine interface in order to address calibration problem and covariate shift. A latent representation is extracted from SEEG signals and is the input of a LTSM trained to predict muscle activity. To mitigate the variation of neural activities across days, the authors compare a CCA approach, a Kullback-Leibler divergence minimization and a novel adversarial approach called ADAN.\n\nThe authors evaluate their approach on 16-days recording of neurons from the motor cortex of rhesus monkey, along with EMG recording of corresponding the arm and hand. The results show that the domain adaptation from the first recording is best handled with the proposed adversarial scheme. Compared to CCA-based and KL-based approaches, the ADAN scheme is able to significantly improve the EMG prediction, requiring a relatively small calibration dataset.\n\nThe individual variability in day-to-day brain signal is difficult to harness and this work offers an interesting approach to address this problem. The contributions are well described, the limitation of CCA and KL are convincing and are supported by the experimental results. The important work on the figure help to provide a good understanding of the benefit of this approach.\n\nSome parts could be improved. The results of Fig. 2B to investigate the role of latent variables extracted from the trained autoencoder are not clear, the simultaneous training could be better explained. As the authors claimed that their method allows to make an unsupervised alignment neural recording, independently of the task, an experiment on another dataset could enforce this claim.", "rating": "9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
