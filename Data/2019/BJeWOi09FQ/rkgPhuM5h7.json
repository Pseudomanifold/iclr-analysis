{"title": "paper seems well written and novel.", "review": "The authors present a model for semantic segmentation. The proposed method casts the full image segmentation as a sequence of local segmentation predictions. The image is split in multiple patches and processed sequentially in some order. A shared memory allows the local patch predictions to propagate information to improve other patch predictions which is necessary for resolving ambiguities.  They show a set of results on an XRay segmentation dataset with a reasonable ablation and baseline study. As well as a somewhat unclear result on image completion. The paper is well written, mostly clear and novel to the best of my knowledge.\n\npros:\n- semantic segmentation is clearly very important problem with many applications\n- the method seems clean and promising\ncons:\n- the segmentation community is much more familiar with MS-COCO and VOC. I think results on those datasets will make the paper much more impactful and clear any doubts about the method.\n- it is not clear what processing order the patches are processed in. Does that matter ? This should be clearer in the paper.\n- there is a brief mention of multiple actors but it seems to me its just one Bi-MANN actor is that true ? \n- sec. 4.2 is very surprising to me. From what is written I understand that an MNIST classifier is trained on the original MNIST dataset and that it still works to 56% on the test set with the bottom blanked out. Is that correct ? What architecture is this ? Also I find it very surprising that you can recover accuracy to 96% without seeing the trained classifier at all. Anything that can help me understand how that is possible would be appreciated. Are you aware of anyone else matching these results in the literature ?", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
