{"title": "An information theoretical approach for novel multi-target domain adaptation, but not well justified.", "review": "This paper investigates multi-target domain adaptation which is an unexplored domain adaptation scenario compared with adapting single/multiple source to single target. A mutual information-based loss is proposed to encourage part of the features to be domain-specific while the other part to be domain-invariant. Instead of optimizing the proposed loss which is intractable, this work proposes to use neural network to model the relative functions and optimize proposed loss\u2019 lower bound by SGD.\n\nMethod: \nThe proposed loss has an explanation from information theory, which is nice. However, the proposed loss is a combination of 4 different mutual information. The effectiveness of each one is unclear. An ablation study should be provided. \n\nClarity: The presentation should be improved, especially in the descriptions for experiments. \n- Typo: Section 4: TanH should be Tanh\n- Duplicated reference: Konstantinos Bousmalis, Nathan Silberman, David Dohan, Dumitru Erhan, and Dilip Krishnan. Unsupervised pixel-level domain adaptation with generative adversarial networks. In CVPR, July 2017a.\n\nResults: \n- I am confused by the experimental settings of MTDA-ITA, c-MTDA-ITA, and c-MTDA-ITA. s-MTDA-ITA. I understand c-MTDA-ITA is to combine all the target domains into a single one and train it using MTDA-ITA. And s-MTDA-ITA is to train multiple MTDA-ITA separately, where each one corresponds to a source-target pair. But I am confused by the MTDA-ITA results in both table 1 and table 2. Could the authors provide some explanation for MTDA-ITA?\n\n- For the metric in digits adaptation, the standard metric is classification accuracy. The authors use mean classification accuracy. Is this the mean of classification accuracy of multiple runs? If so, authors should provide the standard deviation. If this is the average per-class accuracy, this is different from standard routine in ADDA, CORAL, etc.\n\nConcerns: \nThe effectiveness of MDTA-ITA, s-MDTA-ITA and c-MDTA-ITA are not convincing. From the experiments, it seems the c-MDTA-ITA cannot provide convincing superior performance compared to c-ADDA and c-DTN.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
