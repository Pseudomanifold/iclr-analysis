{"title": "Could be an important contribution but not clear from the paper", "review": "The paper proposes a new post selection inference for MMD statistics, i.e., identity the p-values for the dimensions of vector. I believe this is an important problem that has not been addressed in previous literature. The work provides an extension to the original post selection inference work for lasso (Lee et al. 2016). \n\nHowever, I wish the paper could have explained the main idea clearly. Right now it is hard to me to judge whether or not the proposed estimator is correct (the only place that seems to support this is Fig. 4(a). Where the p-value seems to be clear to a uniform distribution. \n\nFor instance, the proposed PSI estimator, we will need to estimate the covariance matrix. This was explained in Section 3.3, and it was said that the algorithm in Fan et al. (2013) was used for the explanation. However, I think more detailed discussions and explanation should be provided here. In order to obtain correct p-value estimate, I believe getting accurate covariance matrix estimate is crucial. How large the sample size is needed, in order for us to get an accurate enough covariance matrix, to perform sub-sequent post selection inference? More discussions are needed here.
