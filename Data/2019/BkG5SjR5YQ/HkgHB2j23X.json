{"title": "develop post feature selection inference for incomplete mmd", "review": "The paper propose a method for post feature selection inference in the case where the distribution is non-Gaussian. The paper developed a statistic called incomplete mmd and showed its asymptotic normal property. Then the incomplete mmd can be plugged into post feature selection framework for computing the p-value. \n\nThe paper is a nice combination of incomplete mmd and post selection inference technique. \nHowever, the combination is straightforward: the asymptotic Gaussian property of the incomplete mmd is the key. \n\nFurthermore, I think the applications (feature selection and test for GAN objective) is not exciting from the machine learning point of view. A better application which can show-case the obtained p-value is very useful will make the paper more interesting.
