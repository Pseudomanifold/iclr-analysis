Therefore the introduction needs to be rewritten with arguing the difference between existing methods. \n\nThe proposed method highly relies on the percentage of implicitly aligned data. I suggest the author do more experiments on different data set with a significant difference in this \"percentage\". Otherwise, we have no idea about the performance's sensitivity to the different datasets. \n\nMore detailed explanations are needed. For example, what do you mean by \"p(w)  as the estimated frequency\"? Why do we need to remove the first principal components?\n\nSection 3.2 title is \" aligning topic distribution\" but actually it is doing word distribution alignment.\n\nDo you do normalization for P(w^Y;d_i^X,\\theta) in eq.6 which is defined on the entire vocab's distribution?\n\nI think the measurement of the alignment accuracy and more experiments with different settings of \\alpha and \\beta are needed.\n\nCitation needed for \"Second, many previous works suggest  that the word distribution ...\"\n\n[1] Munteanu et al, \"Improving Machine Translation Performance by Exploiting Non-Parallel Corpora\", 2006", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
