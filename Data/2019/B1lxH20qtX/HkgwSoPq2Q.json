{"title": "An interesting idea of dynamical \"self-assembly\" but unclear implications of the proposed message passing ", "review": "The paper describes training a collection of independent agents enabled with message passing to dynamically form tree-morphologies.  The results are interesting and as proof of concept this is quite an encouraging demonstration.\n\nMain issue is the value of message passing\n- Although the standing task does demonstrate that message passing may be of benefit. It is unclear in the other two tasks if it even makes a difference. Is grouping behavior typical in the locomotion task or it is an infrequent event?\n  - Would it be correct to assume that even without message passing and given enough training time the \"assemblies\" will learn to perform as well as with message passing? The graphs in the standing task seem to indicate this. Would you be able to explain and perform experiments that prove or disprove that?\n  - The videos demonstrate balancing in the standing task and it is unclear why the bottom-up and bidirectional messages perform equally well. I would disagree with your comment about lack of information for balancing in the top-down messages. The result is not intuitive.\n  - Given the above, does message passing lead to a faster training?  Would you be able to add an experimental evidence of this statement?", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
