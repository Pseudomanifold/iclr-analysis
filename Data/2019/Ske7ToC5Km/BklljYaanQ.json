{"title": "A good paper for the conference", "review": "Graph representation techniques are important as various applications require learning over graph-structured data. The authors proposed a novel method to embedding a graph as a vector. Compared to Graph Convolutions Neural Networks (GCNN), the proposed are able to handle directed graphs while GCNN can not. Overall the paper is good, the derivation and theory are solid. The authors managed to prove the proposed representation is somehow lossless, which is very nice. The experiment is also convincing.\n\nMy only concern is as follows. The authors claim that Eq. (1) is able to handle features on vertices or edges. However, in the current formulation, the evolution only depends on vertex features, thus how can it handle edge features?", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
