{"title": "An elegant solution to a long-standing open question as to the speed-up of asynchronous distributed coordinate descent", "review": "In distributed optimisation, it is well known that asynchronous methods outperform synchronous methods in many cases. However, the questions as to whether (and when) asynchronous methods can be shown to have any speed-up, as the number of nodes increases, has been open. The paper under review answers the question in the affirmative and does so very elegantly.\n\nI have only a few minor quibbles and a question. There are some recent papers that could be cited:\nhttp://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/zhou18b.html\nhttp://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/lian18a.html\nhttps://nips.cc/Conferences/2018/Schedule?showEvent=11368\nand the formatting of the bibliography needs to be improved. \n\nIn the synchronous case, some of the analyses extend to partially separable functions, e.g.:\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1406.0238\nand citations thereof. Would it be possible to extend the present work in that direction?", "rating": "9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
