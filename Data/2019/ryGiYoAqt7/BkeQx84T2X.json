{"title": "Barely any novelty", "review": "The paper proposes an augmentation of the DDPG algorithm with prioritized experience replay plus parameter noise. Empirical evaluations of the proposed algorithm are conducted on Mujoco benchmarks while the results are mixed.\n\nAs far as I can see, the paper contains almost no novelty as it crudely puts together three existing algorithms without presenting enough motivation. This can be clearly seen even from the structuring of the paper, since before the experimental section, only a short two-paragraph subsection (4.1) and an algorithm chart are devoted to the description of the main ideas. Furthermore, the algorithm itself is a just simple addition of well-known techniques (DDPG + prioritized experience replay + parameter noise) none of which is proposed in the current paper. Finally, as shown in the experimental sections, I don't see a evidence that the proposed algorithm consistently outperform the baseline.\n\nTo sum up, I believe the submission is below the novelty threshold for a publication at ICLR.", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
