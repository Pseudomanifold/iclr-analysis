{"title": "Reasonable methods but some unclear points", "review": "The paper design a low variance gradient for distributions associated with continuous or discrete random variables. The gradient is designed in the way to approximate the  property of reparameterization gradient.  The paper is comprehensive and includes mathematical details. \n\nI have following comments/questions\n\n1. What is the \\kappa in \u201cvariable-nabla\u201d stands for? What is the gradient w.r.t. \\kappa?\n\n2. In Eq(8), does the outer expectation w.r.t . y_{-v} be approximated by one sample? If so, it is using the local expectation method. How does that differs from Titsias & Lazaro-Gredilla(2015) both mathematically and experimentally? \n\n3. Assume y_v is M-way categorical distribution, Eq(8) evaluates f by 2*V*M times which can be computationally expensive. What is the computation complexity of GO? How to explain the fast speed shown in the experiments?\n\n4. A most simple way to reduce the variance of REINFORCE gradient is to take multiple Monte-Carlo samples at the cost of more computation with multiple function f evaluations. Assume GO gradient needs to evaluate f N times, how does the performance compared with the REINFORCE gradient with N Monte-Carlo samples? \n\n5. In the discrete VAE experiment, upon brief checking the results in Grathwohl(2017), it shows validation ELBO for MNIST as (114.32,111.12), OMNIGLOT as (122.11,128.20) from which two cases are better than GO. Does the hyper parameter setting favor the GO gradient in the reported experiments? Error bar may also be needed for comparison. What about the performance of GO gradient in the 2 stochastic layer setting in Grathwohl(2017)?\n\n6. The paper claims GO has less parameters than REBAR/RELAX. But in Figure 9, GO has more severe overfitting. How to explain this contradicts between the model complexity and overfitting?\n\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
