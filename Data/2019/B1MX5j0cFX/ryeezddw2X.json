{"title": "Interesting observations, but paper needs clarity in writing ", "review": "The paper presents some interesting observations related to the connection between the universal adversarial attacks on CNNs and spectral properties. While most of the results are empirical, the authors present two theorems to justify some of the observations. However, the paper is poorly written and very hard to read. Rather than providing too many plots/results in the main paper (maybe use supplementary matl.), the empirical results should be better explained to help the readers. Similarly, the implications of the theorems are not really clear and bit hand-wavy.    \n\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n\nIt seems that the authors provided a generic response to all the reviewers and I am not sure if they acknowledge the lack of clarity and lot of hand-wavy explanations in the paper. This issue has been raised by other reviewers too and is quite critical for becoming a good paper worthy for ICLR. Therefore, I am unable to update my score for this paper. However, I do appreciate the comparison with Moosavi-Dezfooli et al. (CVPR'17), this is a good addition as suggested by another reviewer.
