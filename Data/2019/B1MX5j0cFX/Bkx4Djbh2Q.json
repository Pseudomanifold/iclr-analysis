{"title": "An interesting observation, but the contribution is not significant enough", "review": "The authors made an interesting observation: There's an important common subspace of Gradient/FGSM/Deepfool attacks among all examples. Therefore, they propose to use top SVD components of the directions to conduct universal attack. This is an interesting finding but also not surprising; we know the gradient of loss function w.r.t input can be used for interpretability, and in MNIST examples they usually reveals some rough shape of the class. This is also observed in Figure 8-13 in this paper, and thus it makes sense that the gradient directions share a common subspace. Therefore I think this observation itself is not significant enough. \n\nUsing this for universal attack is interesting, however the experiments are not that convincing: \n\n1. To show this is a good way for universal attack, I think the authors should compare with previous work in (Moosavi-Dezfooli et al). \n\n2. All the experiments are on MNIST. How about cifar/ImageNet? \n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
