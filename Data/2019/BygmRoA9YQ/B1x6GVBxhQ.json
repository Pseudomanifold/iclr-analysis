{"title": "A  reasonable approach for noise robust training but there is a lack of novelty", "review": "The paper addresses the problem of training an object detection network that can achieve good performance on both clean and noisy images.   \nThe proposed approach is based on a gating network that decides whether\nthe image is clean or  noisy. in case of  noisy image a denoising  method is applied.  The network components form a mixture of experts architecture and are  jointly trained after a component-level pretraining.\nHow good is the gate performance? what happen if you use only one of the trained experts for all the clean/noisy  test data? It is not clear how you combined the results of the two experts. Are you computing a weighted average of the original and the enhanced images? Did you try to use a hard decision gating at test time? \n  ", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
