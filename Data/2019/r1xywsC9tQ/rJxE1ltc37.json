{"title": "Interesting problem, but contribution (and clarity) currently inadequate", "review": "This paper explores the notion of hyponymy in word vector representations. It tests the capacity of a logistic regression classifier to distinguish words that are and are not hyponyms using fastText embeddings, and it also describes a method of organizing WordNet relations into a tree structure and defining hyponymy based on this structure.\n\nThe problem of capturing hyponymy relations within vector space models of word representation is an interesting and important one, but it is not clear to me that this paper has made a substantive contribution to it. The paper seems simply to 1) observe that fastText embeddings are imperfect for hyponymy detection with a linear classifier, and 2) reconstruct the fairly natural interpretation of WordNet relations as a hierarchical tree structure, and to re-extract hyponymy relations from that tree structure. As far as I can tell, the paper's \u201csupervised\u201d model does not use embeddings  (or learning) at all.\n\nAssessing the paper's contribution is made more difficult by an overall lack of clarity. The details of the experiments are not laid out with sufficient explicitness, and the reporting of results is also fairly confusing (I am not clear, for example, on what is depicted in Figure 2). The paper is not organized in a particularly intuitive way, nor has it made clear what the contributions might be. \n\nOverall, while I think that this is a worthy topic, I do not think that the contribution or the clarity of this paper are currently sufficient for publication. \n\nAdditional comments:\n\n-The PCA plot is too dense to be a useful visual - it would be more useful to plot a smaller number of relevant points.\n\n-Results should be presented more clearly in table form - there seem to be a large number of results that are not reported in any table (for instance, the results described in Section 3).", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
