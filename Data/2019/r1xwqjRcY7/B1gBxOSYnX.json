{"title": "A simple extension of VAE", "review": "This paper proposes to replace the traditional KL term of VAE with the KL between two conditional distributions, which is to equip the model with the ability to address multimodal data. Moreover, the paper also extend the model to add an additional network to predict the label from the reconstructed image to enhance the decoder with supervised information. \n\nIn general, the model is contrived and the  novelty of the paper is incremental. Is Eq. 2 the ELBO of the new model? If so, the authors should provide the derivation of the ELBO. If not, can you prove the objective is the correct one to be optimized?\nMoreover, the model is just an trivial extension of VAE and all key techniques are borrowed from existing work (Chen et al. 2016).\n\nThe experiments are only conducted on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST, which is not sufficient. CIFAT10 should be at least added, and other more challenging benchmarks should also be considered to make the model more solid.\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
