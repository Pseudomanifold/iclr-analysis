{"title": "Review", "review": "The authors propose an extension of cycle-consistent adversarial adaptation methods in order to tackle domain adaptation in settings where a limited amount of supervised target data is available (though they also validate their model in the standard unsupervised setting as well). The method appears to be a natural generalization/extension of CycleGAN/CyCADA. It uses the ideas of the semantic consistency loss and training on adapted data from CyCADA, but \"fills out\" the model by applying these techniques in both directions (whereas CyCADA only applied them in the source-to-target direction).\n\nThe writing in this paper is a little awkward at times (many omitted articles such as \"the\" or \"a'), but, with a few exceptions, it is generally easy to understand what the authors are saying. They provide experiments in a variety of settings in order to validate their model, including both visual domain adaptation and speech domain adaptation. The experiments show that their model is effective both in low-resource supervised adaptation settings as well as high-resource unsupervised adaptation settings. An ablation study, provided in Section 4.1, helps to understand how well the various instantiations of the authors' model perform, indicating that enforcing consistency in both methods is crucial to achieving performance beyond the simple baselines.\n\nIt's a little hard to understand how this method stands in comparison to existing work. Table 3 helps to show that the model can scale up to the high-resource setting, but it would also be nice to see the reverse: comparisons against existing work run in the limited data setting, to better understand how much limited data negatively impacts the performance of models that weren't designed with this setting in mind.\n\nI would've also liked to see more comparisons against the simple baseline of a classifier trained exclusively on the available supervised target data, or with the source and target data together\u2014in my experience, these baselines can prove to be surprisingly strong, and would give a better sense of how effective this paper's contributions are. This corresponds to rows 2 and 3 of Table 1, and inspection of the numbers in that table shows that the baseline performance is quite strong even relative to the proposed method, so it would be nice to see these numbers in Table 2 as well, since that table is intended to demonstrate the model's effectiveness across a variety of different domain shifts.\n\nWhile it's nice that the model is experimentally validated on the speech domain, the experiment itself is not explained well. The speech experiments are hard to understand\u2014it's unclear what the various training sets are, such as \"Adapted Male\" or \"All Data,\" making it hard to understand exactly what numbers should be compared. Why is there no CycleGAN result for \"Female + Adapted Male,\" or \"All Data + Adapted Male,\" for example? The paper would greatly benefit from a more careful explanation and analysis of this experimental setting.\n\nUltimately, I think the idea is a nice generalization of previous work, and the experiments seem to indicate that the model is effective, but the limited scope of the experiments prevent me from being entirely convinced. The inclusion of additional baselines and a great deal of clarification on the speech experiments would improve the quality of this paper enormously.\n\n---\n\nUpdate: After looking over the additional revisions and experiments, I'm bumping this to a weak accept. I agree with reviewer 3 that novelty is not the greatest, but there is a useful contribution here, and the demonstration of its effectiveness on low resource settings is valuable, since in a practical setting it is usually feasible to manually label a few examples.\n\nI'm still not convinced by the TIMIT experiments, now that I better understand them, since the F+M baseline is quite strong and very simple to run. It simply doesn't seem worthwhile to introduce all of this extra machinery for such a marginal improvement, but the experiment does serve the job of at least demonstrating an improvement over existing methods.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
