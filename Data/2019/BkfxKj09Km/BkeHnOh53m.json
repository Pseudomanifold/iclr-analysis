{"title": "Interesting application domain, but no novelity in terms of methods; For a synthetic dataset, I would like to see the impact to real test data", "review": "This paper introduces a purely synthetic dataset for crystallography diffraction patterns. For this very specific application domain, this might be a very welcome approach, however, I feel the paper is not strong enough for ICLR for two reasons:\n\n1. The scope is too narrow for ICLR. Only a limited readership will be interested in this specific problem. Since the contribution is mainly on the dataset level and not on the methodological level, I suggest submitting such an article in venues more focused on the application domain. I can see no contribution which is general enough to be interesting for the broader readership. A new dataset might be of interest if it is a really challenging one where current approaches cannot yield high performance levels while it would be easy for domain experts to recognize.\n\n2. The experiments are only on synthetic data. I agree that synthetic data in general can be very useful, if generated correctly (this has been shown in many works). For a substantial article contribution, one should, however, in general add much more exhaustive experiments. Besides analyzing the behavior on synthetic data, one should perform tests on real data and see the influence of, e.g., pre-training on this synthetic dataset. Furthermore, comparison to pre-training on other datasets should be performed.
