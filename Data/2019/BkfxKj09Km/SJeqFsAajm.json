{"title": "The paper described a new open synthetic dataset for serial crystallography and compared three approach to classify these data. The paper is well written, clear and contribute an original dataset. The significance of the work need to be justified further by making comparison to real data. ", "review": "The paper describes a new open synthetic dataset for serial crystallography generated by a simulator. Three methods are proposed and implemented to demonstrate the classification of these diffraction images. The results from these methods are compared and clearly show the ones achieve high performance. The article structure is clear and is well written. The experiments are carried out in a professional way and statistical analysis is shown. It will be better if the authors can demonstrate how the models obtained from training the synthetic data perform in real scenario. Please also add some discussion on how good the synthetic data simulate the real data. Some image comparison between the synthetic data and real data should be analysed.
