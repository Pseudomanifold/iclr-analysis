{"title": "Improvement (maybe) of saliency maps by introducing technical improvements over previous work", "review": "This paper introduces a new saliency map extractor that seems to improve state-of-the-art results. Saliency maps are tools that can be useful to understand the decision-making of deep networks for object recognition; advances in this research topic may lead to a better understanding of the functioning of deep networks.\n\nThe paper is based on the approach of Fan et al. (2017). The improvements over Fan et al. seem to be mainly technical: the objective function and the optimization procedure. This makes the novelty of the paper quite thin, as the main underlying idea of the paper was previously introduced. \n\nThe algorithm is introduced without motivating well the different choices. What are the intuitions and evidence that guided the design of the algorithm? How are the technical choices made? Answers to these questions may help to understand how this paper builds on Fan et al. and other previous works.\n\nThe experiments compare a comprehensive set of algorithms and show an improvement over previous works. Yet, the OM metric is only compared for a few of these algorithms and it is unclear why is so. Also, the qualitative examples do not clarify how the proposed method improves over state-of-the-art (it would be useful to compare with qualitative examples of previous work). It remains unclear how much of an improvement over state-of-the-art there is.\n\nIn summary, I think the paper could be valuable as the proposed algorithm may improve state-of-the-art results. Yet, these results and the novelty of the paper are not entirely clear.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
