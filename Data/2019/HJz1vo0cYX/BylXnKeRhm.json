{"title": "Poorly written and confusing paper, albeit with an interesting and worthy aim", "review": "I was pleased to be assigned this paper as it sounded like a worthy aim and an interesting topic. However, having attempted to read it several times, I find it hard to take anything from the paper. My first criticism is that the English in the paper is poor, which makes it hard to follow. Take the following sentence from the abstract:\n \"We first analyze relation between variation of multiple model parameters for a single example inference and variance of the corresponding prediction scores by Bayesian modeling of stochastic regularization.\" Despite reading this multiple times I can't make sense of it. The paper is full of sentences such as this.\n\nI had expected the paper to make more of a link to the scoring rule literature given that this is where ideas about how to score predictions, ensuring calibration of predictions etc, has been developed. The Brier score and loglikelihood are used in the results, but the link is not made explicit. The use of the word 'calibration' in this paper is different to how it is used in the scoring rule literature, which is confusing (e.g. 'NLL and Brier score are another metrics for calibration' - whereas usually we'd talk about proper scoring rules, which these both are, as assessing some combination of calibration and sharpness, where these terms are given precise meanings).\n\nThe results, if I've understood them correctly, seem to be positive, but not stellar. A slight improvement is made on the baseline method, but the improvement is very minor.\n\n\n\n", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}
