{"title": "Unclear paper, difficult to understand how the algorithm works or why", "review": "The paper proposes a method whereby a neural network is trained and used as a data structure to assess approximate set membership. Unlike the Bloom filter, which uses hand-constructed hash functions to store data and a pre-specified method for answering queries, the Neural Bloom Filter learns both the Write function and the Read function (both are \"soft\" values rather than the hard binary values used in the Bloom filter). Experiments show that, when there is structure in the data set, the Neural Bloom Filter can achieve the same false positive rate with less space.\n\nI had a hard time understanding how the model is trained. There is an encoding function, a write function, and a query function. The paper talks about one-shot meta-learning over a stream of data, but doesn't make it clear how those functions are learned. A lot of details are relegated to the Appendix. For instance B.2 talks about the encoder architecture for one of the experiments. But even that does not contain much detail, and it's not obvious how this is related to one-shot learning. Overall, the paper is written from the perspective of someone fully immersed in the details of the area, but who is unable to pop out of the details to explain to people who are not already familiar with the approach how it works. I would suggest rewriting to give an end-to-end picture of how it works, including details, without appendices. The approach sounds promising, but the exposition is not clear at all.", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess"}
