{"title": "Interesting paper but requires additional experiments ", "review": "Ullman et al. showed that slight changes in location or size of visible regions in minimal recognizable images can significantly impair human ability to recognize objects. This paper is a  follow-up of Ullman et al. paper, with focus on sensitivity of DNNs to certain regions in images. In other words, slight change of such regions\u2019 size or location in the image can significantly affect DNN ability in recognizing them, even-though these changes are not noticeable for humans. \n\n\nComments and questions:\n\nThis paper provides in-depth study of fragile recognition in DNNs. \n\n- Visualizing activations of different layers of DNN for Loose shift/shrink FRIs can potentially provide more details on why the final output of DNN is significantly different for two visually similar images.   \n\n- Naively augmenting training data with crops of small FRI sizes can potentially harm and confuse DNN in classifying training samples as many small patches in training images are background and they don't contain target object. It is interesting to see the sensitivity of DNNs that are trained for the task of object detection to FRIs, like sensitivity of R-CNN to FRIs. In this case augmenting training data with crops of small FRI sizes can be properly done since ground-truth bounding boxes can determine which region is foreground and which region is background.
