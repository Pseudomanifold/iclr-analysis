{"title": "Interesting idea", "review": "The paper proposes a \u201crelativistic discriminator\u201d which has the property that the probability of real data being real decreases as the probability of fake data being real increases. \n\nThe paper is very well-written. I particularly liked Section 3 which motivates the key idea through multiple viewpoints. The experiments show that the relativistic discriminator helps in some settings, although it does seem a bit sensitive to hyperparameters, architectures and datasets.\n\nI found the argument about connections to IPM-GANs a bit confusing. In a couple of places in Section 4, the relativistic loss is motivated by showing that the relativistic discriminator makes SGANs more like IPM-GANs. However, not all IPM-GANs are the same, e.g. the experiments show performance gaps between RSGAN, RaSGAN, and WGAN-GP, which suggests there could be other confounding factors. \n\nCould you devise experiments on synthetic datasets where the different hypotheses in Section 3 might lead to different solutions? Would be very interesting to see which hypothesis best explains why relativistic discriminator helps!\n\nSection 4.3: How do you justify the averaging? While the relativistic GAN is well-explained, section 4.3 only briefly mentions the averaging idea. Given that averaging seems to help a lot in some of the experiments, it\u2019d be great to see further discussion of why this helps.\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
