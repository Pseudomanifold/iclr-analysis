{"title": "  Review: The relativistic Discriminator: A key element missing from standard GAN", "review": "\nIn this work, the authors considers a variation of GAN by consider simultaneously decrease the probability that real data is real for the generator. To include such a property, the authors propose a relativistic discriminator which estimate the probability that the given real data is more realistic than the fake data. Numerical results are performed to show that the proposed methods are effective, and the resulting GANs are relatively more stable and generate higher quality data samples than their non-relativistic counterparts.\n\nOverall the paper is well written and the rationale behind the proposed modification is clear. In particular, the authors use three different perspective, (the prior knowledge, the divergence minimization, and the gradient expressions), to explain what they thought is missing in the state-of-the-art. By proposing to utilize the information about both real and fake data in the discriminator definition, the authors\u2019 have (to some extent) alleviated the above shortcoming of the state-of-the-art.  Unfortunately, like almost all papers related to the field,  there has been no rigorously justification behind the proposed methods. \n\nThe English of the paper has to be significantly improved. For example, grammar errors like \u201cthis mean\u2026.\u201d, \u201cdidn\u2019t converge, \u2026\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, the codes of the paper is not released, I will encourage the authors to do so. \n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
