{"title": "No technical contribution, Heuristic solution", "review": "This paper proposed a way to detect a skew in the distribution of classes in a stream of images and reweight the class priors accordingly, to estimate the final posterior probabilities of present classes. This probability re-calibration is referred to as the probability layer. A simple algorithm is proposed to detect the class distribution skew. The proposed benefit of this method is that they do not require fine-tuning any network parameters using newly skewed data. \n\nOverall the method is quite simple and heuristic. The technical contribution - i) updating class priors online ii) detecting class skews, is marginal. \n\nThe evaluation is performed on a contrived setting of skewed imagenet images. I would have liked to see some evaluation on video stream data where the skews are more natural. \n\nIn real scenarios, the class specific appearances P_{X|Y}(x|i) as well as class distributions P_Y(i) change online. The method seems incapable to handle such problems.  In these situations, there is no simple fix, and one needs to resort to transfer.\n ", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
