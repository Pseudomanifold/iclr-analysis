", "review": "Paper summary: \n\nThis paper presents a deep-learning based method for super-resolving low-resolution labels into high-resolution labels given the joint distribution between those low- and high- resolution labels. This is useful for many semantic segmentation tasks where high-resolution ground truth data is hard and expensive to collect. Its main contribution is a novel loss function that allows to minimize the distance between the distribution determined by a set of model outputs and the corresponding distribution given by low-resolution label over the same set of outputs. The paper also thoroughly evaluates the proposed method for two main tasks, the first being a land cover mapping task and the second being a medical imaging problem.\n\nFor the land cover application, adding low-resolution data to high-resolution data worsens the results when evaluating on the geographic area from which the high-resolution data was taken. However, when testing the model on new geographic areas and only adding the low-resolution data from this new area in training makes significant improvements.\n\nGenerally the paper is very well written, well structured, all explanations are clear, examples and figures are presented when needed and convey helpful information for the reader. The overall idea is fun, original, useful (especially in remote sensing) and is presented in a a convincing way. All major claims are supported by experimental evaluation. There are nevertheless a few concerns:\n\nMajor Concerns:\n\nOn a conceptual level, the main concern is that the paper assumes we are given a joint distribution of low and high resolution labels, \u201cwhere we are given the joint distribution P(Y,Z)\u201d, which seems the main limitation of this method. In fact, to correctly estimat this joint distribution either requires additional knowledge about low-resolution data such as the example presented on the NCLD data : \u201cFor instance, the \u201cDeveloped, Medium Intensity\u201d class [...] of the coarse classes\u201d, or it requires actual high-resolution labelled data to correctly estimate this joint distribution. I think the paper would greatly benefit from including a section that discusses the impact of this limitation.\n\nAnother point is footnote 3 on page 5. This argument is valid but it would be more convincing to give a thorough explanation on why the choice of the presented loss function is better compared to the KL divergence based loss function or at least some evidence that the two perform similarly when evaluating the method.\n\nMinor Concerns: \n\n-\t\u201csuch as CRFs or iterative evaluation\u201d I would include a citation on this type of work.\n-\tFormat of some references in the text need to be corrected, e.g. \u201cinto different land cover classes Demir et al.
