{"title": "Improving the robustness of deep Networks by modeling the manifold of hidden representations is original, efficient and well motivated", "review": "The method works by substituting a hidden layer with a denoised version. \nNot only it enable to provide more robust classification results, but also to sense and suggest to the analyst or system when the original example is either adversarial or from a significantly different distribution.\nImprovements in adversarial robustness on three datasets are significant.\n\nBibliography is good, the text is clear, with interesting and complete experimentations.", "rating": "9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
