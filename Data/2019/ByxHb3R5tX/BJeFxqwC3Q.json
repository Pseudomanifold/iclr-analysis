{"title": "Interesting but not enough depth", "review": "I like the idea of Universal Successor Features, it seems a bit incremental but I think it is worth exploring. There is some missing aspects and better comparison that can be made for the paper. I believe for the final camera ready these comparisons should be added. Specifically the related work section seems to not be in a desired depth. \n\nFrom experiments perspective, there is sufficient experiments that can demonstrate the value of the model. It is a simple model but an elegant application and correctly used for the purpose of the tasks in the paper. I have the following questions which their answers may be good additions to the paper:\n\n1. Have you tried analyzing what successor features and goal-specific features learn? For example, one point of addressing this is: what does the agent seem to avoid or do, under your framework (but not normal DQN). \n2. The tasks in this paper seemed a bit simplistic, how does the model work on more complex applications (games)? It is hard to establish proper comparison, even though your claims are sufficiently supported. \n3. What is your explanation of cases where blue is under green? One could assume they would meet eventually like top-left in Figure 3. \n\nI strongly suggest a rewrite of the related works section and a redo of the graphics. Using PDF may help with odd aspect ratio for text (Fig 4).
