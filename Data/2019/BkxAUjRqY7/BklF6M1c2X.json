{"title": "new measure of transferability ", "review": "The paper proposes the H score H(f), a quantity that measure the goodness of feature f(x) for predicting some target y. This heavily builds on Makur et al. (2015) who introduce information vectors, the error exponent, and the DTM matrix. The paper connects H(f) with these quantities to justify the proposal (e.g., H(f) is proportional to the error exponent (Theorem 1)). The actual transferability is measured by the ratio between H(f) and H(f_opt) where the latter can be computed using the approach of Makur et al. \n\nThe question of how to determine the relevance of a source task for a target task without learning is an important one with lots of previous work. The proposed method seems to be novel and brings many interesting ideas in Makur et al. with empirical validation. One comment is that the paper imports heavily from Makur et al. but does not make the imported definitions and results as clear as they can be. I am still unsure of what exactly the error exponent is: its definition should probably be defined in the main paper.
