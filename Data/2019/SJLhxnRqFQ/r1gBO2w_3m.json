{"title": "ADVERSARIALLY LEARNED MIXTURE MODEL", "review": "The paper uses Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) for unsupervised and semi-supervised clustering. Neural network based generators are used for sampling using a mixture model. The parameters of the generators are optimised during training against a discriminator that tries to distinguish between generated distributions. Experimental results on MNIST and SVHN datasets are given to motivate their models.\n\nI am far from being an expert on GANs but just from a clustering viewpoint I can make the following comments about the paper:\n- Comparison with other clustering techniques is not present. How does error and computational efficiency compare with other techniques?\n- There doesn\u2019t seem to be any deep theoretical insight. This paper is more about using GANs in a particular way (different than the previously attempted ways) to study and demonstrate results. Once the model is decided so are the algorithms.\n- I am not sure what is the standard practice of describing the algorithms in the context of GANs. I found parsing Appendix A and B very difficult.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess"}
