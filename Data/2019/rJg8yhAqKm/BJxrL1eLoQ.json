{"title": "Potentially useful but poorly motivated and evaluated", "review": "The paper proposes a method of regularising goal-conditioned policies with a mutual information term. While this is potentially useful, I found the motivation for the approach and the experimental results insufficient. On top of that the presentation could also use some improvements. I do not recommend acceptance at this time.\n\nThe introduction is vague and involves undefined terms such as \"useful habits\". It is not clear what problems the authors have in mind and why exactly they propose their specific method. The presentation of the method itself is not self-contained and often relies on references to other papers to the point where it is difficult to understand just by reading the paper. Some symbols are not defined, for example what is Z and why is it discrete?\n\nThe experiments are rather weak, they are missing comparison to strong exploration baselines and goal-oriented baselines.", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
