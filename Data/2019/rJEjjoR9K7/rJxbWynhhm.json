{"title": "A domain generalization approach is introduced to reveal semantic (relevant) information based on a linear projection scheme from CNN and NGLCM ouput layers.", "review": "The paper is clear regarding motivation, related work, and mathematical foundations. The introduced cross-local intrinsic dimensionality- (CLID) seems to be naive but practical for GAN assessment. Notably, the experimental results seem to be convincing and illustrative. \n\nThe domain generalization idea from CNN-based discriminative feature extraction and gray level co-occurrence matrix-based high-frequency coding (superficial information), is an elegant strategy to favor domain generalization. Indeed, the linear projection learned from CNN, and GLCM features could be extended to different real-world applications regarding domain generalization and transferring learning. So, the paper is clear to follow and provides significant insights into a current topic.\n\nPros: \n- Clear mathematical foundations.\n- The approach can be applied to different up-to-date problems.\n-Though the obtained results are fair, the introduced approach would lead to significant breakthroughs regarding domain generalization techniques.\n\nCons:\n-Some experimental results can be difficult to reproduce. Indeed, authors claim that the training heuristic must be enhanced.\n-Table 2 results are not convincing.\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
