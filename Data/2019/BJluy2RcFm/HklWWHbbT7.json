{"title": "Emergency review for Janossy Pooling", "review": "I have found the ideas proposed in the paper very insightful and interesting. The paper, in general, is written very well and is accessible.  My most important concern is \n\n The whole development seems not as effective as k =1 in Table.2 (BTW, there is a typo there). One wonders, why for k =2, k =1 is not included? That is, can the formulation be changed in a way that \\downarrow operator represents l \\in {1 \\cdots k} projections?  In the end, the method creates k tuples and feed them through specific fs so why not having smaller tuples?\n\nThe rest of my review below hopefully can help improving the paper;\n\n\n- Is there any reason as to why higher order Janossy poolings do not perform as good as k =1 for the sum experiment? \n\n- Can you report the number of parameters for the developments (Janossy -k)? Some examples according to the experiments help.\n\n- I am a bit lost to grasp the paragraph below Eq.4, can you rephrase it and possibly provide references?\n\n- When it comes to testing, how do you use Eq.13? Do you sample a few permutation and compute 13? If yes, how many in practice? \n\n- In preposition 2.1,  n seems confusing, why not |h|\n\n- In P6, x_i is a sequence. this needs to be mentioned \n\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
