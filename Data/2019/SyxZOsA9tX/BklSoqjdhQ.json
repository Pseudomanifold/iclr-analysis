{"title": "Accelerated Value Iteration via Anderson Mixing", "review": "This paper seems like a nice idea, but I'm not sure if it's ready for publication. It seems that the main contribution of this paper is the DA2Q algorithm, since the A2VI algorithm is a straightforward application of AA to VI. However the numerical examples are very weak, only 3 games are tested, and the results are not that strong. Furthermore in Figure 3 with the results it's not clear what the 'Time' axis is.\n\nSmaller comments:\n\nIt seems like this recent paper should be cited:\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1808.03971\nit includes value iteration as an example, both in theory and in practice.\n\nI think that lemma 1 is a direct consequence of the fact that PI has finite convergence (this is easily seen since there are finite policies and it converges). \n\nIn the contraction for PI what is K?\n\nWith the constraints as specified after equation 5 it is no longer Anderson acceleration. The convex combination constraint is just the standard alpha >= 0 constraint.\n\nRejection step seems very onerous, how often does it occur in practice?\n\nNote that a simple application of AA to VI would not have the problem that it needs to \"Jump out of the subspace\".\n\nDA2Q algorithm as printed is very complicated, can it be simplified somehow? Just focusing on the novel steps would help.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
