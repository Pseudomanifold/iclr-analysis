{"title": "Paper is more suitable for conferences/journals in chemistry or bioengineering ", "review": "The paper proposes a Siamese network model for mapping the space of natural compounds to a latent representation space; furthermore, it utilizes this representation to compute a similarity score between an already known compound and a newly discovered one. \n\nSome comments:\n- Comparison with LDA requires more details: have you used the same number of topics for both small and large datasets?  How are you training it? \n- Page 4 the definition of micro-averaging is missing: \u201cMicro-averaging for precision and recall is formally defined as: \u201c \n- Figure 3 does not show a well defined clusters of various compound families because it\u2019s using same color for different families in some cases (according to the caption of Figure 3). I wonder if you can somehow show for which compound families the colors have been repeated or maybe show fewer compound families. \n\nThe problem of finding similar compounds to a novel compound from NMR spectra is an interesting applied problem; however, technical novelty of the paper is not significant. Given the level of technical novelty, I believe the paper is more suitable for a more applied conference/journal in the fields of chemistry or bioengineering.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
