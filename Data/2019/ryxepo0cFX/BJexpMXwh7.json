{"title": "capacity of long-term storage?", "review": "This is an interesting paper which proposes a novel angle on the problem of learning long-term dependencies in recurrent nets. The authors argue that most of the action should be in the imaginary part of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian J=F' of the new_state = old_state + epsilon F(old_state, input) incremental type of recurrence, while the real part should be slightly negative. If they were 0 the discrete time updates would still not be stable, so slightly negative (which leads to exponential loss of information) leads to stability while making it possible for the information decay to be pretty slow. They also propose a gated variant which sometimes works better. \n\nThis is similar to earlier work based on orthogonal or unitary Jacobians of new_state = H(old_state,input) updates, since the Jacobian of H(old_state,input) = old_state + epsilon F( old_state,input) is I + epsilon F'. In this light, it is not clear why the proposed architecture would be better than the partially orthogonal / unitary variants previously proposed. My general concern with this this type of architecture is that they can store information in 'cycles' (like in fig 1g, 1h) but this is a pretty strong constraint. For example, in the experiments, the authors did not apparently vary the length of the sequences (which would break the trick of using periodic attractors to store information). In practical applications this is very important. Also, all of the experiments are with classification tasks with few categories (10), i.e., requiring only storing 4 bits of information. Memorization tasks requiring to store many more bits, and with randomly varying sequence lengths, would better test the abilities of the proposed architecture.\n\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
