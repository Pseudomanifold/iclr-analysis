{"title": "not a careful consideration of causality, causal operation on graphical model, or conditional independence, etc....", "review": "\n\nThe objective of the paper is not clear. Which of these are the objective:\n\n- You want to build a classifier that is not influenced by the aging \nor \n- You want to *measure* the effect of disease by removing the age effect\n\n- On page 3, in the v structure A->X-<D, the mutual information between A and D is shown. In this structure, because A and D are independent of each other, the mutual information is zero. Do they mean conditional mutual information?\n\n- In this problem, D is a cause for X. Controlling for the effect (X) does not make sense here. P(D|do(X)) is simply P(D) because of the causal principle. Do(X) will cut the arrow from D to X but will not affect the distribution of D.\n\n- There is also a subtle difference between disease and diagnosis. The disease is the real status of the patient that we do not get to observe or expensive/unethical to measure while the diagnosis is kind of label given by a doctor. In this problem, it is not clear if D is decided based on A and X by the doctor or it is done differently. \n\n- The authors need to show the effectiveness of their method on simulated data.\n\n- For such a small sample size, I am not convinced the NN is necessary. In a small sample size regime, the proposed metric results in high variance estimation because there will be a very small number of subjects in each bucket. \n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
