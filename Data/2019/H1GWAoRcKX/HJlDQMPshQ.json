{"title": "Not convinced by the idea of using fewer frames to obtain the same representation for longer frames", "review": "Summary: The paper proposed an idea to distill from a full video classification model a small model that only receives smaller number of frames. \nQuality: \n- The paper needs to be carefully proofread. For example, \"classification less\" -> \"classification loss\".\n- I am not fully convinced by the proposed idea. If only a partial number of frames are observed, how could it achieve the same representation in theory? The proposed method can provide sub-optimal solution but the variance of the accuracy reduction might be huge.\n- The paper claims the teacher can be any video models and the paper uses a recurrent model as the teacher. However, there are models not recurrent, such as the I3D model which essentially models a small number of frames and then aggregate them together. So for those models, it is hard to see the value of the proposed method.\n\nClarity: \n- The idea is easy to catch but clarity of the technical part can be improved.\n- How is the small model used? Do you directly use partial videos to do classification or still need to aggregate the small models?\n\nOriginality: \n- I am not aware of existing works trying to distill a long-frame model to short-frame models.\n\nSignificance: \n- The contribution is incremental and the results are not significant. The uniform-k baseline already achieved a decent result while the proposed method added around 3% by increasing the system complication dramatically.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
