{"title": "Novelty", "review": "The introduction and the title does not match. Metric learning does not require to specify the dimension; while the embedding has to specify the reduced dimension. I feel confused that the authors mix these two concepts.\n\nThe objective in (1) is very close to that of t-SNE[5], where it uses the KL as the objective. Then other update formula are similar.  \n\nThis paper facilitates the effect of temperature in the Softmax function to heuristically learn a compact and spread-out embedding. However, such an idea have been widely used and investigated in Reinforcement learning [1], Knowledge distillation [2], classification [3] and discrete variable optimization [4] and t-SNE visualization [5] etc. Thus, the insight about the temperature effect on the embedding from the second last layer, cannot be novel any more. Based on this, the proposed ``heating-up\u201d strategy to leverage its effect on the embedding is heuristic, since the temperature parameter is manually set instead of automatically learning. In this case, I do expect the authors should provide more in-depth theoretical analysis. \n\nThe authors do not present more experimental results on the correlation between the final performance and this temperature setting. \n\nBesides, as the alpha increases or decreases, the side-effect on the learning rate setting for the optimization have not clearly analyzed, which leaves more concerns on tuning performance. \n\n\n[1] Sutton, R.
