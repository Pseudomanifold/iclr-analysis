{"title": "Novelty of the proposed method is very marginal", "review": "This paper proposed to use graph convolutional neural networks for link prediction. The authors proposed to use the dual graph to simultaneously learn node and edge embeddings. The label of the edges (positive or negative) are used as supervised signal for training the GCNs. Experiments on a few small data set prove the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.\n\nStrength:\n- important problem\n\nWeakness:\n- the novelty of the proposed method is very marginal\n- the experiments are quite weak\n\nDetails:\n- the novelty of the proposed method seems to be very marginal, which simply applies the GCN for link prediction. The existing GCN based method for recommendation shares similar ideas (e.g., Yin et al. 2018, PinSage), though dual hypergraph is not used. But the essential idea is very similar. \n- the data sets used in the experiments are too small\n- the node embedding based methods should be compared for link prediction, e.g., DeepWalk, LINE, and node2vec.\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
