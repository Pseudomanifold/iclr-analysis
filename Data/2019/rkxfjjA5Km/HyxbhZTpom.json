{"title": "Good results, but a slight gap between theory and practice.", "review": "In the paper , the authors proposed the use of autoencoder for Model-X knockoffs. The authors proved that, if there exists latent factors, and if the encoders and the decoders can approximate conditional distributions well, the autoencoder can be used for approximating Model-X knockoff random variables: one can find relevant features while controlling FDR (Theorem 2.2).\n\nI think the theoretical part is good, and the experimental results seem to be promising.\n\nMy concern is the gap between theory and practice. In the manuscript, the authors used VAE for approximating conditional distributions. The question is how we can confirm that the trained encoder and decoder satisfy the assumptions in Theorem 2.2. If the trained models violate the assumptions, the control of FDR is no longer guaranteed, which may lead to false discoveries. As long as this gap remains unfilled, we cannot use the procedure reliably: we always need to doubt whether the encoders and decoders are trained appropriately or not. I think this gap is unfavorable for scientific discovery where only rigid procedures are accepted.\nHow we can use the proposed procedure reliably, e.g. for scientific discovery? Is there any way to confirm that the encoders and decoders are appropriate? Or, is there any way to bypass the gap so that we can guarantee the FDR control even for inappropriate models?", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
