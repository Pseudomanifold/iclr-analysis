{"title": "spectral normalization for adversarial training", "review": "This paper proposes using spectral normalization (SN) as a regularization for adversarial training, which is based on [Miyato et. al., ICLR 2018], where the original paper used SN for GAN training. The paper also uses the results from [Neyshabur et. al., ICLR 2018], where the original paper provided generalization bounds that depends on spectral norm of each layer. \n\nThe paper is well written in general, the experiments are extensive. \n\nThe idea of studying based on the combination of the results from two previous papers is quite natural, since one uses spectral normalization in practice for GAN training, and the other provides generalization bound that depends on spectral norm. \n\nThe novelty of the algorithm itself is limited, since GAN and adversarial training are both minmax problems, and the original algorithm can be carried over easily. The experimental result itself is quite comprehensive. \n\nOn the other hand, this paper provides specific generalization bounds under three adversarial attack methods, which explains the power of SN under those settings. However, it is not clear to me that these are some novel results that can better help adversarial training.\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
