{"title": "Interesting but not novel", "review": "This paper proposes a hierarchical RNN, where the first layer is note-level and the second level is measure-level. In an experiment on the Nottingham MIDI dataset, they show slight improvements in log-likelihood.\n\nOverall:\n\nThis is an interesting application of hierarchical RNNs. However, hierarchical RNNs are known to improve performance. This is an application of existing work (for example, Alexander Graves' thesis also uses hierarchical RNNs and shows improved performance). For an applications-oriented paper, I would hope to see many more experiments than just one on a tiny dataset, and improvements in log-likelihood that are more than the marginal improvements reported here. The human evaluation is neat but is inconclusive\u2013in a glaring act of omission, the authors do not link to samples generated by their model, while they include samples generated by the competition. For a fair review, one would hope to compare the models side by side to qualitatively judge the reliability of the MTurk experiments.\n\nMinor nits:\n\nI appreciate the human evaluation experiments on MTurk but they are very difficult to understand with the figure 5. Please label the y-axis. Think of a different way to present the results. Do not include the numbers on the bars. \n\nThe acronym HierArchical PolyPhonic musIc gEnerative RNN is destructive; it devalues useful acronyms. Please do not use it.\n\nThe paper has many grammatical and spelling errors. Please hyphenate compound adjectives. \n", "rating": "2: Strong rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
