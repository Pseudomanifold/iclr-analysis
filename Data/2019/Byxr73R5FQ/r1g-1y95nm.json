{"title": "A sound technique, but incremental comparing to previous methods learning eigenoption and learning bottleneck states based on SRs.", "review": "This paper studies of the problem of HRL. It proposed an option discovery algorithm based on successor representations (SR). It considers both tabular and function approximation settings. The main idea is to first learn SR representation, and then based on the leant SR representation to clusters states using kmeans++ to identify subgoals. It iterate between this two steps to incrementally learn the SR options. The technique is sound, but incremental comparing to previous methods learning eigenoption and learning bottleneck states based on SRs. \n\nHere are the comments for this manuscript:\n \nHow sensitive is the performance to the number of subgoals? How is the number of option determined?\n\nIt is unclear to me why the termination set of every option is the set of all states satisfying Q(s, a)\\leq 0. Such a definition seems very adhoc.\n\nRegarding the comparison to eigenoptions, arethey learned from SR as well? It seems that the cited paper for eigenoptions is based on the graph laplacian. If that is true, a more recent paper learns eigenoptions based on SR should be discussed and included for the comparison.\n\nMachado et al., Eigenoption Discovery through the Deep Successor Representation, ICLR2018\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
