{"title": "Interesting idea but with insufficient experimental validation", "review": "The paper proposes a compositional generative model for GANs. Basically, assuming existence of K objects in the image, the paper creates a latent representation for each object as well as a latent representation for the background. To model the relation between objects, the paper utilizes the multi-head dot-product attention (MHDPA) due to Vaswani et a. 2017. Applying MHDPA to the K latent representations results in K new latent representations. The K new representations are then fed into a generator to synthesize an image containing one object. The K images together with the synthesized background image are then combined together to form the final image. The paper compares to the proposed approach to the standard GAN approach. The reported superior performance suggest the inductive bias of compositionality of scene leads to improved performance.\n\nThe method presented in the paper is a sensible approach and is overall interesting. The experiment results clearly shows the advantage of the proposed method. However, the paper does have several weak points. Firs of all, it misses an investigation of alternative network design for achieving the same compositionality. For example, what would be the performance difference if one replace the MHDPA with LSTM. Another weak point is that it is unclear if the proposed method can be generalize to handle more complicated scene such as COCO images as the experiments are all conducted using very toy-like image datasets.
