{"title": "Could benefit from a revision including more comprehensive experiments.", "review": "This paper tackles the problem of noisy measurements collected from same samples that may result in different experimental data collection scenarios, especially in biology. Given S different data batches of the same samples, this paper aims to perform manifold alignment between each batch using feature correspondences.\nThe motivation is that even though data points from each experiments may differ due to noise coming from different factors, they should at least exhibit some correlations in the feature space. Such correlation is exploited by embedding each batch of data in a space represented by diffusion coordinates computed using an anisotropic kernel. Inter-batch correlations are computed between diffusion coordinates of each batch, which are exploited to construct an isometric transformation between each pair of diffusion coordinates of batch datasets. The later transformation is used to construct an aligned graph Laplacian where each batch have similar representations. \n\nThis paper tackles an important problem using a novel approach where instead of aligning each pair of data-points it is attempting to align geometries of batch specific manifolds. The authors show through a toy experiment on MNIST that the proposed algorithm indeed is able to align manifolds accurately. Moreover it is also able to perform manifold denoising and achieves superior classification results compared to two existing approaches. Finally, the proposed algorithm is applied to a practical biological case and shows that it is indeed able to align data from two different immune profiles.\n\nAlthough the paper tackles efficiently an important problem, I am concerned about the experimental section and think it would be improved by taking the following points into account: \n\n\u2022\tThe proposed approach is compared only with two other algorithms. For example, one could compare the denoising ability to [Hein and Maier 2006: manifold denoising] or [Cui et al: Generalized unsupervised Manifold Alignment] for manifold alignment. Furthermore, it would be informative to see how the proposed approach compares to recent domain adaptation approaches as they attempt to map data from different domains into a shared \nrepresentation which is rather similar to what the proposed algorithm is doing.\n\u2022\tExperiments are all performed using rather simple datasets. It would be interesting to see how the algorithms would perform on slightly more complicated images such as Cifar 10 for example. \n\u2022\tIt is not clear what are the next steps to perform after obtaining Eq. 2\n\u2022\tIt is not clear what are the number of filters in Figure 2 a).\n\u2022\tFigure 1 needs to be clarified further: What are DM1, DM2, DM3 mean?
