{"title": "Low latency version of CryptoNet", "review": "This paper proposes a low latency data representation / network architecture to operate on encrypted data. This work is based on CryptoNet, but uses a different data representation. How to apply machine learning on confidential data is important in many practical applications.\n\nI recommend to give a brief review of HE before Section 3, to be more friendly.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}
