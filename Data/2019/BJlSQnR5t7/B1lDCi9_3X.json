{"title": "I'll need better argument for the significance of this paper", "review": "In this work, the author(s) proposed to replace the random feature approximation with Nystrom approximation for kernelized deep neural networks.\n\nThe contribution of this work seems pretty incremental to me.  It's well known that Nystrom usually provides a more succinct/concise approximation of the Gram matrix. And its performance also critically depends on the choice of inducing points, which reminds me there is a lack of discussion on this matter in the paper. Often times, Cholesky  factorization works even better compared with Nystrom according to my own experience. \n\nKernelizing deep networks is a  challenging task on its own, and the reality is that it often does nothing more than slowing down the computation without tangible improvements. It takes much more than ``Nystromizing'' to convince me.
