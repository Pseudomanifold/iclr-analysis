{"title": "original", "review": "In this paper, authors propose a \"universal\" Gaussian balck-box adversarial attack.\nOriginal and well-written (although there are a few grammar mistakes that would require some revision) and structured. Having followed the comments and discussion I am convinced that the proposed method is state of the art and interesting enough fro ICLR.\nTo the best of my knowledge, the study is technically sound.\nIt fairly accounts for recent literature in the field.\nExperiments are convincing.\nOne thing I am not so convinced about is the naming of the evaluation curve as \"a new ROC curve\". I understand the appeal of pairing the proposed evaluation curve with the ROC curve but, beyond an arguable resemblance, they have no much in common, really.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
