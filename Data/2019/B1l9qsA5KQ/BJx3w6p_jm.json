{"title": "Bdrank for fatigue monitoring of EEG driving simulator experiments", "review": "The paper studies fatigue monitoring of EEG driving simulator experiments using various EEG analysis algorithms, one also based on ranking. The data used was from a prior experiment. \n\nThe paper is written in a rather confusing manner, which makes the assessment of originality and significance a hard task for the reviewer. A novel algorithm Bdrank (based on raking is defined) and compared to 2 other algorithms; unclear why with these and not with others. The paper ignores a large portion of the literature, starting with Kohlmorgen et al 2007, Blankertz group, Lee group etc. \nThe results  are only somewhat interesting, no understanding of the underlying physiological processes is given. \n\nOverall, I consider the paper somewhat preliminary. ", "rating": "2: Strong rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
