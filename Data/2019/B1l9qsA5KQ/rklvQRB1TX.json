{"title": "Review of mental fatigue monitoring using brain dynamics preferences", "review": "The mental fatigue is an important factor in road accidents. Finding a direct mapping between EEG features and reaction time is difficult and error-prone, combining the noise measurement of EEG and individual variation of RT.  The authors introduce a measure called BDrank based on partial ordering instead of regression. Formulating the measure as a MAP problem, the authors propose a generalized EM algorithm for prediction. An online extension, relying on iterative L-BFGS optimization over mini-batches. \n\nFigure 3 shows the indegree sequence for 4 selected subjects. What is the criterion to select these subjects? These cases seem interesting, but is it representative for the best/worst case? It could provide some information to show some of the few cases where SVR is more accurate than BDrank.\nRegarding the identification of noisy channels, the 33rd channel is indicated as a non-EEG one. What is it?\n\nSome minor questions and suggestions:\n- It could be interesting to mention the performance of this measure using only a limited set of EEG channels to evaluate its robustness.\n- The introduction indicates that de Naurois et al ., 2017 rely on EEG to estimate the RT, but it is not the case.\n- The formulation of the assumption (2) on page 3 is unclear, as sensors are not supposed to make any emission and there is a high correlation between channels.\n- The model do not consider transition between type-1 and -2 preference, could it be a problem with confidence interval", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
