{"title": "Good beginning. Algorithm is not that interesting  ", "review": "This paper is quite interesting as it tries to find a new metric for evaluating GANs. IS is a terrible metric, as memorization would achieve high score and test log-likelihood cannot be evaluated. I like the long discussion at the beginning of the paper about what a metric for evaluating implicit generative models would need to be a valid and useful metric. This problem is of great importance for GANs as proving that GANs solve the density estimation problem would be extremely hard and even more so, making sure we are close to a good solution with any finite sample even more so (I am talking to non-trivial examples in high dimensions). It is clear that in order to make GANs, in particular, or implicit models, in general, useful, we need to find metrics that would allow us to achieve progress. This paper is a direction in what it needed. In this sense I think the paper can be a good starting point for the discussion that we are not having right now, because we are too focused on making sure they converge, but not how they can be useful. \n\nOn the down side, I think the proposed DNN metric is not exactly useful. It would be a subset of the metric that an MMD would give and it would focus only in some properties of the images but not on the whole distribution. So, if this metric does not capture the relevant aspects of the problem the GAN is trying to imitate, it will fail to provide that metric that we are looking for. \n\nI would see this paper as a great workshop paper, in the sense of old-fashion NIPS workshops in which new ideas were tested and discussed. But it clearly would like the polished papers that we see in conferences these days. Bernhard Schoelkopf told me once, after receiving the ICML reviews, \u201cPeople now focus more on reasons to reject a paper than in reason for accepting a paper.\u201d (note that I am quoting from memory, the bad use of English in mine not his). There are many reasons to reject this paper, but also some reason to accept the paper.  \n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
