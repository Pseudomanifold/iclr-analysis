{"title": "application of multimodal VAE for zero shot learning", "review": "This paper proposes a multimodal VAE model for the problem of generalized zero shot learning (GZSL). In GZSL, the test classes can contain examples from both seen as well as unseen classes, and due to the bias of the model towards the seen classes, the standard GZSL approaches tend to predict the majority of the inputs to belong to seen classes. The paper proposes a multimodal VAE model to mitigate this issue where a shared manifold learning learn for the inputs and the class attribute vectors.\n\nThe problem of GZSL is indeed important. However, the idea of using multimodal VAE for ZSL isn't new or surprising and has been used in earlier papers too. In fact, multimodal VAEs are natural to apply for such problems. The proposed multimodal VAE model is very similar to the existing ones, such as Vedantam et al (2017), who proposed a broad framework with various types of regularizers in the multimodal VAE framework. Therefore, the methodological novelty of the work is somewhat limited.\n\nThe other key issue is that the experimental results are quite underwhelming. The paper doesn't compare with several recent ZSL and GZSL approaches, some of which have reported accuracies that look much better than the accuracies achieved by the proposed method. The paper does cite some of these papers (such as those based on synthesized examples) but doesn't provide any comparison. Given that the technical novelty is somewhat limited, the paper falls short significantly on the experimental analysis.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
