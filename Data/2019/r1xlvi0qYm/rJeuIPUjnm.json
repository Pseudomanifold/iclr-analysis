{"title": "High quality piece of research", "review": "This paper investigates the average contribution of a sequence input to the contents of memory and derives a simple scheme to maximize the information content in memory, which is essentially to write at uniformly spaced intervals. Furthermore they present an attention-based version, where the network caches all hidden states in an interval and selects the hidden state to store via attention. \n\nThe paper is very well written and has a nice balance of relevant theoretic motivation and experiments. Furthermore the question that the authors are tackling --- how should we compress information into external memories --- feels important and under-explored. The fact that the resulting scheme is simple is nice, because it's easy for people to try, and it now has some motivation beyond a heuristic decision.\n\nI think this paper will have impact in opening up more comprehensive research into the reduction of redundancy in the external memories of neural networks, and also could be instantly impactful for people using DNCs and NTMs --- especially since we see the incorporation of UW / CUW can help bridge the gap (or even surpass) LSTMs for the modeling of natural data. As such I think it is a clear accept. \n\n---\n\nComments to the authors:\n\nThe results in Figure 2 (c) I think are misleading. The NTM with an RNN controller can solve this task, the limit of 10,000 steps implies that the model may converge to some 50% value with 14 slots but I am absolutely certain that the NTM + RNN controller would converge in 10,000 steps with a careful tuning of gradient clipping and learning rate. I think this is basically a false result. Furthermore I would like to really know what the best final performance of the models are on this task once converged, it's not clear if 10,000 steps was enough.\n\nFor equation (9), was it necessary to construct the attention weights in this way? How much better was it to a direct softmax query: softmax(h_{t-1}^T d_j)? If you are backpropagating through the attention then the network can shape the hidden states to facilitate the relevant attention, as well as contain the information.\n\nIn the second paragraph of S2.2.2 you have \"a_{t, j} is the attention score\" but you should have \"\\alpha_{t, j} is the attention score\".\n\nTable 3: just include the Transformer results in the table!? The reasoning to exclude it is not really coherent.\n\nIt would have been nice (and would raise my score) to see the UW scheme operating with a large(ish) number of memory slots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "rating": "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
