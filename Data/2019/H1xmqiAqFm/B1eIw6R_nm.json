{"title": "A good start, but lack of sufficient support", "review": "This paper attempted to analyse the performance of CNN models when data is mislabelled in different manners, i.e. class dependent labels and class independent labels. It carried out several good experiments as a good start, but several points are not comprehensively studied and analysed. \n1. Try to provide more direct and solid proofs on the relationship between conceptual and visual distances between class dependent labels. \n2. In table 1, model trained with noise on class dependent label has lower fooling rate than model trained with clean data. Is it worth exploiting in a deeper manner?\n3. In figure 5, why the curve appears so different after block 4 only? Would visualising feature maps from different layers help understand this observation?\n4. In figure 6, it seems that the difference between those experiments is marginal, which contribute little to the argument of this paper.\n5. About the discussion on 'cluster', it would be better if sufficient experiments and analysis can be provided.\n\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
