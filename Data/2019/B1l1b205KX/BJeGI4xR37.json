{"title": "Interesting work", "review": "This paper proposes an unsupervised method to disentangle the latent code of VAE. Overall, it is novel and well written. The experiment has shown good performance of the proposed method.\n \nI have some concerns as follows:\n1.  In Eq.(1), y is assumed to follow a Gaussian distribution. Is it possible that y follows a multinomial distribution? Then, this model can be used for clustering.\n\n2. In section 2.3, the concatenation between z and y is used to learn a complementary of y.  Why does the concatenation encourage  to learn the complementary of y? More explanations are needed.  Additionally, some experiments are needed to verify this claim.\n\n\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
