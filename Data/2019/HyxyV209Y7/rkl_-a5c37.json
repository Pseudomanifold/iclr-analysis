{"title": "This paper studies poisoning attack to node embedding methods. The studied problem needs to be further clarified. ", "review": "This paper studies poisoning attack to node embedding methods. It is assumed that the attacker can manipulate the poisoned graph G by adding or deleting edges. \nThe proposed method is evaluated on two adversarial goals:\n1)\tIn the integrity attack, the target is to change the probability of the edge connected with a pair of nodes. Why bothered to change the probability of the existence of edges?  Since in the assumption, attackers are powerful enough to directly add or delete any edges.\n2)\tIn availability attack, the goal is to reduce the performance over a test set. What is the \u201cperformance\u201d here? What is measured by average precision score?\n\nThe experimental evaluation doesn\u2019t show a strong support to the purpose of study. The baselines are \u201crandom selection\u201d and \u201cPageRank\u201d.   Why not comparing to an attack strategy based on the \u201cnode degree\u201d for adding or deleting edges?", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
