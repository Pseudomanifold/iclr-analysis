{"title": "Applying some existing attack models to node embedding with limited novelty; paper presentation is also an issue", "review": "This paper aims to propose effective data poisoning attack against node embedding methods. As explained in the paper, node embedding methods like DeepWalk and LINE can be cast under a matrix factorisation framework as explained in [Qiu 2017] and restated in the paper. Also, data poisoning attacks on matrix factorisation have been studied in [Li 2016]. It then becomes straightforward to do data poisoning attacks on node embedding methods. And in fact the two types of attacks being analysed are the same as those mentioned in [Li 2016]. Projected gradient descent is used in both [Li 2016] and this paper. So, it seems to me that the key contribution of this paper is more like applying the attacks proposed in [Li 2016] to node embedding problem without much novelty.\n\n+ve: \n1. The problem is an interesting and trendy one.\n\n-ve:\n1. The originality of this work is limited as presented above.\n2. The quality of the paper presentation is not satisfactory. \n\nSpecific comments: \n- Section 5.1 is hard to follow while Section 5.2 is too short to gain more insight\n- There are quite many typo mistakes and the paper is not well organised and presented.\nSection 2 line 5:    ... graph neural networks (),\nSection 2 last para, third last line:    ... unsupervised methods for gra*g*h\nSection 5.1 line 3: ... the adjacency matrix is continous  -> continuous\n...
