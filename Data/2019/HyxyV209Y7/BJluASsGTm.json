{"title": "Addressed an interesting and important topic; but the significance of the work can be improved.", "review": "To really understand how robust the node embedding methods are to poisoning attacks, the authors should conduct experiments on various random graph models. Examples of random graph models include Erdos-Renyi, Stochastic Kronecker Graph, Configuration Model with power-law degree distribution, Barabasi-Albert, Watts-Strogatz, Hyperbolic Graphs, Block Two-level Erdos-Renyi, etc. That way we can learn what types of networks are more susceptible to attacks on node embeddings and perhaps look into why some are more vulnerable than others.  For instance, an Erdos-Renyi graph should be very robust to attacks because the connections are random.
