{"title": "Original Idea, Incomplete set of experiments", "review": "Authors propose a novel combination of RBM feature extractor and CNN classifiers to gain robustness toward adversarial attacks. They first train a small mean field boltzmann machine on 4x4 patches of MNIST, then combine 4 of these into a larger 8x8 feature extractor. Authors use the RBM 8x8 feature representation as a fixed convolutional layer and train a CNN on top of it. The intuition behind the idea is that since RBMs are generative, the RBM layer will act as a denoiser. \n\nOne question which is not addressed is the reason for only one RBM layer. In \"Stacks of convolutional Restricted Boltzmann Machines for shift-invariant feature learning\" by Norouzi et al, several RBM layers are trained greedily (same as here, only difference is contrastive loss vs mean field) and they achieve 0.67% error on MNIST. Attacking CRBMs is highly relevant and should be included as a baseline.\n\nThe only set of experiments are comparisons on first 500 MNIST test images. If the test set is not shuffled (by emphasis on first I assume not) these images are from training NIST (cleaner) set and may not include samples of all digits. Authors should clarify the justification behind experimenting only on 'first 500 test images'. \n\nFurthermore, as authors discussed the iterative weight sharing which increases the depth can vanish the gradient toward input. Including at least one set of black box attacks is necessary to verify to what degree the vanishing gradient is the case here. The iterative architecture is similar to the routing in CapsNet (Hinton 2018) in terms of weight sharing between successive layers. Although their network was resilient toward white box attacks they suffered from black box attacks. The boundary method on MNIST could be  weaker than a black box attack.
