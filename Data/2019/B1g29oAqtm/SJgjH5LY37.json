{"title": "weak contribution", "review": "This paper study the model-based approach in deterministic low dimensional continuous control. As far as I am concerned and I understood, the main contribution of this paper is in substituting one-step-ahead prediction model with a multiple-step prediction model, resulting in a more accurate prediction model. I was not able to find points beyond this. I would be happy if the authors could clarify it.
