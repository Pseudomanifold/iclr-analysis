{"title": "Interesting direction for probabilistic inference with CNNs and good semi-supervised learning results, but writing is difficult to follow", "review": "Summary: This paper introduces the Neural Rendering Model (NRM), a generative model in which the computations involved in inference correspond to those of a CNN forward pass. The NRM\u2019s supervised learning objective is lower bounded by a variant of the cross-entropy objective. This objective is used to formulate a max-min network, which has a particular type of weight sharing between a standard branch with max pooling / ReLUs and a second branch with min pooling / NReLUs. The max-min objective and network show strong performance on semi-supervised learning tasks. \n\nPosing a CNN as inference in a generative model is an interesting direction, and could be very useful for probabilistic inference in the context of neural nets. However, the paper is rather difficult to follow and requires frequent reference to the appendix to understand the main body. Some important components (like those relating to rendering paths and RPNs) are given good intuitive explanations early on but remain a bit ambiguous throughout the paper. I would recommend improving the presentation before publication.\n\nQuestion: \u201cwe can modify NRM to incorporate our knowledge of the tasks and datasets into the model and perform JMAP inference to achieve a new CNN architecture.\u201c\nI appreciate the CNN / NRM correspondence in Table 1, and see how the NRM may be modified to produce modified CNN architectures. That being said, I am not sure I understand what sorts of task-specific knowledge are being referred to here. Could you give an example of a type of knowledge that the NRM would allow you to bake into a CNN architecture, but would otherwise be difficult to incorporate?\n\nMinor:\n\u201cAs been shown later in Section 2.2\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026is part of the optimization in equation equation 6.\u201d", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
