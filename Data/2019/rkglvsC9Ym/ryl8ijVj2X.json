{"title": "Missing theoretical analysis of Log-Cosh Loss  ", "review": "This paper proposes to change the L2 norm of loss function of VAE into hyperbolic cosh function. The idea  and presentation are clear and straightforward. However, the used cosh function does not convince me since when t=a, f(t,a) will still be very large! Also, they will grow fast with exp|at|. The authors are encouraged to provide more detailed proofs for the advantages of cosh function.\n\nApart from the cosh loss, the Huber loss is well-known robust loss function used in statistics and many computer vision applications, and it has the similar properties of cosh function. I feel surprised that the authors do not aware this and do not compare it in experiments. \n\nThe introduction is a bit confusing. GAN is an implicit generative model as it does not have any explicit density form, but the likelihood and prior of vanilla VAE are Gaussian. I am not clear what is the motivation to introduce the cosh loss function.\n\nIf the authors aim to improve the generative quality, there are several works, such as using PixelCNN or other advanced likelihoods, improve the VAE. Besides these, recently MAE uses mutual information as the regularization to improve the quality. \n\nOverall, this work does not convey any theoretical analysis and significant results over state-of-the-art.\n\n\n\n \n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
