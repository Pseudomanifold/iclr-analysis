{"title": "Limited novelty with scope limited to single sentence generation", "review": "This paper proposes using a deliberation network approach to text generation with GANs. It does this by using two decoders where the discriminator is trained on the second decoder and signals from that training are also used to improve the first decoder.\n\nSince both approaches have been published before (deliberation networks and policy-gradient based GAN training), the novelty seems to be limited. Additionally, the experiments appear to mostly be focused on single sentence text generation, which is usually not an issue for maximum likelihood trained models. The poor samples from DelibMLE appear much worse than typical maximum likelihood trained language models. Since the model sizes and hyperparameters are not given, it's possible this is due to an overly small model. The lack of a detailed description of the model hyperparameters would also make this work very hard to reproduce.\n\nThere's also very little description of the datasets, for example, the length of a typical example. Finally, while the human evaluation results are interesting, the lack of standard deviations make it hard to measure the significance of the results, especially when only 100 sentences from each model is rated.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
