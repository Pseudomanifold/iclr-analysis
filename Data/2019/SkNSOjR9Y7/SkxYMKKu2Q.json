{"title": "It is a simple and trivial  extension of VAE with important sampling", "review": "This paper propose to use important sampling to optimize VAE with discrete latent variables. Basically, the methods proposed by this paper is rather simple and trivial. There are some discussions on why important sampling is not a good choice for VAE. Please refer: https://stats.stackexchange.com/q/255756\n\nMoreover, if you focus on VAE with discrete latent variable, you should compare at least with Gumbel-Softmax: https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01144\n", "rating": "1: Trivial or wrong", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
