{"title": "Good paper of using meta-learning to solve the bilevel optimization problem in graph attacking", "review": "This paper proposes an algorithm to alter the structure of a graph by adding/deleting edges so as to degrade the global performance of node classification. The main idea is to use the idea of meta-gradients from meta-learning to solve the bilevel optimization problem. \n\nThe paper is clearly presented. The main contribution is to use meta-learning to solve the bilevel optimization in the discrete graph data using greedy selection approach. From the experimental results, this treatment is really effective in attacking the graph learning models (GCN, CLN, DeepWalk). However, the motivation in using meta-learning to solve the bilevel optimization is not very clear to me, e.g., what are the advantages it can offer?\n\nTheoretically, the paper could have given some discussion on the optimality of the meta-gradient approach to bilevel optimization to strengthen the theoretical aspect. For the greedy selection approach in Eq (8), is there any sub-modularity for the score function used?\n\nSome minor suggestions and comments:\n1) please summarize the attacking procedures in the form of an algorithm\n2) please have some discussion on attacking the graph attributes besides the structure\n3) please have an complexity analysis and empirical evaluations of the meta-gradient computations and approximations", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
