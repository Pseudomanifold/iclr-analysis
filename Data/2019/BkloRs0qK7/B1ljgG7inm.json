{"title": "An empirical study of CF, but more recent methods could have been also added for the study", "review": "Thanks for the updates and rebuttals from the authors. \n\nI now think including the results for HAT may not be essential for the current version of the paper. I now understand better about the main point of the paper - providing a different setting for evaluating algorithms for combatting CF, and it seems the widespread framework may not accurately reflect all aspects of the CF problems. \n\nI think showing the results for only 2 tasks are fine for other settings except for DP10-10 setting, since most of them already show CF in the given framework for 2 tasks. Maybe only for DP10-10, the authors can run multiple tasks setting, to confirm their claims about the permuted datasets. (but, I believe the vanilla FC model should show CF for multiple permuted tasks.)\n\nI have increased my rating to \"6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\" - it could have been much better to at least give some hints to overcome the CF for the proposed setting, but I guess giving extensive experimental comparisons could be valuable for a publication. \n\n=====================\nSummary:\n\nThe paper evaluates several recent methods regarding catastrophic forgetting with some stricter application scenarios taken into account. They argue that most methods, including EWC and IMM, are prone to CF, which is against the argument of the original paper. \n\nPro:\n- Extensive study on several datasets, scenarios give some intuition and feeling about the CF phenomenon. \n\nCon:\n- There are some more recent baselines., e.g., Joan Serr\u00e0, D\u00eddac Sur\u00eds, Marius Miron, Alexandros Karatzoglou, \"Overcoming catastrophic forgetting with hard attention to the task\" ICML2018, and it would be interesting to see the performance of those as well. \n- The authors say that the permutation based data set may not be useful. But, their experiments are only on two tasks, while many work in literature involves much larger number of tasks, sometimes up to 50. So, I am not sure whether the paper's conclusion that the permutation-based SLT should not be used since it's only based on small number of tasks. \n- While the empirical findings seem useful, it would have been nicer to propose some new method that can get around the issues presented in the paper.
