{"title": "Interesting topic of limited novelty", "review": "The paper presents a study of the application of some well known methods on 9 datasets focusing on the issue of catastrophic forgetting when considering a sequential learning task in them.  In general the presentation of concepts and results is a bit problematic and unclear. Comments, such that the paper presents ' a novel training and model selection paradigm for incremental learning in DNNs ' is not justified.  A better description of the results, e.g., in Table 3 should be presented, as well a better linking with the findings; a better structure of the latter would also be required to improve consistency of them. Improving these could make the paper candidate for a poster presentation.
