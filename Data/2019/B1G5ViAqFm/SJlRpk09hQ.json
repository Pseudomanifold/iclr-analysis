{"title": "Hard to Understand, insufficient results.", "review": "This paper introduces a method for handing input data that is defined on irregular mesh-type domains. If I understand it correctly, the core technique is  to perform Fourier analysis to transform the input data to the frequency domain, which is then transformed back to a regular domain before applying a standard neural network. The claimed result is that this is better than standard linear interpolations. The key technical contribution is to define FT on points, edges, and meshes (This reviewer appreciates these efforts). Explicit formula are given. However, the paper does not perform convolutions on the input irregular domain directly, which is quite disappointing. The experimental results are preliminary. It is expected to perform evaluation on more applications such as semantic segmentation. \n\n\nThe major issue of the paper is that the goal was not stated clearly. Does it target for a neural network that is defined on irregular domains or simply a technique to handling irregular domains? Given the Fourier transform, it is possible to define convolutions directly as multiplications in the Fourier domain....the paper can be more interesting, if it follows this line.\n\nOverall, it is hard to champion the paper based on the current technical approach and the experimental results. \n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
