{"title": "positive solution to learn across varied graph topologies", "review": "Convolutiuonnal Neural Networks on Non-uniform Geometrical Signals using Euclidean Spectral Transformation\n\nThe paper tackles the challenging problem of learning across mixed graph topologies, which is today a real challenge. It is highly original due to the unified general framework for handling differing graph topologies. The method is highly generalizable to other learning techniques since it proposes a transformation of varied topologies into a cartesian grid-like embedding, via the new non-uniform Fourier transform. The method is evaluated on MNIST, Shape Retrieval, and point to surface reconstruction. The paper is dense and uses non-trivial mathematical formulations, but reads well and remains easy to follow. The experiments supports well, and greatly adds clarity to understand the proposed methodology. Overall, recommendation towards acceptance. \n\nPositive\n+ Develop a method to analyze signal on mixed topologies with a new non-uniform Fourier transform.\n+ The proposed approach has advantages on -reducing sampling error, -unified framework for mixed topology, -reducing heuristics in designing can architecture, -local weights in mesh structures.\n+ Improved performance in surface reconstruction task.\n\nSpecific Comments\n- In the inverse Fourier Transformation, a voxel-like grid structure is used, however - how to control the size of this volume? If the size is large, or explodes, the complexity of the cnn architecture would explode as well - How is this size issue tackled?\n- In this same inverse Fourier Transformation, the whole infinite space would be obviously hard to sample - Spectral information would be lost - How bad is this and how does this impact results?  How would this compare to direct graph-based methods, for instance, in a fixed graph structure?\n- Ovsjanikov\u2019s Functional maps, siggraph 2012, have been proposed to find maps between differing graph spectrum, partly solving the problem of handling graphs of multiple topologies. One way would be to find spectral correspondences between embeddings. How helpful would this be to find similarities between embeddings in this new proposed unified framework?\n\nTypos - geometris", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
