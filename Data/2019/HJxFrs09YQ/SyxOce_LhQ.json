{"title": "acceptable", "review": "The authors proposed a generalized adaptive moment estimation method(Game). Compared to the existing methods AMSGrad and PAdam, the new method Game tracks only two parameters in iteration and hence saves memory. Besides, they introduced a additional tuning parameter $q$ to track the q-th moment of the gradient and allow more flexibility. The authors also provided the theoretical convergence analysis of Game for convex optimization and smooth nonconvex optimization. Their experiment shows Game may produce better performance than AMSGrad and PAdam with a little bit sacrifice of convergence speed. Game is a promising alternative method for training large-scale neural network.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
