{"title": "Nice, clean generative model, wonder how it would perform on a more challenging dataset.", "review": "The paper proposes a genarative model for images which explicitly separates the within class variation \n(the covariant part) from the across class variation (invariant part). Functionally, this achieves a similar \nresult as various recent works on incorporating invariances in neural nets, but the fact that it is able \nto explicitly construct models for both parts of the distribution is nice. Results on MNIST are good, \nbut of course this is a very simple dataset. It would be very interesting to see how the model \nperforms on a more realistic problem. \n\nAdmittedly, I am not an expert in generative models. This is a clean paper with a clear goal, it is hard \nfor me to judge how original the idea is.\n\n\"Covariant\" might not be the best word to use here because it has a very specific meaning in the context \nof some other neural networks related to how quantities transform according to representations of a symmetry \ngroup. This is a potential source of confusion.
