{"title": "Promising results, but use of dependency parser is somewhat concerning", "review": "This paper proposes a seq2seq model which incorporates dependency parse information from the source side by embedding each word's subgraph (according to a predetermined dependency parse) using the Graph2Seq model of Song et al. (2018); the authors propose two variants for achieving an encoded source-side representation from the subgraph embeddings, involving bidirectional lstms. The authors show that the proposed approach leads to good results on three translation datasets.\n\nThe paper is generally written fairly clearly, though I think the clarity of section 3.3 could be improved; it took me several reads to understand the architectural difference between this second variant and the original one. The results presented are also impressive: I don't think the IWSLT de-en results are in fact state of the art (e.g., Edunov et al. (NAACL 2018) and Deng et al. (NIPS 2018) outperform these numbers, though both papers use BPE, whereas I assume the current paper does not), but the results on the other two datasets appear to be.\n\nRegarding the approach in general, it would be nice to see how much it depends on the quality of the dependency parse. In particular, while we might expect the en-de and en-vi results to be good because dependency parsers for English are relatively good, how much does performance degrade when considering languages with less good dependency parsers?\n\nPros:\n- Good results, fairly simple model\n\nCons:\n- Somewhat incremental, not clear how much method depends on quality of the dependency parser", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
