The authors of this paper continue this development in a very interesting and natural way by showing how SMC can be used to solve challenging planning problems. This is a enabled by reformulating the planning problem as an inference problem via the recent trend referred to as \"control as inference\". While there is unfortunately no real world experiments, the simulations clearly illustrate the potential of the approach.\nWhile the idea of viewing control as inference is far from new the idea of using SMC in this context is clearly novel as far as I can see. Well, there has been some work along the same general topic before, see e.g.\nAndrieu, C., Doucet, A., Singh, S.S., and Tadic, V.B. (2004). Particle methods for change detection, system identification, and contol. Proceedings of the IEEE, 92(3), 423\u2013438.\nHowever, the particular construction proposed in this paper is refreshingly novel and interesting. Hence, I view the specific idea put fourth in this paper as highly novel. The general idea of viewing control as inference goes far back and there are very nice dual relationships between LQG and the Kalman filter established and exploited long time ago.\n\nThe authors interprets \"control as inference\" as viewing the planning problem as a simulation exercise where we aim to approximate the distribution of optimal future trajectories. A bit more specifically, the SMC-based planning proposed in the paper stochastically explores the most promising trajectories in the tree and randomly removes (via the resampling operation) the less promising branches. Importantly there are convergence guarantees via the use of SMC. The idea is significant in that it opens up for the use of the by now strong SMC body of methods and analysis when it comes to challenging and intractable planning problems. I foresee many interesting developments to follow in the direction layed out by this paper. \n\nWhen it comes to your SMC algorithm you will suffer from path degeneracy (as all SMC algorithms does, see e.g. Figure 1 in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1307.3180.pdf) and if h is large I think this can be a problem for you. However, this can easily be fixed via backward simulation. For an overview of backward simulation see \nLindsten, F. and Schon, T. \"Backward simulation methods for Monte Carlo statistical inference\". Foundations and Trends in Machine Learning, 6(1):1-143, 2013.\n\nI am positive to this paper (clearly reveled by my score as well), but there are of course a few issues as well:\n1. There are no theoretical results on the properties of the proposed approach. However, given the large body of literature when it comes to the analysis of SMC methods I would expect that you can provide some results via the nice bridge that you have identified.\n2. Would this be possible to implement in a real-world setting with real-time requirements?\n3. A very detailed question when it comes to Figure 5.2 (right-most plot), why is the performance of your method significantly degraded towards the end? It does recover indeed, but I still find this huge dip quite surprising.\n\nMinor details:\n* The initial references when it comes to SMC are wrong. The first papers are:\nN.J. Gordon, D. Salmond and A.F.M. Smith, Novel approach to nonlinear/non-Gaussian Bayesian state estimation, IEE Proc. F, 1993\nL. Stewart, P. McCarty, The use of Bayesian Belief Networks to fuse continuous and discrete information for target recognition and discrete information for target recognition, tracking, and situation assessment, in Proc.

Kitagawa, Monte Carlo filter and smoother for non-Gaussian nonlinear state-space models, JCGS, 1996 \n* When it comes to the topic of learning a good proposal for SMC with the use of variational inference the authors provide a reference to Gu et al. (2015) which is indeed interesting and relevant in this respect. However, on this hot and interesting topic there has recently been several related papers published and I would like to mention:\nC.

AutoEncoding Sequential Monte Carlo. arXiv:1705.10306, May 2017.\n\nI would like to end by saying that I really like your idea and the way in which you have developed it. I have a feeling that this will inspire quite a lot of work in this direction.", "rating": "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
