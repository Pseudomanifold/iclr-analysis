{"title": "More work/evaluation on the SMC part needed", "review": "This paper proposes a sequential Monte Carlo Planning algorithm that depicts planning as an inference problem solved by SMC. The problem is interesting and the paper has a nice description of the related work. In terms of the connection between the the problem and Bayesian filtering as well as smoothing, the paper has novelty there. But it is unclear to me how the algorithm proposed is applicable in complex continuous tasks as claimed.\n\nIn the introduction, the authors wrote that \"We design a new algorithm, Sequential Monte Carlo Planning (SMCP), by leveraging modern methods in Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC), Bayesian smoothing, and control as inference\". From my understanding, the SMC algorithm adopted is the bootstrap particle which is the simplest and earliest SMC algorithm adopted. The Bayesian smoothing algorithm described is also standard. I do not see the modern parts of these algorithms.\n\nThe experiment section reports the return, but it is unclear to me how the SMC algorithm in this case. For example, what is the effective sample size (ESS) in these settings?\n\nThe experiment described seems to be a 2-dimensional set up. How does the algorithm perform with a high-dimensional planning problem?\n\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
