{"title": "Can be an accept if they do more analyses", "review": "This paper presents a new way to represent a dense matrix in a compact format. First, the method prunes a dense matrix based on the Viterbi-based pruning. Then, the pruned matrix is quantized with alternating multi-bit quantization. Finally, the binary vectors produced by the quantization algorithm are further compressed with the Viterbi-based algorithm. It spots the problem of each existing approach and solve the problems by combining each method. The combination is new and the result is encouraging.\n\nI find this paper is interesting and I like the strong results. It is an interesting combination of methods. However, the experiments are not enough to show that the proposed method is really needed to achieve the results. If these are answered well, I'd be happy to change my evaluation.\n\n1. The method should be compared with other combinations of components. At least, it should be compared with \"Multi-bit quantization only (Xu et al., 2018)\" and \"Multi-bit-quantization + Viterbi-based binary code encoding\".\n\n2. The experiments with \"Don't Care\" should go to the experiment section, and the end-to-end results should be present but not the ratio of incorrect bits.\n\n3. Similarly, the paper will become stronger if it has some experimental results that compare quantization methods. In Section 3.3., it mentions that the conventional k-bit quantization was tried and significant accuracy drops were observed. I feel that this is a kind of things which support the proposed method if it is properly assessed.\n\n4. When you say \"slow\" form something and propose a method to address it, I'd like to see some benchmark numbers. There is an experiment with simulation, but that does not seem to simulate the slow \"sequential sparse matrix decoding process\".\n\nMinor comments:\n\n* It was a bit hard to understand how a matrix is processed through the flowchart in Fig. 1 at first glance. It would help readers to understand it better if it has a corresponding figure which shows how a matrix is processed through the flowchart.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
