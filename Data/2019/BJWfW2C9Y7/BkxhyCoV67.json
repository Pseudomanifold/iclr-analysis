{"title": "The Analysis seems incorrect", "review": "The paper proposes to use an estimate of the 'local' smoothness constructed by taking the difference of the gradients along the previous step. This is a simple idea and has been considered before in literature. The authors seem to take a very simplistic approach to the problem which seems to not work at all in high dimensions. I am reasonable certain that the analysis is incorrect as it is impossible to get linear convergence via SGD or even with GD in general settings. Looking at the proof which is written in a very unreadable way reveals that they make multiple assumptions which holds basically in the case of a quadratic and then further only in one dimension. In which case such a rate with GD is trivial. \n\nSo the theory is blatantly wrong. Regarding the experiments they also look shaky at best and sometimes they diverge. I believe the paper is much below standard for ICLR. ", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
