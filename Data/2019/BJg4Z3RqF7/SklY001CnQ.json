{"title": "UNSUPERVISED ADVERSARIAL IMAGE RECONSTRUCTION", "review": "The authors address the problem of recovering an underlying signal from lossy and inaccurate measurements in an unsupervised fashion. They use a GAN framework to recover plausible signals from the measurements in the data. \n\n* Authors need to test other datasets, CelebA dataset is too limited. \n* Similarly, the experiment with different corruption processes are required. \n* What is a definition of F. It is not clear \"measurement process\".\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
