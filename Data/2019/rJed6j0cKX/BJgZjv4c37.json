{"title": "Constraining models to enable approximate posterior inference", "review": "The authors propose in this paper an approach for learning models with tractable approximate posterior inference. The paper is well motivated (fast and accurate posterior inference) and the construction of the solutions (invertible architecture, appending vectors to input and output, choice of cost function) well described. From my understanding, it seems this method is also to be compatible with other methods of approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC).\nConcerning the experimental section:\n- The Mixture of Gaussians experiment is a good illustration of how the choice of cost functions influences the solution. However, I do not understand how are the *discrete* output y is handled. Is it indeed a discrete output (problem with lack of differentiability)? Softwax probability? Other modelling choice? \n- The inverse kinematics is an interesting illustration of the potential advantage of this method over conditional VAE and how close it is to ABC which can be reasonably computed for this problem.\n- For the medical application, INN outperforms other methods (except sometimes for ABC, which is far more expensive, or direct predictor, which doesn\u2019t provide uncertainty estimates) over some metrics such as the error on parameters recovery (Table 1), calibration error, and does indeed have a approximate posterior which seems to correspond to the ABC solution better. I\u2019m not sure I understand what we are supposed to learn from the astrophysics experiments.\nThe method proposed and the general problem it aims at tackling seem interesting enough, the toy experiments demonstrates well the advantage of the method. However, the real-world experiments are not necessarily the easiest to read. \nEDIT: the concerns were mostly addressed in the revision.
