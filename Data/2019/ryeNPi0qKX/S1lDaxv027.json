{"title": "Well done with few surprises", "review": "\nI have mixed feelings about this paper. On one hand, it\u2019s a thorough and well-written experimental paper, something which is really important but is also clearly underappreciated in the machine learning community. On the other, it was not really obvious to me why some of objectives tested here are interesting: LM objectives like ELMo have seen a lot of uptake in the NLP community (and this is definitely an NLP paper), but most of the others\u2014like skip-thought, MT, and autoencoders\u2014have not. So the basic research question doesn\u2019t seem like an especially burning one. The trends in Fig. 2 show that these alternatives underperform an LM objective, which suggests that the NLP community can keep using that objective without worry\u2014and everything else in the figure seems as we would expect. \n\nIn short, I think the paper is a well-done study on a hypothesis of perhaps minor interest. The results are sensible but confirm what we already strongly suspected, and they seem unlikely to strongly influence other research, since they confirm that everyone has been the right thing all along. I\u2019m not entirely sure what I learned from this.\n\nTo me, the most interesting experiment is the final one in Section 6. This experiment seems like it could be the germ for a far more interesting paper getting at how these pretraining objectives help with downstream tasks. As it stands, it feels like an interesting nugget tacked on to an otherwise complete (and much less interesting) paper.\n\nPresentational comments:\n\nFig.1: really nitpicky, but the typography of the POS tags and CCG categories is all wrong. These aren\u2019t mathematical symbols!\n\nFig 2. Slightly confused why these are broken up into two separate plots.\n\nFig 4. is hard to read due to the lurid colors and patterns, which require a lot of cross-referencing with the legend. I wonder if this would be better as simply a table. I also found it very confusing at first since the y-axes are out of sync between the two figures\u2014initially it looked as if the legend was overlaid on a set of bars in the left figure that had the same baseline as the right figure. \n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
