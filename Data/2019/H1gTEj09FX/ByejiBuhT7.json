{"title": "Principled method with good results", "review": "Summary:\nThis paper combines the benefits of using joint steerable filters (using the SO(2) group) for designing rotation-equivariant CNNs with those of decomposing the filters (using Fourier-Bessel bases) for reducing the computational complexity. In addition, this leads to a compressed model and filter regularization. The authors give theoretical guarantees on the rotation equivariance and representation stability with respect to in and out of plane rotation. Empirical results show that the model attains better accuracy compared to CNNs and non-rotation-equivariant deep networks while using fewer parameters and also performs similarly to a rotation-equivariant model with much bigger capacity.\n\nPros:\n- Theoretical guarantees, elegant approach\n- Good empirical results compared to other models\n- Desirable properties: rotation-equivariance, lower computational complexity, fewer parameters, robustness and guaranteed stability to deformations\n\nCons:\n- Somewhat incremental technical novelty: combination of two previously published methods (Qiu et al. 2018 & Weiler et al. 2017)\n\nComments:\n1. I believe the related work section can be improved by explaining more clearly the connection between your work and the cited ones and emphasizing the advantages and limitations of RotDCF compared to other methods In particular, a reader should be able to precisely understand what is the novelty of this work is and what were the technical challenges in combining previously published ideas (such as DCF and SFCNN) \n2. How do you determine the truncation in practice? How robust is the method to this choice? What are the trade-offs between using a value that is too low or too high? It would be interesting to show how performance and complexity vary with this parameter\n3. It would also be helpful to have a discussion on choosing the parameters K_{alpha} and N_{theta} and how this affects the performance, computational complexity and number of parameters. This would provide more intuition on the limits of this method and the types of data it can be used for\n4. In section 2.3, it would be helpful to specify an estimated range for the parameter reduction from the non-bases rotation-equivariant CNN to RotDCF (similar to the \u00bd factor from RotDCF to regular CNN) \n5. Eq. (4) seems to be missing the definition of R_{m,q}\n6. The notation for the supplementary material was confusing at times. I would suggest using the more standard notation for the appendix which can also be a more specific reference (e.g. A.1, A.2, etc.)\n\n\n\n\n\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}
