{"title": "Method for pruning networks with global network saliency computed for the entire dataset", "review": "This paper proposes a method for pruning CNNs, which considers all filters globally. It normalizes the weights of a filter within a layer and globally across all layers. To incorporate the effect of the data set, the authors additionally compute the normalized gradients and multiply the weight term with it. The third concept that the authors introduce is the idea of accumulating this measure of the importance of a filter for one entire epoch, before pruning.\n\nThe paper is missing an important citation: \"Pruning Convolutional Neural Networks for Resource Efficient Inference\", Molchanov, et al., 2017, which previously introduced many of the concepts proposed in this submission. For example, Molchanov, et al., propose the magnitude of the product of the activation and its gradient as the criteria for pruning. They derive mathematically as to how their criterion relates to the expected change in the overall loss via the Taylor series expansion. They additionally emphasize the importance of normalizing the criterion across network layers and the importance of greater number of updates to the network before pruning for better results. It is important that authors of this submission clearly compare and differentiate their work from the previous very closely related work of Molchanov et al.\n\nAdditionally, in order to understand the contribution of each of the concepts that the authors introduce, i.e., accumulation of saliency, multiplication with gradients, normalization within a layer, normalization across layers, the authors should present ablation studies to show the affect of each of these concepts independently to the overall accuracy of their approach.\n\n\n\n\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
