{"title": "Good paper, some additional experiments would make it stronger", "review": "This work proposes to use semantic knowledge about the relationships and functionality of different objects, to help in navigation tasks, in both familiar and unfamiliar situations. The paper is very well written and it is clear what the authors did. The approach seems sound, and while it combines two existing approaches (actor-critic reinforcement learning for navigation, and belief propagation using graph convolution networks) is sufficiently novel to be of interest to at least some members of the community. The experimental evaluation is good, and the proposed method outperforms Mnih 2016 by a significant margin, especially in the more interesting settings. A good ablation study is provided. \n\nMy main concern is that there seems to be a larger pool of work in semantic navigation than what the evaluation includes. Anderson 2018, Zhu 2017 and Gupta 2017 seem relevant. While none of these use knowledge graphs, some of these show they outperform Mnih 2016 so would be stronger baselines. \n\nI am also curious whether the proposed work generalizes across scene type categories (e.g. if it learns on kitchens but it tested on living rooms). This would be an experiment in the spirit of unknown object/scene but even more challenging.
