{"title": "logical new approach to covariate shift problem", "review": "Authors present a new normalization technique called Equi-Norm and experimentally show its fast convergence properties over its popular competitors Batch-norm and Group-norm. The main idea in the paper is the EquiNorm method modifies the weights of a layer before forward propagating through it such that the contribution from positive and negative kernel weights to the output is same. In the experimental section, their approach is shown to be more accurate than Batch-norm and group norm on all datasets except, Imagenet. Is there any reasoning why this method performed slightly poorly on this particular dataset.\n\nQuality:\nResults are convincing and comprehensive; authors compare their proposed approach to major two baseline normalization frameworks and demonstrate improved performance.\n\nClarity:\nThe paper is well written for readers to understand however there are many grammar mistakes in multiple places.\n\nOriginality:\nThe work seems to be a logical new approach to covariate shift problem and as described above, I think the proposed method provides convincing results.\n\nI am personally not as familiar with normalization approaches so my confidence in the assessment is low; my main experience is in the computer vision for autonomous driving and sparse coding.\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess"}
