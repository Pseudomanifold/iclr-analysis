{"title": "Review", "review": "This paper suggests that \"attention shift\" is a key property behind failure of adversarial attacks to transfer. The authors propose an attention-invariant attack method by using a Gaussian filter on the gradient step before applying it. This method is shown to circumvent several defenses.\n\nComments: The method is interesting and evidently effective. However, the reason behind so-called \"attention shift\" being behind these defenses is hard to see---more likely, I suspect that the attack is exploiting a property similar to those used in [1]. Furthermore, the paper uses neural networks' shift invariance heavily in the proofs, which has shown to be not true [2,3]. The paper also has many typos and some broken references, which affect the readability of the work.\n\nMy main comment is that this work requires (a) more substantiation of the claim that attention shift is the phenomenon at play when it comes to lack of transferability, (b) improvement to the writing, and (c) more motivation behind the choice of mitigation mechanism.\n\nSmaller comments:\n- page 2 paragraph 3 line 3 \u201ccomposed of an legitimate\u201d: a instead of an\n- page 3 paragraph 1 line 3 \u201canother line of works that perform attacks\u201d work instead of works and performs instead of perform\n- page 3 paragraph 1 line 6 missing reference\n- page 3 paragraph 2 line 3,4 missing reference\n- page 4 paragraph 2 in section 3.2, and last sentence of pg 4: meaning is very unclear, needs rewriting\n- page 7 paragraph 3 in section 4.3 line 2 \u201cIt should by noted\u201c: be rather than by\n\n[1] https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.07397.pdf\n[2] https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.09115.pdf\n[3] https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.02779.pdf", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
