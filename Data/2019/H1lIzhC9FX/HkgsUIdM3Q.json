{"title": "Good work on how to prioritize the use of neurons in memory", "review": "As a paper on how to prioritize the use of neurons in a memory this is an excellent paper with important results. \n\nI am confused by the second part of the paper an attached GAN of unlimited size. It may start out small but there is nothing to limit its size over increased learning. It seems to me in the end it becomes the dominate structure. You start the abstract with \"able to learn from a stream of data over an undefined period of time\". I think it would be an improvement if you can move this from an undefined time/memory size to a limited size for the GAN and then see how far that takes you.
