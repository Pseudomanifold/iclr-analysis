{"title": "There may exist an error on the proof of Stochastic RMSProp.", "review": "There may exist an error on the proof of Theorem 3.1 in appendix. For the first equation in page 13, the authors want to estimate lower-bound of the term $E<\\nabla{f}(xt),V_t^{-0/5}*gt>$. The second inequality $>$ may be wrong. Please check it carefully.  (Hints: both the index sets { i | \\nabla{f}(xt))_{i}*gt_{i} <0 } and { i | \\nabla{f}(xt))_{i}*gt_{i} >0 } depend on the random variable $gt$. Hence, the expectation and summation cannot be exchanged in the second inequality.)", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
