{"title": "Interesting theory paper, needs emphasis on usefulness in practice.", "review": "The authors introduce concept of q-calculus into neural networks along with its advantages. They define a family of stochastic activation functions based on standard functions together with q-calculus.\n\nI have a single question, if the proposed stochastic activation functions can also be achieved through deterministic neurons together with noise schemes like dropout (or any others)? If yes, is it still useful to use q-neurons. sorry, if I missed something obvious.\n\nAs mentioned by the authors the experiments only showcase a slight improvement in performance which may not be consistent when tried across larger set of experiments.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
