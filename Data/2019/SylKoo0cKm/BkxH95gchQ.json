{"title": "Could use more motivation but it is a good concept.", "review": "The idea is nice. It is well aligned with tools that are needed to understand neural networks. However, the experiments feel like they are missing motivation as to why this method is being used. The paper does not provide very significant evidence that this method is useful. The negation example is nice but this doesn't seem to display the potential power of the method to understand a neural network.\n\nMore motivation for experimental section is needed. If the authors don't discuss a motivation then how will a reader know how to apply the tool? It seems there is no conclusion to take away from the experiments in section 5 (convolutions). \n\nThe authors should rethink the structure of the experimental section from the standpoint of convincing someone to use this method. In section 4.1 the authors have a good discussion on what is wrong with other methods in order to motivate their approach but then they don't deliver significant evidence in the later part of the section.\n\nThe paper needs more discussion and experiments to explain how and why to use this approach. \n\nWhile the authors say \"attributing a deep network\u2019s prediction to its input is well-studied\" they don't compare directly against these methods. \n\nThere are many typos and grammar errors\n\nWhile I think the paper could be much more impactful if the experimental section was greatly reworked; I believe the first 5 pages of the paper are a very good contribution and it should be accepted.\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
