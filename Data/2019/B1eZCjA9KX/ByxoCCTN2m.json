{"title": "The main novelty claim is not valid: non-deterministic oracles have been previous used for incremental semantic parsing", "review": "This paper proposes the use of non-deterministic oracles, also known as dyamic oracles or expert policies for incremental text2sql parsing, a kind of semantic parsing task. However this has been done by a number of authors:\n\n- Vlachos and Clark (2014): http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/Q14-1042\n- Berant and Liang (2015): https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/berant-liang-tacl2015.pdf\n\nwhile the idea of using such oracles for structured prediction tasks in NLP was first proposed by Daume III et al. 2009:\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/0907.0786\n\nFurthermore, it has been applied for RNN decoding in NLP, see: \nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06732\n\nApart from this, some further comments:\n- The subset of SQL tackled in this paper is less expressive than what has been done in previous work on ATIS and GeoQuery datasets. The claim about the high diversity of WikiSQL dataset used should be supported with evidence from the data.\n- The results on ATIS are not compared against any of the numerous works on it, so it is impossible to appreciate them. Luke Zettlemoyer has done a lot of work on this dataset, a comparison should be possible.\n- If the only reason the predicted query doesn't match the gold is the ordering of the columns, this should be straightforward to handle programmatically. Execution match can mask incorrect queries, eg. adding further conditions that were not expressed in language but didn't affect the results of the execution would be forgiven.\n- It is odd that the full oracle doesn't really work without the execution graph.", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
