{"title": "interesting  topic; potential technical error.  ", "review": "The paper proposes a multi-modal VAE with a variational bound derived from chain rule. \n\nPros:\nIt is an interesting and important research direction. \nThe presentation is in general clear. \n\nCons:\n1. The re-visit of JMVAE seems not precise. The JMVAE should bound the joint p(a, b) not log p(a|b)p(b|a).\n2. Due to the potential misunderstanding of JMVAE, the paper uses the JMVAE bound for log p(a|b) + log p(b|a) in equation (5), which seems wrong. \nEquation (4) &(5) itself seems confusing alone. It says L_m = log p(a,b) in (4) then L_m = log p(a|b) + log p(b|a) in (5).\n3. If I am not mistaken the error above, the proposed bound is in fact wrong. \n4. Assume that the method is correct, with a massive amount of beta:s, I doubt the method would be very sensitive to beta tuning. The experiments just presented some examples of different betas. Quantitive evaluation of beta and performance is needed. \n5. To generate multi-modal data, other methods such as VAE-CCA or JMVAE are able to that as well. It is not unique to the proposed method. \n6. The experiments are very toyish. The multi-modal data were generated. The method should be evaluated with a real-world benchmarking multi-modal dataset.
