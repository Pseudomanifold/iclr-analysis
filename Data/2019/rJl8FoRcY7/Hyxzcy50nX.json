{"title": "Disjointed paper on an interesting topic", "review": "This paper introduces a new VAE model (JMVAE) for multi-modal data with a\nshared latent representation. An method is also introduced to synthetically\ncreated bi-modal datasets with correlated latent representations.\n\nThe writing was a little awkward to follow at times, and I'm still not\nsure what \u0399 am suppose to take away from the figures plotting the latent\nrepresentation. The evaluation is fairly qualitative and it's difficult to\nunderstand what we achieving from using JMVAE.\n\nI'm not clear what the contribution of this work provides, as there is already\nplenty done on learning multi-modal representations.\n\nOne weakness with this work is all the examples are fairly toy\nproblems. The article motivates the work as combining raw multi-modal\nsensor datasets, but no real tasks are shown.\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}
