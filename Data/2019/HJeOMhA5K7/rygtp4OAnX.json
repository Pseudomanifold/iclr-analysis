{"title": "A modified column network", "review": "This work proposes a variant of the column network based on the injection of human guidance. The method does not make major changes to the network structure, but by modifying the calculations in the network. Human knowledge is embodied in a defined rule formula. The method is flexible and different entities correspond to different rules. However, the form of knowledge is limited and simple. Experiments have shown that the convergence speed and results are improved, but not significant.\n\nMinor\uff1a\nExample 2: \"A\" -> \"AI\".", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
