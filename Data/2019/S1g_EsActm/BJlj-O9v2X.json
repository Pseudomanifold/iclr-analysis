{"title": "Another architecture variant of ConvNets without sufficient experimental benchmark", "review": "I was excited about the title and abstract but my expectation started to fall as I parsed through the main text. Here are some of my major concerns:\n\n1. The entire text is plagued by syntax errors that sometimes inhibit the narrative and prevent the proper understanding.\n\n2. Section 3 explains the architecture clearly, but fails to justify, perhaps in theory or at least in intuition, why AIN could have any advantage with such a distinct choice of parameterization. Nor can I find any solid evidence from the experiments that this is indeed the case. \n\n3. Section 4 seems ad-hoc, simply presenting tables without ablation study makes it hard to trust the proposed architecture.\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
