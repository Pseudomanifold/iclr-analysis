{"title": "Nice work. Will the work be open source ?", "review": "This paper addresses a novel variant of AutoML, to automatically learn and generate optimization schedules for iterative alternate optimization problems. The problem is formulated as a RL problem, and comprehensive experiments on four various applications have demonstrated that the optimization schedule produced can guide the task model to achieve better quality of convergence, more sample-efficient, and the trained controller is transferable between datasets and models. Overall, the writing is quite clear, the problem is interesting and important, and the results are promising. \n\nSome suggestions:\n\n1. What are the key limitations of AutoLoss ? Did we observe some undesirable behavior of the learned optimization schedule, especially when transfer between different datasets or different models ? More discussions on these questions can be very helpful to further understand the proposed method.  \n\n2. As the problem is formulated as an RL problem, which is well-known for its difficulty in training, did we encounter similar issues? More details in the implementation can be very helpful for reproducibility. \n\n3. Any plan for open source ?
