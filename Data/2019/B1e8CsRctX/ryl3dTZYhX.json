Given the buildup, and given the other well-known training issues about GANs, are they the right choice for the basic modeling units, i.e. the ensemble units, in such case? A GANs adversary bases its comparisons on individual data points, rather than on distribution comparisons or on groups of points like MMD, etc. I understand the reasoning behind the choice of generative models (GMs), but it is choosing GANs out of the set of GMs in this particular case that I am referring to. \n\n- The paper is quite well written. The ideas as well as the reasoning flow very smoothly. \n\n- Experiments are well prepared. \n\nRather minor:\n- page 1: \"When training and test distributions differ, neural networks may provide ...\" This is true but may be a clarification here regarding the fact that the neural networks involved with several modeling problems, e.g. the ones trained for domain adaptation or meta-learning tasks, target this shift or difference in domains, and typically provide a way to tackle this problem.\n\n\n\nUodate: Read the rebuttal. My score remains unchanged.
