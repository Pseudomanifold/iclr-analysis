{"title": "Deep dependent continual leaning scenario looks interesting.", "review": "The paper proposes a novel architecture in the context of multitask learning and deep dependency structure. They try to solve their target issue in reinforcement learning, thus utilize the useful architecture UVFAs (Schaul et al.) since the model is effective to manage multiple policies into single value function. \n\nThe paper is easy to follow, but with quite long explanation. They verify their architecture UNICORN in various learning scenarios, i.e., multitask-learning, generalization to related tasks, and continual learning. And I have several remarks,\n\n- In the learning scenario, I confused that it looks a little bit far from the common definition of continual learning which is referred in machine learning area(learning various tasks in sequence, not simultaneously) but is more like an attribute learning or something.\n\n- It is ambiguous to ensure that the proposed architecture can show state-of-the-art or comparable performance. The compared baselines, such as glutton and random, look too simple and show minor performance as already described in the paper.\n\nThe deep dependency structure setting is quite interesting, also there are many useful discussion and imposing experiments. It would be great to see much clear competitiveness and identity of the architecture.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
