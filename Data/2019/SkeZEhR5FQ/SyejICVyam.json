{"title": "The authors proposed an end-to-end trainable framework for joint representation learning and graph decomposition. The proposed method achieved on-par performance consistently across classes.", "review": "The paper is very well written and the motivation of the end-to-end trainable framework for graph decomposition problem is very clear and strong. The proposed method is also fairly novel, especially the decision to convert the discrete optimization problem to an unconstrained binary cubic problem. \nFinally, the proposed method applied to human pose estimation achieves on par performance with the state-of-the-art performance on the MPII Human Pose dataset.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
