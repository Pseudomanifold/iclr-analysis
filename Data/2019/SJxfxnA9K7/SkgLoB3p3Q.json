", "review": "This paper presents a new method for incorporating conditional information into a GAN for structured prediction tasks (image conditioned GAN problems). The proposed method is based on fusing features from the generated and conditional information in feature space and allows the discriminator to better capture higher-order statistics from the data. The proposed method also increases the strength of the signals passed through the network where the real or generated data and the conditional data agree. The proposed method is conceptually simpler than joint CNN-CRF models and enforces higher-order consistency without being limited to a very specific class of high-order potentials. Thorough experimental results on Cityscapes and NYU v2 verify the efficacy of the proposed method.  I believe this paper shows a promising approach to solve the structured prediction problems that I have not seen elsewhere so far. The paper is written clearly, the math is well laid out and the English is fine.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
