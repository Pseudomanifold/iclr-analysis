{"title": "Evaluation and judgement", "review": "The paper presents an approach for an approach to addressing multi-goal reinforcement learning, based on what they call \"one-step path rewards\" as an alternative to the use of goal conditioned value function. \nThe idea builds on an extension of a prior work on FWRL. \nThe paper presents empirical comparison of the proposed method with two baselines, FWRL and HER. \nThe experimental results are mixed, and do not convincingly demonstrate the effectiveness/superiority of the proposed method. \nThe idea of the proposed method is relatively simple, and is not theoretically justified. \n\nBased on these observations, the paper falls short of the conference standard.
