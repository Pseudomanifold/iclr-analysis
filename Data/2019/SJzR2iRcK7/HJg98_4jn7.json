{"title": "The paper introduces some novel ideas but lacks elaborate justification.", "review": "In this paper the authors revisit the problem of multi-class classification and propose to use pairwise similarities (more accurately, what they use is the co-occurrence pattern of labels) instead of node labels. Thus, having less stringent requirements for supervision, their framework has broader applicability: in supervised and semi-supervised classification and in unsupervised cross-task transfer learning, among others.\n\nPros: The idea of using pairwise similarities to enable a binary classifier encapsulate a multi-class classifier is neat.\n\nCons: My main gripe is with the conditional independence assumption on pairwise similarities, which the author use to simplify the likelihood down to a cross-entropy. Such an assumption seems too simple to be useful in problems with complicated dependence structure. Yes, the authors conduct some experiments to show that their algorithms achieve good performance in some benchmark datasets, but a careful discussion (if possible, theoretical) of when such an assumption is viable and when it is an oversimplification is necessary (analogous assumptions are used in naive Bayes or variational Bayes for simplifying the likelihood, but those are much more flexible, and we know when they are useful and when not). \n\nSecondly, by using co-occurrence patterns, one throws away identifiability---the (latent) labels are only learnable up to a permutation unless external information is available. This point is not made clear in the paper, and the authors should describe how they overcome this in their supervised classification experiments.\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
