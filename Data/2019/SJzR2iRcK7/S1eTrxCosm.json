{"title": "Lacks citation to similar works in Statistics, topic modelling ...", "review": "The work is a special case of density estimation problems in Statistics, with a use of conditional independence assumptions to learn the joint distribution of nodes. While the work appears to be impressive, such ideas have typically been used in Statistics and machine learning very widely over the years(Belief Propagation,  Topic modeling with anchor words assumptions etc...). This work could be easily extended to multi-class classifications where each node belongs to multiple classes. It would be interesting to know the authors' thoughts on that. The hard classification rule in the paper seems to be too restrictive to be of use in practical scenarios, and soft classification would be a useful pragmatic alternative. \n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
