{"title": "High quality results but limited novelty. Need more evidence of improvements over previous methods", "review": "This paper proposed a new method for face completion using progressive GANs. The novelty seems very limited compared with previous methods. The results did not significantly outperform previous methods such as CTX in terms of visual quality. In addition, some of the features for the proposed method were not evaluated properly. \n\n1. The frequency attention module is not convincing. The visualization of the attention features look like normal feature in a neural network. Also, in Figure 8, the quality of results with and without FAM look very similar. These 4 images were selected from 3000 test images, but the difference is too small to show the benefit of FAM. \n\n2. In figure 8, it is unclear how the performance changes with each loss. Probably the results without L_bdy, L_rec, L_feat should be analyzed separately. \n\n3.  In figure 6, the results compared to CTX look similar. And the figure is too small to see the details. For example, from row 1, the result by CTX seems even better. \n\n4. How many images were used in the user study? Did each subjects evaluate the entire test set 3009 images? \n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
