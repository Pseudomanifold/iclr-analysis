{"title": "Interesting characterisation and extension of MNIST ", "review": "Authors present a set of criteria to categorize MNISt digists (e.g. slant, stroke length, ..) and a set of interesting perturbations (swelling, fractures, ...) to modify MNIST dataset. They suggest analysing performance of generative models based on these tools. By extracting this kind of features, they effectively decrease the dimmension of  data. Therefore, statistically comparing the distribution of generated vs test data and binning the generated data is now possible. They perform a thorough study regarding MNIST. Their tools are a handy addition to the analytical surveys in several applications (e.g. how classification fails), but not convincingly for generation. \n\nSince their method is manually designed for MNIST, the manuscript would benefit from a justification or discussion on the  common pitfalls and the correlation between MNIST generation and more complex natural image generation tasks. Since the presented metrics do not show a significant difference between the VAE and Vanilla GAN model, the question remains whether evaluating on MNIST is a good proxy for the performance of the model on colored images with backgrounds or not. For example sharpness and attending to details is not typically a challenge in MNIST generation where in other datasets this is usually the first challenge to be addressed. I'm not convinced that ability of a model in disentangling thickness correlates to their ability in natural image generation.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
