{"title": "violation of anonymity, poor writing", "review": "The paper contains an acknowledge section with people's names, which is a clear violation of anonymity. In addition, the submission obviously rushed and incomplete. The writing is very poor. There are only 7 references. The experimental results are limited to toy tasks, and the result section has only 8 lines. I don't think this paper worth a serious consideration at the current state.", "rating": "2: Strong rejection", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}
