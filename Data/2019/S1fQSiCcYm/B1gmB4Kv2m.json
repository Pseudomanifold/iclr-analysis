{"title": "An interesting regularized AE algorithm that improves interpolation in latent space", "review": "This paper proposed an adversarially regularized AE algorithm that improve interpolation in latent space. Specifically, a critic is used to predict the interpolation weight \\alpha and encourage the interpolated images to be more realistic. The paper verified the method on a newly proposed synthetic line benchmark and on downstream classification and clustering tasks.\n\nPros:\n1.\tA novel algorithm that promotes the interpolation ability of AE\n2.\tA new synthesized line benchmark to verify the interpolation ability of different AE variants\n3.\tStrong results on downstream classification and clustering tasks\n\nCons: \n1.\tThe interplay of the adversarial network (between AE and critic) isn\u2019t very clear and can be improved\n2.\tEq. 1, should x be x_1 or a new data other than x1 and x2?\n3.\tThe paper states that the 2nd term of Eq. 1 isn\u2019t crucial. If x is a new data (other than x1 or x2), how can the critic infer \\alpha without a reference to x1 or x2?\n4.\tThe paper states that \u201cencouraging this behavior also produce semantically smooth interpolation \u2026\u201d. Besides the empirical evidences from data, it would be better to any some theoretical justifications.\n", "rating": "9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
