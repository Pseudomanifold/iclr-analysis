{"title": "An application paper. No novelty. Very application (WiFi based localization) specific, so no generalizability.", "review": "This paper proposes a feature augmentation based approach for detecting concept drift. The particular application it deals with is WiFi-based indoor localization. Much of the paper is used to define the context and describe details of indoor WiFi based localization. A lot of space is also devoted to explaining Wifi data acquisition and other nitty-gritty details of data. The actual method for correcting concept drift is a trivial feature augmentation.\n\n I'd recommend the authors consider submitting this paper to an applied electronic communications conference where the topic and the scope of this paper might be more relevant. \n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
