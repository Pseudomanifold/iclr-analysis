{"title": "Paper was submitted to an inapproprate venue", "review": "It appears the paper has been submitted to the wrong venue. While it adresses features and uses machine learning, most of the paper is about a very technical way of handcrafting features for a specific problem. On the other hand, representation learning is about leaving the domain knowledge as much as possible to the machine, and building systems end-to-end. This approach is not reflected in the work at hand.\n\nWhile I cannot judge the significance and the validity of the approach, I am quite certain that the submission is not within the scope of ICLR and should be rejected.", "rating": "2: Strong rejection", "confidence": "1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess"}
