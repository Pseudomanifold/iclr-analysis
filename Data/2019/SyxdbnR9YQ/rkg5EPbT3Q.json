{"title": "Some practical experiments, but not enough novelty or rigour", "review": "While the authors claim \"The problem of concept drift in WiFi-based localization systems, was first mentioned in (Ghourchian\net al., 2017),\". the need for robustness of localisations to changes in the environment has been well known since the earliest implementations.\n\nWhat value is the reader supposed to get from Figure 5?\n\nMost of the machine learning techniques used in the paper are quite dated.\n\nI'm confused about \"Although the proposed feature space is almost resistant to concept\ndrifts, we incorporate incremental learning so that the model can adapt to new data without forgetting\nits existing knowledge, \" - if the system has changed the existing knowledge may be wrong and need to be forgotten?!\n\nThe paper needs a thorough proof-reading by a native English speaker.\n\nIn summary, while having run real experiments, the paper does not make a concrete conceptual contribution, and most of the practical elements are fairly basic, and the experimental aspects are not particularly rigorous.", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
