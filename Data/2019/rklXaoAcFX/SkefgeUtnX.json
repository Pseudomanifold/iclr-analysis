{"title": "geomstats has a potential to generate large impact to the community", "review": "This white paper presents the geomstats package. The package provides tools for Riemannian modelization and\noptimization over manifolds. Especially, the package supports several important manifolds: hyperspheres, hyperbolic spaces, spaces of SPD matrices or Lie groups of transformations. \n\nPros: \n1. the paper shows ever use cases of machine learning with manifolds. These use cases are concrete and representative. \n2. the code in the package is extensively tested. \n\nCons:\n\nThere is no discussion about the scalability of the package.
