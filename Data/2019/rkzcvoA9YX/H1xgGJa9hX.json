{"title": "Minor extension of the existing method", "review": "- In evaluation of omniglot, (\"a small improvement over the state-of-the-art should be considered as significant\") since all the results are already quite high, the small difference are not much beneficial in practice. Further, to justify the significance of the proposed method, a statistical test should be conducted and reported at least.\n\n- In comparison to the LearningToCompare, Sung et al\u2019s method compares the query image to all the support images, while the proposed method compares in a pairwise manner.  Thus, from a computational complexity perspective, the proposed method can be much expensive.\u0000\n\n- The statement of \"averaging the object relation features has similar effect as ensemble modeling\" needs theoretical or at least empirical supporting results along with explanations.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
