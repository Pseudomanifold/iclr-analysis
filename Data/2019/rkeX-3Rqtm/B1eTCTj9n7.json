{"title": "Contribution incremental and limited", "review": "The paper discusses a method for learning neural networks with hard-threshold activation. The classic perceptron network is a one-layer special case of this. This paper discusses a method called guided random local search for optimizing such hard-threshold networks. The work is based on a prior work by Friesen&Domingos (2018) on a discrete target propagation approach by separating the network into a series of Perceptron problem (not Perception problems as quoted by this paper). \nI feel the proposed method is mainly formulated in Equation (3), which makes sense but not very surprising. The proposed random local search is not very exciting either. Finally, the empirical results presented do not seem to justify the superiority of the proposed method over existing methods. Overall, the paper is too preliminary.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
