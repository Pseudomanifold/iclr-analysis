{"title": "Can the proposed defense is secure against pixel-based AEs?", "review": "The presented analysis well characterizes the behavior of the spatially transformed adversarial inputs and the proposed defense is empirically confirmed to achieve more accurate and robust classification under attacks.\n\nOne concern is that the defender cannot learn whether the adversary employs spatially transformed AEs or pixel-based AEs (or some others). What happens if the classifier trained with the proposed defense accept pixel-based AEs? I recommend the authors to associate spatially transformed AEs with pixel-based AEs to learn whether the proposed defense performs more robustly compared to existing defenses. If the proposed defense method performs well for spatially transformed AEs but is vulnerable to pixel-based AEs, it is useless.\n\nIt should be better to discuss more on computational efficiency of the proposed defense since it contains SDP solving. Is the proposed deense works with larger datasets such as CIFAR100 or ImageNet?\n\n \n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
