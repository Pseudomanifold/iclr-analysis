{"title": "Limited novelty compared to earlier work; poor presentation of results and conceptual differences between the proposed spatial transformation attack model vs. existing lp norm attack model", "review": "Summary: The paper studies a new attack model based on spatial transformations. The authors first formalize an attack model based on spatial transformation and then study attacks and defenses for this model. \n\nClarity: While the paper studies an important problem -- it's important to move out of the norm ball based attack models and consider different attacks like spatial transformations, in the current version, the presentation lacks clarity in both the formulation of the attack model, attacks, defenses and explanation of the results. For example, the impossibility result isn't clear: the claim is that any classifier has adversarial spatial transformations that are successful in causing misclassifcation for some threshold on the size of transformation. There is no explanation of how large this threshold is in practice. Is it small enough to be called an \"impossibility result\"? What does this threshold intuitively depend on?\n\nOriginality: The key contribution seems to be the formalization of some notion of spatial transformation. However, the final expression (Proposition 1) basically looks just like an l_p norm but after transforming it by some \"fixed\" matrix M. The expressions for this new attack model where || M r|| < \\eps for some perturbation \\eps look pretty similar to the case previously considered (where M was essentially identity). For example, Raghunathan et al. 2018 and Hein & Andriushchenko 2017. The paper is also missing discussion on the structure of this matrix M, and how it changes the attacks and defenses in practice\u00a0\n\nSignificance: I think the problem of spatial transformation based adversarial examples is important and the authors have the right goals. However, the current presentation makes it hard to understand the main results provided and hence I would rate that the contribution is not very significant. \n\nOverall: I highly recommend the authors to revise the presentation and clarify a) the main conceptual differences of the new attack model (matrix M of proposition 1) b) Formalize the impossibility and possibility results carefully with concrete theoretical/empirical results to back the claims", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
