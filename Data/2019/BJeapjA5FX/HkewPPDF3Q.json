{"title": "Interesting work but more comprehensive evaluations needed", "review": "This paper proposes geometrically robust networks (GRN), which applies geometric perspective and unsupervised model augmentation to transform traditional deep neural networks into adversarial robust classifiers. Promising experimental results against several adversarial attacks are presented as well.\n\nThe BNP-MFA are applied twice in the framework: one for getting the soft labels, and the other for getting the predictions through MAP estimation. There are existing works which are in the same line as the second part: deep kNN [1], and simple cache model [2] for example, where similarities to training examples are used to derive the test prediction and substantial increase of the robustness against adversarial attacks considered in this work have also been shown. \n\nThese raise two questions:\n(1) How much does the soft label encoding help increase the robustness?\n(2) How does the proposed model compare with the deep kNN and the simple cache model, which are much simpler?\n\nSome minor issues:\n- The unsupervised learning for label encoding is performed on the input space, the image pixel for example. But it is known that they are not good features for image recognition.\n- It is unclear which part of the network is considered as \"feature extraction\" part which is used for MAP estimation in the experiments.\n- It would be nicer to have results with different architectures.\n\n\n[1] N.
