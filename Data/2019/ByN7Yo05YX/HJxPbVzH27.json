{"title": "acceptable", "review": "\nThe authors proposed a new model Adaptive Neural Trees(ANTs) by combining the representation learning and gradient optimization of neural networks with architecture learning of decision trees. The key advantage of the new model ANTs  over the existing methods(Random forest, Linear classifier, Neural decision forest, et al) is: it may achieve high accuracy(above $90\\%$) with relatively much smaller number of parameters, as shown by the experiments on the datasets MNIST and CIFAR-10. Besides, the authors proposed single-path inference based on the greedily-selected leaf node to approximate the multi-path inferences with the full predictive distribution. The experiments show the single-path inference doesn't lose much accuracy but it saves memory and time. This paper is acceptable after minor modification.\n\n\nQuestions:\nIn the second line below equation (1), $n$ in $t_{e_{n(j)}}^{\\psi}$ is not defined. Also, should $t_{e_{1}}^{\\psi}$ be $t_{e_{n(1)}}^{\\psi}$? ", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
