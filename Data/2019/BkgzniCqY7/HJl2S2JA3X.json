{"title": "An interesting but not entirely novel contribution", "review": "The paper proposes a novel approach to generate adversarial examples based on structured sparsity principles. In particular the authors focus on the intuition that adversarial examples in computer vision might benefit from encoding information about the local structure of the data. To this end, lp *group* norms can be used in contrast to standard global lp norms when constraining or penalizing the optimization of the adversarial example. The authors propose an optimization strategy to address this problem. The authors evaluate the proposed approach on real data, comparing it against state-of-the-art competitors, which do not leverage the structured sparsity idea.\n\nThe paper is well written and easy to follow. The presentation of the algorithms for i) the non-overlapping and ii) overlapping groups as well as iii) the proposed refinement are clear. The experimental evaluation is interesting and convincing (the further experiments in the supplementary material add value to the overall discussion). \n\nThe main downside of the paper is that the proposed idea essentially consists in replacing the standard \\ell_p norm penalty/constraints with a group-\\ell_p one. While this provides interesting technical questions from the algorithmic perspective, from the point of view of the novelty, the paper does not appear an extremely strong contribution, \n\n\n\n ", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
