{"title": "Stable Opponent Shaping in Differentiable Games ", "review": "This paper introduces a new algorithm for differential game, where the goal is to find a optimize several objective functions simultaneously in a game of n players. The proposed algorithm is an interpolation between LOLA and LookAhead, and it perserves both the stability from LOLA and the \"convergence to fixed point\" property of LookAhead. The interpolation parameter is chosen in Section 3.2.\n\nThe paper looks novel, though some notations are not completely clear to me. For example, the defintions of the \"current parameters\" \\hat{\\theta}_1 and \\hat{\\theta}_2 in Section 3.1, and the stop-gradient operator. Also, how is the diag operator in Propostion 1 is defined? Normally it only represents the diagonal entries but here it might represent the diagonal blocks.\n\n\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess"}
