{"title": "Dropout", "review": "This is an interesting idea that seems to do better than regular dropout.\nHowever, the experiment seem a bit artificial, starting with less modern network designs (VGG) that can benefit from adding dropout. State of the art computer vision networks don't seem to need dropout so much, so the impact of the paper is unclear.\n\nSection 4.4: How does this compare to state-of-the-art network compression techniques? (Deep compression, etc)\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
