{"title": "Incremental, writing could be much improved", "review": "The paper proposes a generative infection cascade model based on latent vector representations. The main idea is to use all possible paths of infections in the model. \n\nComments:\n- The papers clarity could be much improved. It is not easy to follow, is overflowing with notation, and lengthy. Sec. 2.1 for example can easily be made much more concise. Secs. 3.1 and 3.2 are especially confusing. In the first equation in Sec. 3, what is \\phi with and without sub/superscript? In Eq. (2), what is k - a probability, or an index? And what is the formal definition \"infection\" and \"future\" in the description of k stating that it is \"the probability that u infects v in the future\"?\n\n- The authors mention that the actual infectors in a diffusion process are rarely observed. While this might be true, in many types of data include infection attempts. This should be worthwhile to model - there are many works on reconstructing cascades from partial data.\n\n- The authors note (rightly) the Eq. (9) is hard to solve, and propose a simple lower bound based on (what I think is) a decomposition assumption.  Unless I misunderstood, this undermines the contribution of the structure of past infections. Could the authors please clarify?\n\n- The results mention 5 (tables?), but only 4 are available, of which one appears floating on the last page.\n\n- Why are methods discussed in the introduction (e.g., DeepCas, Wang 2017a,b 2018) not used as baselines?\n\nMinor:\n- Wang 2017a and Wang 2017b are not the same Wang\n- Several occurrences of empty parentheses - ()\n- ", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
