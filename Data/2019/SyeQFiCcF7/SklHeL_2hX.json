{"title": "This paper has some new ideas about Capsule Network", "review": "In this paper, the author extends Capsule Network on the task of face verification to solve the problem of learning from only few examples and speeding the convergence. They propose a Siamese Capsule Network, which extends Capsule Networks to the pairwise learning setting with a feature l2-normalized contrastive loss that maximizes inter-class variance and minimizes intra-class variance. Here is a list of suggestions that will help the authors to improve this paper.\n1.\tThe pairwise learning setting allow learning relationships between whole entity encodings \n2.\tThe ability to learn from little data that can perform few-shot learning where instances from new classes arise during testing\n3.\tWhen a contrastive loss is used that takes face embeddings in the form of encoded capsule pose vectors, speed of converging is lifted.\n4.\tThe description of experiment is too brief to show specific details.\n5.\tThe figure of Siamese Capsule Network Architecture (figure 1) cannot show kernel of author(s)\u2019s method, and lack explanation in the paper.\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
