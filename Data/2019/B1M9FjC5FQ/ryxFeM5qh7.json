{"title": "interesting analysis on dropout", "review": "This paper gives further analysis on dropout and explains why it works although Hinton et al. already showed some analysis. This paper also introduced a new gradient acceleration in activation function (GAAF).\n\nOn Table 4, the GAAF is a bit worse than dropout although GAAF converges fast. But i am not sure whether GAAF is really useful on large datasets, not on a small dataset, e.g., MINIST here. On table 5, i am not sure whether you compared with dropout or not. Is your base model already including dropout?\n\nIf you want to demonstrate that GAAF is really helpful, i think more experiments and comparisons, especially on larger datsets should be conducted.\n\n\n\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
