{"title": "The authors propose an end-to-end trainable model which leveraged pair-wise relationships between objects to predict objects 3D shape and pose given a single 2D image.  The proposed method outperforms independent prediction approaches on two publicly available datasets.", "review": "The paper is well-written with a few figures to illustrate the ideas and components of the proposed method. However, one of the main components in the proposed method is based on Tulsiani et al. CVPR'18. The remaining components of the proposed method are not very new. Hence, I am not very sure whether the novelty of the paper is significant. Nevertheless, the performance of the proposed method is fairly good outperforming all baseline methods. \nI also have a few questions:\n1. How did you get the instance boxes, union boxes, and binary masks in testing?\n2. What are the training and inference time? ", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
