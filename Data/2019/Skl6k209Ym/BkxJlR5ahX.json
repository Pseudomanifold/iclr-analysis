{"title": "A new way of learning key point correspondence which can reflect visual concept", "review": "This paper proposed a new way of learning point-wise alignment of two images, and based on this idea, one-shot classification and open-set recognition can be further improved. The idea is interesting. As a human, when we say two images are similar, we may compare them locally and globally in our mind. However, traditional CNN models do not make direct comparisons. And this work give a good direction to further improve this motivation.\n\nThe paper is well written and easy to understand. \n\nFor the experiments, MNIST, Omniglot and MiniImageNet are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. From Figure 2. we can see many interesting correspondences.
