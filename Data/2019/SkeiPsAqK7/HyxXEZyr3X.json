{"title": "An engineering of existing components", "review": "Overall summary: \nThe authors of this manuscript propose to use the idea of dynamic routing between capsules, originally for image classification, to learn node embedding in graph data for node classification. The method was tested on six relational data sets.\n\nClarity: \nI am not convened that the dynamic routing between capsules for graph has similar implication as in computer vision. It is claimed that the CapsG model can preserve relative positions of nodes, but I believe it is straightforward to obtain the relative positions of nodes from just observing the graph structure. Why random walk is used? Is it necessary? Can the context nodes simply be defined within the Markov blanket of the target node? Furthermore, it is not mentioned in the manuscript how to compute the u_i vectors when feature vectors are not given. \n\nOriginality: \nIt is an extended work based on recent development of node embedding. Basically, it is a combination of random walk based methods and Hinton's first capsule net. Therefore, the originality of this work is not strong.\n\nSignificance: \nThe results obtained on six data sets are not impressive. Due to marginal gain in means and large variations on some data sets, it is difficult to say that the proposed method is significantly better than existing ones. Moreover, the authors mentioned that test nodes were removed when training in an inductive fashion. Were the validation nodes removed as well?\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
