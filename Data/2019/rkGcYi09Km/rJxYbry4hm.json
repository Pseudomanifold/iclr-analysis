{"title": "Novelty and advantage of the proposed methods are limited", "review": "The paper explores unsupervised deep learning model for extractive telegraphic summaries, which extracts text fragments (e.g., fragments of a sentence) as summaries. The paper is in general well structured and is easy to follow. However, I think the submission does not have enough content to be accepted to the conference.\n\nFirst, in term of methodology (as described in Section 3), the paper has little novelty. There has been intensive study using various deep learning models on summarization. The models described in the paper contain little novelty compared with previous work using autoencoder and LSTM for both extractive and abstractive summarization. \n\nSecond, the paper claims contributions on using deep learning models on telegraphic summarization, but the advantage is not well demonstrated. For example, the advantage of the resulting summary is not compared with state-of-the-art sentence compression models with intrinsic evaluation or (probably better) with extrinsic evaluation. (By the way, it is interesting that the paper argues the advantage of using telegraphic summaries for fictional stories but actually gives an example which looks also very typical in news articles (the \u201cearthquake Tokyo 12 dead\u201d example).)\n\nThird, there has been much work on speech summarization that summarizes with the \u201ctelegraphic\u201d style (this is natural, considering speech transcripts are often non-grammatical, and \u201ctelegraphic\u201d style summaries focusing on choosing informative fragments actually result in usable summaries.) The author(s) may consider discussing such work and compare the proposed methods to it.\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
