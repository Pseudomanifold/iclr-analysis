{"title": "The Claim is not supported appropriately. ", "review": "The authors try to provide an information-theoretic explanation of adversarial examples and claim that the possibility of making the redundant network is the key-aspect of the existence of adversarial examples. Unfortunately, the claim is not appropriately supported, and little intuition is provided for authors to make better algorithms tackling the adversarial examples.\n\nIn the paper, a network with minimal sufficient statistic is claimed to have no adversarial example (Contrapositive of Theorem 1), but the claim is far from making actionable ML processes which is mentioned as the contribution at the end of Section 1. How the practitioners can make ML processes from this claim of minimal sufficient statistic?\n\nThe entropy claim does not appropriately support the redundancy claim. Adding any noise will increase the entropy. Adversarial examples can have more entropy than original examples, but data with higher entropy do not necessarily contain adversarial examples. Entropy measure is not the key property of the existence of adversarial examples, and adversarial examples definitely have more entropy because noise is added.\n\nThe redundancy claims do not provide any novel intuition (and looks trivial), and the redundancy claim does not help improve actual algorithms.\n", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
