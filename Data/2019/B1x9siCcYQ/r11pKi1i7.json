{"title": "Interesting idea and fleshed-out experiments, but somewhat niche appeal.", "review": "The paper proposes node embedding methods for applications where nodes are sequentially related. An example application is the \"Wikispeedia\" dataset, in which nodes are connected in a graph, but a datapoint (a wikispeedia \"game\") consists of a sequence of nodes that are visited. Each node is further attributed with textual information.\n\nThe methods proposed are most closely related to skipgrams, whereby the sequence of nodes are treated like words in a sentence. Then, node attributes (i.e., text) and node representations must be capable of predicting neighboring nodes/words. (Fig.s 1/2 are a pretty concise overview of the proposed architecture).\n\nPositively, this is a quite sensible extension and modification of existing ideas in order to support a new (or different) problem setting.\n\nNegatively, I'd say the applications for this technique are fairly niche, which may limit the paper's readership. The method is mostly fairly straightforward and not methodologically groundbreaking (probably borderline in terms of expected methodological contribution for ICLR). I also didn't understand whether the theoretical claims were significant.\n\nThe wikispedia/physics experiments feel a bit more like proofs-of-concept rather than demonstrating that the technique has compelling real-world uses. The experiments are quite well fleshed-out and detailed though.\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
