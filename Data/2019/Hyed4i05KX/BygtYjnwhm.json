{"title": "Unpromising approach to an important problem, understanding processing in feed-forward MLPs", "review": "Pros\n\n1.\tThe paper is fairly clear.\n2.\tThe problem is important: analyzing the internal computations of layered networks.\n3.\tThe method seems to be a slight improvement on an existing method: the use of hierarchical clustering is nice.\n4.\tFigs. 3 and 5 superimposing the analyzed clusters on top of the network diagram are cool.\n\nCons\n\n5.\tThe paper wastes valuable space writing out in detail the equations for backpropagation in a standard feed-forward MLP.\n6.\tThe paper does not have an acceptable review of relevant prior work. This is particularly problematic as the proposal seems to be a rather small tweak to prior work of two 2018 papers by Watanabe et al. But there is extensive other literature attempting to address this problem, especially in the vision domain, where their main example - poor over-worked MNIST - resides.\n7.\tIn my view, attempts to understand processing in NNs exclusively at the individual-unit level are essentially doomed at the outset. These networks crucially represent their information in distributed representations and it is joint action by multiple units rather than action by individual units that drives processing. Consider the \u201ceffect\u201d variable analyzed in this paper, which is a simple correlation between the activity of a target hidden unit and the activity of a particular input or output unit. Suppose whenever hidden unit i is active, hidden unit j is also active, and vice versa. Now suppose j strongly drives output unit k via a connection with a large weight, while unit i has no connection at all to unit k. Then i will have a strong \u201ceffect\u201d on k! The correlations between the activity of i and k is the same as the correlation between j and k, even though the causal interaction between i and k is nil, while the causal interaction between j and k is strong. In this especially transparent situation, it is the joint action of i and j that matters, and it so happens that this joint action has no contribution from i.\n8.\tSo in addition to the problems arising from analyzing exclusively at the individual-unit level, there is the problem of defining \u201ceffect\u201d by correlation instead of causation.\n9.\tI don\u2019t myself gain any insight into how the MNIST network is working by looking at the clusters diagrammed in Fig. 4. There is no discussion of the fact that nearly all of their input-\u201ceffect\u201d maps look like a slanted oval which is either on-center-off-surround or the reverse (no comment on the superficial, at least, connection to the receptive fields of neurons in the early mammalian visual system). Just how do these cluster maps explain anything? \n10.\tThe maps for the other example, time-series of prices of root vegetables, are even more baffling, but, superficially at least, the input maps suggest the hidden units are doing Fourier analysis; even this obvious observation is not made in the paper, however.\n", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
