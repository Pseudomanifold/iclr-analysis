{"title": "A dialogue system that is novel in using graph convolutional networks as part of an encoder-decoder dialogue system with attention", "review": "This is a well-written paper (especially the introduction) with fairly extensive experimentation section. It'a very possitive for me that you resort to more than one set of figures of merit.\n\nMy concerns are: \n\nYou mention that GCNs have been used for question-anwering already. It would be infomative to furhter describe this work and clearly state how you handle things differenclty, since a Q&A system is quite close to a dialogue one.\n\nThere are some parts that could be made more clear. For example, when you mention that you collectively represent all trees as a single graph. How do you do that?\n\nThe model has a great number of parameters. It is not clear to me how you concluded to the specific parameter values. \n\nIt would be nice to add the complexity of the model and also be more specific about how you choose the parameter values.\n\nMy proposals are:\n\nI think that the paper would greatly benefit if you additionally to the equations you also presented the model in a graphical way as well. Additionally, although the paper is very well mathematically defined, is not so easy to follow from a practical perspective. For example, regarding section 5.3 I would prefer to see the 3 models you present in a graphical way as well.\n\nMaybe add the links to the datasets you are using? On a related subject, would your models be transferable accross datasets?\n\nMinor issues\nPPMI abreviation is first used and then defined.\nThere are also some typos, like conisdered (that I suppose was meant to be considered, for example)", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}
