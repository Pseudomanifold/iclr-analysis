{"title": "Interesting results, good direction to follow ", "review": "This paper aims to detect out-of-distribution pixels for semantic segmentation, which is a good direction for researchers in this field to explore. As the authors point out, recent semantic segmentation systems surpass 80% mIoU on Pascal VOC 2012  and  Cityscapes, which is a good achievement. Unfortunately, most existing semantic segmentation datasets assume closed-world evaluation which means that they require predictions over a predetermined set of visual classes. This work utilize data from other domain to detect undetermined classes, thus can model uncertainty better in an explicit way. I just have minor comments. \n\n1. When you perform training, do you train from scratch or from a pre-trained model? If using pre-trained model, then ILSVRC is not actually pure OOD pixels. \n\n2. How to interpret the results in Table 5? \n\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
