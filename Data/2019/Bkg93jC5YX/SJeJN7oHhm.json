{"title": "Review", "review": "This paper presents a new semi-supervised method for bilingual dictionary induction and proposes a new metric to measure isometry between embedding spaces.\n\nPros:\n- The paper proposes to use a new metric, the Gromov-Hausdorff distance to measure how isometric two word embedding spaces are.\n- The toy example is useful for motivating the use case of the method.\n- The approach achieves convincing results on the dataset.\n\nCons:\n- Beyond the isometry metric, the main innovation as far as I can see seems to be the hubness filtering, which is incremental and not ablated, so it is not clear how much improvement it yields. The weak orthogonality constraint has already been used in [2].\n- It is not clear to me what the proposed metric adds beyond the eigenvector similarity metric proposed in [1]. The authors should compare to this metric at least.\n- The authors might want to add the results of [3] for an up-to-date comparison.\n\n[1] S\u00f8gaard, A., Ruder, S., & Vuli\u0107, I. (2018).
