{"title": "Theoretical but not rigorous", "review": "In this paper, the effect of batch normalization to the maximum eigenvalue of the Fisher information is analyzed. The techinique is mostly developed by Karakida et al. (2018). The main result is an informal bound of the maximum eigenvalue, which is given without proof. Though, the numerical result corresponds to the derived bound.\n\nThe paper is basically well written, but the technical part has several notational problems. For example, there is no definition of \"\\otimes\", \"\\odot\", and \"Hess\" operators.\n\nThe use of the mean-field theory is an interesting direction to analyze batch normalization. However, in this paper, it seems failed to say some rigorous conclusion. Indeed, all of the theoretical outcomes are written as \"Claims\" and no formal proof is given. Also, there is no clear explanation of why the authors give the results in a non-rigorous way, where is the difficult part to analyze in a rigorous way, etc. \n\nAside from the rigor issue, the paper heavily depends on the study of Karakida et al. (2018). The derivation of the bound (44) is directly built on Karakida's results such as Eqs. (7,8,20--22), which reduces the paper's originality.\n\nThe paper also lacks practical value. Can we improve an algorithm or something by using the bound (44) or other results?", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
