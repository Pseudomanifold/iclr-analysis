{"title": "Intuitive and useful", "review": "Data augmentation is a useful technique, but can lead to undesirably large data sets. The authors propose to use influence or loss-based methods to select a small subset of points to use in augmenting data sets for training models where the loss is additive over data points, and investigate the performance of their schemes when logistic loss is used over CNN features. Specifically, they propose selecting which data points to augment by either choosing points where the training loss is high, or where the statistical influence score is high (as defined in Koh and Liang 2017). The cost of their method is that of fitting an initial model on the training set, then fitting the final model on the augmented data set.\n\nThey compare to reasonable baselines: no augmentation, augmentation by transforming only a uniformly random chosen portion of the training data, and full training data augmentation; and show that augmenting even 10% of the data with their schemes can give loss competitive with full data augmentation, and lower than the loss achievable with no augmentation or augmentation of a uniformly random chosen portion of the data of similar size. Experiments were done on MNIST, CIFAR, and NORB.\n\nThe paper is clearly written, the idea is intuitively attractive, and the experiments give convincing evidence that the method is practically useful. I believe it will be of interest to a large portion of the ICLR community, given the usefulness of data augmentation.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
