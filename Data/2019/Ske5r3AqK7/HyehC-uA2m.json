{"title": "Poincare Glove: Hyperbolic Word Embeddings", "review": "Summary: \nWords have implicit hierarchy among themselves in a text. Hyperbolic geometry due to the negative curvature and the delta-hyperbolicity is more suitable for representing hierarchical data in the continuous space. As a result it is natural to learn word representations/embeddings in the hyperbolic space. This paper proposes a promising approach that extends the approach presented in [1] to implement a GLOVE based hyperbolic word embedding model. The embeddings are optimized by using the Riemannian Optimization methods presented in [2]. Authors provide results on word-similarity and word-analogy tasks.\n\n\nQuestions: \nWhat are the reasons for choosing a Poincare Ball model of the hyperbolic space instead of hyperboloid or other models of the hyperbolic space?\nCan you expand on the role of gyr[.,.] in Equations 6 and 7.\nBesides the tasks that are presented in this paper including word-analogy and the word-similarity tasks. Have you considered using the embeddings learned in hyperbolic space in a down-stream task such as NLI? \n\nPros:\nThe paper is very well-written, the motivation and the goals are quite clear.\nThe relationship between the Gaussian embeddings and the product spaces is interesting and neat. The paper is theoretically strong and consistent.\nThe idea of learning word-embeddings in hyperbolic space with the proposed approach is novel and relevant.\n\nCons:\n\nThe weakest point of this paper is the experiments. Unfortunately the results reported are underwhelming on WBLESS and the Hyperlex tasks compared to other published results. The paper presents convincing results on Word-analogy and Word-similarity tasks. However they do not compare against the published results on those tasks.\n\n[1] Ganea, O.
