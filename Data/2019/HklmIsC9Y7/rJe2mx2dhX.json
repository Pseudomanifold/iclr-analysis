{"title": "not well-written, confusing with limited novelty", "review": "the paper proposes a neural architecture for the task of frame interpolation. It consists of two branches where the first branch interpolates the middle frame directly, while the second branch first extracts motion vectors which are refined using a flownet network and then goes to another network to interpolate the middle frame. In general, the paper is not easily understandable. descriptions are not clear and it's hard to understand the paper. terms are stated before they are defined (e.g. loss function in the second line of section 3). motivation is not clear. there are related works in both section 1 and 2. \ntechnical novelty is limited: the proposed method consists of encoder-decoder modules that are already introduced. the complexity of architecture is not justified in the experiments. \nthe performance improvement is marginal (table 2) and extra flownet, and interpolator network (table 3, 4) is not justified in term of contribution to performance.\n", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
