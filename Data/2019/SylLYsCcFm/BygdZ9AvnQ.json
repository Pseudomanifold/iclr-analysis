{"title": "Intuitive idea for improved training demonstrated powerful in the analogy domain", "review": "Cons\n\n1.\tIt\u2019s unclear why LABC produces lower scores than \u2018normal\u2019 training on \u2018normal\u2019 testing.\n2.\tThe text says nothing I can find to explain why in Fig 5 the \u2018entity\u2019 vectors have all 0s except in one dimension, which seems to make the problem considerably easier.\n3.\tIn a sense, there is no cross-domain adaptation required in the symbolic task: min is min, whether it operates on dimension k of the source vectors or dimension j of the target vectors. On the other hand, dimensions are processed independently in the model, as far as I can tell, so there\u2019s no free transfer of learning min on dimension k to knowing min on dimension j. It would be good to comment on this issue.\n4.\tThere seem to be obvious analogies (so to speak) to GANs, and it is very curious that this is not mentioned anywhere that I can see. This is particularly glaring in Sec. 5.3.\n5.\tThe quantitative results are scattered throughout the prose; it would be challenging, but worthwhile, to gather them into an actual table.\n\nPros\n\n6.\tThe basic idea (\u201cWe should aspire to select as negative examples those examples that are plausible considering the most abstract principles that describe the data\u201d, p. 14) is very intuitive, common-sensical, bordering on obvious. But it is not at all obvious that the idea has as much power as is demonstrated in the experiments. The transfer to novel domain combinations, novel domains, and novel values of dimensions is impressive and surprising.\n7.\tThe result that the proposed training, designed to promote generalization on analogy tasks, also seems to promote improved sensory processing is interesting. Whether it really instantiates the parallel connection argued for by the High-Level Perception view from psychology/philosophy is debatable, but that is itself an interesting connection that the authors should be praised for identifying.\n8.\tIn general, the connection to the cognitive literature is creative and tantalizing and provides good scientific grounding for the work.\n9.\tThe linking to the flexibility of word meanings in the final paragraph pushes the limit of the plausibility of connection to broader cognitive issues, but I\u2019m inclined to indulge the authors for at least bringing up this important and relevant issue.  \n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
