{"title": "Interesting theoretical contribution", "review": "The authors provide a common mathematical perspective on several learning algorithms for sequence models. They also introduce a new algorithm that combines several of the existing ones and achieves significant (but small) improvements on a machine translation and a text summarization task.\n\nThe paper is clearly written, giving a good exposition of the unifying formulation.\n\nI believe the paper is quite insightful, and contributes to the community's understanding of the learning algorithms. However, the improvements in their experiments are rather small, and could probably be improved with more experimental work. They do showcase the usefulness of their new formulation, but not very strongly. Thus my recommendation to accept the paper is mostly based on the theoretical content that opens an interesting new perspective.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
