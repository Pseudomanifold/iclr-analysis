{"title": "still needs improvement ", "review": "\nThe paper tackles the interesting problem of combining logical approaches with neural networks in the form of  translating a logical formula into a non-negative loss function for a neural network. \nThe approach is novel and more general than previous approaches and the math is sound. However, I feel that the method is not well presented. Sadly the introduction does not set the method into context or give a motivation. The abstract is very short and misses key information. Indeed, even the more technical parts sometimes lack clarity and assume familiarity with a wide range of methods. \n\nThe experiments are well thought out and show the promise of the method when encoding performance measures such as entropy into the constraints. It would have been interesting to additionally see other kinds of constraints such as purely logical formulas that do not have a specific aim (robustness or performance or otherwise) but simply state preconditions that should be fulfilled. It would furthermore be interesting to inspect the corner cases of the proposed method such as what happens if two constraints are nearly opposing each other and so on. \n\n\n\nTo conclude, the presented method is clearly novel and provides an interesting solution to a challenging problem. However the paper in the current form does not fully adhere to the standards of conferences such as ICLR. I suggest rewriting especially the abstract and the introduction and then submitting to a different venue as the approach itself seems promising. Additionally, as only very limited comparison experiments can be performed the method itself should be more thoroughly inspected by performing, for example, edge-case or time/number of constraints inspections.\n\nMinor remarks:\nHyperparameters such as batch size not reported\nSpelling mistake in line 2, page 2 \u201cLipschitz condition\u201d\nWhen mentioning \u201cprior work\u201d in the introduction a citation is needed.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
