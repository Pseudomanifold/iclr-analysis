{"title": "Incremental, but quite solid", "review": "In this paper, authors propose safe policy optimization algorithms based on the Lyapunov approach to constrained Markov decision processes.\nThe paper is very well written (a few typos here and there, please revise) and structured, and, to the best of my knowledge, it is technically sound and very detailed.\nIt provides incremental advances, mostly from Chow et al., 2018.\nIt fairly accounts for recent literature in the field.\nExperimental settings and results are fairly convincing.\n\nMinor issues:\nAuthors should not use not-previously-described acronyms (as in the abstract: DDPG, PPO, PG, CPO)", "rating": "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
