{"title": "Is it fair to compare the proposed algorithm to existing hashing algorithms and PQ", "review": "This paper proposed a new hashing algorithm with a new loss function. A multi-indexing scheme is adopted for search.  There is one key issue: in general hashing is not good at multi-indexing search for vector-based search in the Euclidean distance or Cosine similarity. The advantage of hashing is reducing the code size and thus memory cost, but it is still not as good as quantization=based approach. \n\nHere are comments about the experiments.\n(1) Table 1: do other algorithms also use multi-indexing or simply linear scan?\n(2)  Figure 4: HDT-E is better than PQ. It is not understandable. Something important is missing. How is the search conducted for PQ? Is multi-indexing used? It is also strange to compare the recall in terms of #(distance comparisons). \n\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
