{"title": "Review of Multi-way Encoding for Robustness to Adversarial Attacks  ", "review": "Authors proposes new method against adversarial attacks. Paper is organized well and easy to follow. Basically, authors notice that gradients of a deep neural network when one hot encoding is used can be highly correlated and hence can be used in the design on an attack. Authors supply extensive experimental evidence to support their method. Those experiments shows significant amount of gains compared to baselines. Although proposed method is neat, I believe it has room to be improved. One question which is bothering me is: Given that one hot encoding is not optimal, can one find optimal (highly resistant to any attack) encoding? One may use evolutionary computing to empirically analyse such a encoding or one may come up an existence/non-existence proof (I am not expert in the field however I guess ecoc field should have investigates similar problems) of such encoding.
