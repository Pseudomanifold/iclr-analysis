{"title": "network pruning in training", "review": "This manuscript presents a method to prune deep neural networks while training. The main idea is to use some regularization to force some parameters to have small values, which will then be subject to pruning. \nOverall, the proposed method is not very interesting. More importantly, the manuscript only lists the percentage of pruned parameters, but did not compare the actual running time before and after pruning.
