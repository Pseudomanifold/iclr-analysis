{"title": "Good idea, but the results are not particularly convincing", "review": "PROS:\n* Original idea of using separate \"discriminator\" paths for unknown classes\n* Thorough theoretical explanation\n* A variety of experiments\n* Very well-written, and clear paper\n\nCONS:\n* The biggest problem for me was the unconvincing results. MNIST-to-MNIST-M has better baselines  (PixelDA performed better on this task for example), Office is not suitable for domain adaptation experiments anymore unless one wants to be in a few-datasample regime or work with data with noisy labels(the dataset is plagued with label pollution, and there are too few examples per class per domain for NN-based domain adaptation); the results on CELL were not convincing, I don't know the dataset but it seems that baseline NN does better than DA most of the times.\n* Comparison with other methods did not take into account a variety of hyperparameters. Although I do understand the problem of evaluation in unsupervised DA, this should have at least been done in the semi-supervised case, and some analysis/discussion should be included for the unsupervised one. What if the proposed method performs that much better than baselines but they hyperparameters are not set correctly?", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
