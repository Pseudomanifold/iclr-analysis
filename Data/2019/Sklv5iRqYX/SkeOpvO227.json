{"title": "This paper has good presentation and sufficient contribution to the field", "review": "In this paper, the authors proposed a multi-domain adversarial learning approach, MULANN, to improve the classification accuracy on three datasets-DIGITS, OFFICE and CELL-in the semi-supervised DA setting. It\u2019s contributions include: i) using the H-divergence to bound both the risk across all domains and the worst-domain risk (imbalance on a specific domain); ii) a new loss to accommodate semi-supervised multi-domain learning and domain adaptation; iii) the experimental validation of the approach, improving on the state-of-the-art on two standard image benchmarks, and a novel bioimage dataset, CELL. \nIn addition, this paper has a clear logic to explain and prove the problem to be solved, and has ample experimental evidence. Above on, this paper did a meaningful work. But there are some errors of expression, so it should be checked.\n", "rating": "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
