{"title": "I worry that this defense will be easy to break", "review": "The authors propose that the \"checkerboard phenomenon\", whereby the gradients exhibit a repeating pattern over the pixel space, is a source of vulnerability to adversarial examples. They propose to first enhance this vulnerability for pre-trained models with a pre-conditioning layer, and then to evade it by zero padding the image to offset the pattern.\n\nClarity: I found the work difficult to follow in places, and I felt that some material crucial to the paper was relegated to appendices.\n\nOriginality: To my knowledge, the idea is original.\n\nQuality and significance:\nI feel the significance of this work is likely to be low. While the authors report positive \"defense\" results, I strongly suspect this is simply because the attacks considered did not uncover the defense strategy. I expect that this defense would be broken relatively quickly if the paper is accepted. The authors did not present evidence to suggest that their method reduces the probability that a misclassified example lies close to the training or test examples. As such, the defense seems to rely on the attacker being \"tricked\".\n\nSpecific comments:\n\n1) Throughout the paper, I was unclear what specific kinds of attacks the method was intended to defend against.\n2) In section 2.2, key definitions are relegated to appendix C.\n3) Section 3.2-> p = 0.3 is still 30% of the pixels. Could the authors provide a baseline with a random 30% of pixels?\n4) Adaptive attack scenario: I would recommend that the authors also included a measure of the attack-ability under random noise in the epsilon ball. This would demonstrate whether the defense actually removes adversarial examples or just \"attacks the attackers\".", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
