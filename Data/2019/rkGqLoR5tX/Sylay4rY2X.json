{"title": "Applying existing outlier detection techniques to the more informative features output by the NN layers", "review": "Summary\n-------\nThe paper applies an existing outlier detection technique (PLS - Partial Least Squares) to intermediate layer(s) of neural networks.\n\n\nMain Comments\n-------------\n\n1. The approach is similar to spectral anomaly detection where reconstruction error in lower dimensional space is used as the anomaly score. The higher layers of the neural network are good at identifying more informative features. Applying existing algorithms to these layers often improve algorithm accuracy. The proposed approach benefits from the same phenomena. The paper therefore lacks novelty.\n\n1. Section 4: \"...using MC-Dropout (Gal & Ghahramani, 2016) since it is well-established and straightforward to implement even though it has received criticism (Osband et al., 2016).\"\n\nThe benchmark methods are not state-of-the-art and were merely convenient to implement. Stronger benchmarks for anomaly detection techniques with images should be used. One traditional LOF variant relevant for comparison here is [1]. Other spectral techniques should also be considered.\n\n2. Section 4.2: \"...experiment, but both Mahalanobis distance and LOF fail to detect both cars and horses using 50 % R2\"\n\nThe comparison and the observation with R2 50% does not convey anything beyond obvious since it is already known that a factor as low as 50% looses almost half the information (variance in data).\n\nComparison of all various R2 (50, 80, 90, 95, 99)% factors is not relevant. These results might be presented for sensitivity analysis. Either the R2 should be fixed to a constant value (like 80 or 90% which performs well consistently) or a single value should be selected by automatic means. Currently, the experiments merely give an illusion of being rigorous without actually being so.\n\n3. The datasets and experiments are not sufficient. Std. errors are also not shown.\n\nReferences:\n[1] J. He, Y. Liu, and R. Lawrence. Graph-based Rare Category Detection.
