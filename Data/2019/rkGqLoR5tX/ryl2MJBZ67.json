{"title": "The paper studied interesting outlier detection algorithm but the novelty is limited", "review": "The paper studied interesting outlier detection algorithm but the novelty is limited.\nThis paper studies about the outlier detection under the neural network framework. However, it just applied the idea of partial least squares regression model on top of extracted features from the max-pooling layers of the CNN. The proposed approach is independent of any neural network or machine learning structure. The experiments are shown on fashion-mnist, cats and dogs and speech command recognition experiment using LSTM-model. This kind of direct application of the existing algorithm is not enough for publication in ICLR.
