{"title": "The contribution is limited", "review": "This paper targets at developing new DFA method to replace BP for neural network model optimization, in order to speed up the training process. The paper is generally written clearly and relatively easy to follow. \n\nMy main concern is about significance of the contribution of this paper.\n\n1. the novelty is limited. This paper only simply combines two well-known approach BP and DFA together. \n\n2. performance contribution seems not significant from the proposed approach. In the implementation, the authors only apply their approach to optimize a few top layers. A majority of the layers in the NN model are still optimized via BP. \n\n3. the authors should provide more evaluations on different NN backbones and datasets, to make the experiments stronger and more convincing.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
