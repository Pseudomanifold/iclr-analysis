{"title": "good paper", "review": " It seems a good paper,  containing with interesting ideas.\nHowever, the state-of-the-art discussion about sampling methods is formed by just one sentence. I suggest to add more references about adaptive rejection sampling and MCMC, discussing a bit more their differences, and the differences and connections with A* sampling. Also direct methods should be discussed. For this reasons, I also suggest to add references to related books as Devroye's sampling book  and other, more recent books devoted to describe independent random sampling methods.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}
