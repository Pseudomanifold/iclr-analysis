{"title": "Interesting and novel way of quantifying the quality of segmentations", "review": "This paper explores the idea of having a VAE modelling the probability distribution of the real segmentations, in order to quantify the quality of the predicted segmentation (using another network). The paper refines this idea by applying regression over two parameters. The overall idea is interesting and novel to the best of my knowledge. Experimental results look convincing.\n\nThe paper does a good job at presenting the motivation, reads well in general, and it is well written (except the paragraph Entropy Uncertainty in Sec. 4.2 which contains several typos).\n\nSome comments:\nS(F(X); \u03b8) looks good enough as an estimator. It would be good to see how it does by itself, reporting that as an ablation experiment, assessing how important it is to carry out the second step (fitting a, b).\nIn the last paragraph of Sec. 2, I am not sure what it is meant by \"Variational autoencoder(VAE) (Kingma & Welling, 2013), compared with AE, has stronger representation capability and can also serve as a generative model\". No doubt about the latter point, but not sure about the former.\nSec. 3.3 is somewhat confusing, for example: what is E in eq. 9 should be L?\n\nRevision: in light of the relevant papers brought up by AnonReviewer3 and AnonReviewer4, that have not been discussed in the paper, I modify my rating to 6.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
