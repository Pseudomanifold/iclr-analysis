{"title": "well written.", "review": "PROS:\n- The text is very well written, with a good balance between mathematical details and intuitions.\n- I really like the high-level description of the algorithms and proof techniques\n\nCONS:\nto be completely honest, I am not sure I have learnt anything new from the paper. \n1) the proof techniques are very standard\n2) although there must be some small innovations, I thought that all the results had more or less been proven by Dupuis and co-authors:\na. large deviation principles\nb. the larger the swapping rate, the better (which motivated Dupuis & al to consider the infinite swapping limit.)\n\nand\nc. Bakri & al methodology to prove convergence relying on the carre du champ is by now very standard and the proofs of the paper are only minor adaptations.\n\nI must probably be missing something, and I encourage the authors to clarify what the main novelties are when compared to the several papers by Dupuis & al. \n\nREMARKS:\n1) I do not really understand the emphasis on optimisation while all the proofs are related to the convergence to the stationary distributions.\n\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
