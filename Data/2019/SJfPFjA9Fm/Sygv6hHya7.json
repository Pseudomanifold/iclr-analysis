{"title": "well written but not weak results", "review": "The paper considers 'replica exchange' Langevin dynamics. These methods are very popular among practitioners, and developing some theory backing the empirical successes is an important goal.\nUnfortunately this paper offers only weak results. \n- The first 6 pages set up the general formalism. This is textbook material adapted to the current problem.\n- Page 7 offers a result (expression for the Dirichlet form), which is hardly more than an exercise for anybody familiar with Markov Chains theory. \n- Page 8 gives a Poincare inequality. Again, this follows from known results. More importantly: (1) It does not show any advantage of replica exchange over standard dynamics; (2) It does not provide any quantitative insight for high-dimensional problems.\n- Similar comments hold for the following pages. They are an exercise in applying standard formalism to this problem, without really showing any significative advantage of replica exchange.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
