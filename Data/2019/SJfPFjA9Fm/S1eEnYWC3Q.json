{"title": "Proof that replica exchange accelerates convergence in Langevin dynamics", "review": "This paper gives a theoretical analysis of an interesting statistical physics technique known as replica exchange. The basic idea is that Langevin dynamics at low temperature is slow to converge, and that one could potentially boost the convergence by alternating between low and high temperature. At the extreme one could imagine running in parallel a random search and a gradient descent, and ``teleporting\" the gradient descent algorithm whenever the random search algorithm finds a point with better value. This makes a lot of sense and it is nice to see a theoretical analysis of this. The mathematics are sound, but I do not know whether it is an appropriate submission for ICLR.\n\nOne comment from the math side: it would be interesting (albeit probably difficult) to study kappa in (3.10) as a function of a. In particular at face value it looks like one only benefits from taking a larger, so why not study the limiting behavior of a->infty? What is the limiting value of kappa? Can you perform those calculations in the convex case at least?", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
