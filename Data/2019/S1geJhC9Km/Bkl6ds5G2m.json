{"title": "many typos", "review": "i take reviewing very seriously, and it often takes hours per paper. this paper, however, has many typos, grammatical errors, and seems to have been submitted last minute.  therefore, i have read the paper quickly.\nthat said, i do not understand the results.\nclearly, many discretization methods have previously been described, as alluded to by citing the taxonomy paper on the subject.  the authors state they have developed a better approach.  however, i do not see a comparison to the state of the art in the simulations, and i do not follow the results of Table 2, which columns correspond to which particular algorithms? in either case, the proposed approach does not seem to improve the empirical results, nor have theoretical guarantees, so i am not particularly impressed with the results either.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}
