{"title": "Interesting but still immature solutions to a critical issues in EHRs", "review": "In the submitted manuscript, the authors introduce a novel deep learning architecture to solve the  problem of supervised learning with sparse and irregularly sampled multivariate time series, with a specific interest in EHRs. The architecture is based on the use of a semi-parametric interpolation network followed by the application of a prediction network, and it is tested on two classification/regression tasks.\n\nThe manuscript is interesting and well written: the problem is properly located into context with extensive bibliography, the method is sufficiently detailed and the experimental comparative section is rich and supportive of the authors\u2019 claim. However, there are a couple of issues that need to be discussed: \n\n\t\u25aa\tthe reported performances represent only a limited improvement over the comparing baselines, indicating that the proposed model is promising but it is still immature\n\t\u25aa\tthe model is sharing many characteristics with (referenced) published methods, which the proposed algorithm is a smart combination of - thus, overall, the novelty of the introduced method is somewhat limited.\n\n\n######### \n\nAfter considering the proposed improvements, I decided to raise my mark to 6. Thanks for the good job done!\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
