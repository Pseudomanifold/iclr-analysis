{"title": "An interesting view point on robustness.", "review": "This paper investigated the robustness of RL policies learning under different environmental conditions. \n\nBased on the observations that policies learnt in different experimental settings lead to different generalizability, the authors proposed an EXP3 based reward-guided curriculum for improving policy robustness. The algorithm was tested on inverse pendulum, cart-pole balancing, and ball-pushing in OpenAI gym.\n\nThe paper is well-organized and easy to understand. Written errors didn't influence understanding. Papers in the references were not properly cited.\n\nIt is an interesting discovery that different environment brewed different policies with different robustness/generalizability in daily life. However, these are also easily derivable in physics, especially in the three experiments tested in the paper. It would be more complete to compare with PID controllers.\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
