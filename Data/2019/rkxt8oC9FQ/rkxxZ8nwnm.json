{"title": "Overall a good paper", "review": "This paper proposes an augmentation of traditional neural network learning to allow for the inference of causal effects. Specifically, they modify the data sampling procedure of SGD during training to use matched samples that are paired via propensity score matching. Experimental results on a number of dataset show that the proposed methodology is comparable to alternative machine learning based causal inference methods. \n\nOverall, I think this is a nice idea. I have two main concerns: \n(1) The use of small batches for matching. Figure 2 does alleviate this concern to an extent, but there is a large literature in statistics and the social sciences on the effect that the quality of matches have on the final causal estimand. It is quite possible that this particular dataset is more amenable to PSM. It is also worth noting that while there is bias reduction shown in figure 2, it is not overwhelming. \n\n(2) The use of propensity scores for matching. One of the insights from the heterogeneous treatment effect literature is that it is not difficult to find cases where the propensity of treatment is identical for two sets of covariates that otherwise do not obey any real balance. This can lead to large biases in the final estimate. Given that PSM is still a relatively widely used practice, I don\u2019t think that its use is a ground for rejection in itself, but given that neural networks are often used to estimate complex causal relations when they are used and this paper is interested in individual treatment effects it is worth noting. \n\nI found the experimental setup to do a very good job in covering large portions of the behavior of the algorithm. The final results are a little underwhelming\u2013the proposed method does not appear to clearly define a new state of the art for the tasks it is applied to\u2013but it is often competitive and the paper presents an interesting idea.\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
