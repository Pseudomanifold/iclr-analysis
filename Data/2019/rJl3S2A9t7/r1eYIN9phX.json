{"title": "Sarah applied to policy optimization with comparable performance to SVRG", "review": "The paper extends Sarah to policy optimization with theoretical analysis and experimental study. \n\n1) The theoretical analysis under certain assumption seems novel. But the significance is unknown compared to similar analysis. \n\n2) The analysis demonstrates the advantage of Sarah over SVRG, as noted in Remark 1. It would be better to give explicit equations for SVRG in order for comparison.\n\n3) Experimental results seem to show empirically that the SARAH is only comparable to SVRG.\n\n4) Presentation needs to be improved.
