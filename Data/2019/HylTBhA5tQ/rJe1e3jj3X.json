{"title": "Clear and simple idea, insightful experiments.", "review": "The paper is well written and the main contribution, a methodology to find \u201cblind-spot attacks\u201d well motivated and differences to prior work stated clearly.\n\nThe empirical results presented in Figure 1 and 2 are very convincing. The gain of using a sufficiently more complicated approach to assess the overall distance between the test and training dataset is not clear, comparing it to the very insightful histograms. Why for example not using a simple score based on the histogram, or even the mean distance? Of course providing a single measure would allow to leverage that information during training. However, in its current form this seems rather complicated and computationally expensive (KL-based). As stated later in the paper the histograms themselves are not informative enough to detect such blind-spot transformation. Intuitively this makes a lot of sense given that the distance is based on the network embedding and is therefore also susceptible to this kind of data. However, it is not further discussed how the overall KL-based data similarity measure would help in this case since it seems likely that it would also exhibit the same issue.\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}
