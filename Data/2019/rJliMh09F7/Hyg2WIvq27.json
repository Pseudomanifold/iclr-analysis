{"title": "Well written paper with a simple idea for preventing mode-collapse in GANs but with insufficiently experimental validation", "review": "The paper proposes a simple way of addressing the issue of mode-collapse by adding a regularisation to force the outputs to be diverse. Specifically, a loss is added that maximises the l2 loss between the images generated, normalised by the distance between the corresponding latent codes. This method is also used to control the balance between visual quality and diversity.\n\nThe paper is overall well written, introducing and referencing well existing concepts, and respected the 8 pages recommendation.\n\nWhy was the maximum theta (the bound for numerical stability) incorporated in equation 2? What happens if this is omitted in practice? How is this determined?\n\nIn section 4, an increase of the gradient norm of the generator is implied: does this have any effect on the robustness/sensitivity of the model to adversarial attacks?\n\nIn section 5, how is the \u201cappropriate CGAN\u201d determined?\n\nMy main issue is with the experimental setting that is somewhat lacking. The visual quality of the samples illustrated in the paper is inferior to that observed in the state-of-the-art, begging the question of whether this is a tradeoff necessary to obtain better diversity or if it is a consequence of the additional regularisation.. The diversity observed seems to mainly be attributable to colour differences rather than more elaborate differences. Even quantitatively, the proposed method seems only marginally better than other methods.\n\nUpdate post rebuttal\n-----------------------------\nThe experimental setting that is a little lacking. Qualitatively and quantitatively, the improvements seem marginal, with no significant improvement shown. I would have liked a better study of the tradeoff between visual quality and diversity, if necessary at all.\n\nHowever, the authors addressed well the issues. Overall, the idea is interesting and simple and, while the paper could be improved with some more work, it would benefit the ICLR readership in its current form, so I would recommend it as a poster -- I am increasing my score to that effect.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
