{"title": "Interesting idea with good experimental validation", "review": "The paper proposes a method for generating diverse outputs for various conditional GAN frameworks including image-to-image translation, image-inpainting, and video prediction. The idea is quite simple, simply adding a regularization term so that the output images are sensitive to the input variable that controls the variation of the images. (Note that the variable is not the conditional input to the network.) The paper also shows how the regularization term is related to the gradient penalty term. The most exciting feature about the work is that it can be applied to various conditional synthesis frameworks for various tasks. The paper includes several experiments with comparison to the state-of-the-art. The achieved performance is satisfactory. \n\nTo the authors, wondering if the framework is applicable to unconditional GANs.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
