{"title": "A Good and Solid Work", "review": "This paper develops a method to accelerate the finite difference method in solving PDEs. Basically, the paper proposes a revised framework for fixed point iteration after discretization. The framework introduces a free linear operator --- the choice of the linear operator will influence the convergence rate. The paper uses a deep linear neural network to learn a good operator. Experimental results on Poisson equations show that the learned operator achieves significant speed-ups. The paper also gives theoretical analysis about the range of the valid linear operator (convex open set) and guarantees of the generalization for the learned operator. \n\nThis is, in general, a good paper. The work is solid and results promising.  Solving PDEs is no doubt an important problem, having broad applications. It will be very meaningful if we can achieve the same accuracy using much less computational power.  Here, I have a few questions. \n\n1). Why didn\u2019t you try the nonlinear deep network? Is it merely for computational efficiency? I expect that nonlinear networks might result in even better estimates of H and further reduce the number of fixed-point iterations, despite each operation of H will be more expensive. There might be some trade-off here. But I would like to see some empirical results and discussions.\n\n2). The evaluation is only on Poisson equations, which are known to be easy. Have you tried other PDEs, such as Burger\u2019s equations? I think your method will be more meaningful for those challenging PDEs, because they will require much more fine-grained grids to achieve a satisfactory accuracy and hence much more expensive. It will be great if your method can dramatically improve the efficiency for solving these equations. \n\n3). I am a bit confused about the statement of Th 3 --- the last sentence \u201cH is valid for all parameters f and b if the iterator \\psi converges \u2026\u201d I think it should be \u201cfor one parameter\u201d. \n\nMiscellaneous:\n1)\tTypo.
