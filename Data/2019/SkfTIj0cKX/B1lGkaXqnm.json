{"title": "The main idea of the paper was very interesting, but the clarity of the paper needs to be improved significantly", "review": "The paper proposed a new framework for session-based recommendation system that can optimize for sparse and delayed signal like purchase. The proposed algorithm with an innovative IRN architecture was intriguing. \n\nThe writing of the paper was not very clear and pretty hard to follow. With this level of clarity, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s easy for other people to reproduce the results in this paper, especially in section 4, where I expect more details about the description of the proposed new architecture. Even though the author has promised to release their implementation upon acceptance, I still think the paper needs a major change to make the proposed algorithm more accessible and easier for reproduce.\n\nSome examples:\nWhat is L_A3C in \u201cL = L_A3C + L_IRN\u201d in the first paragraph of session 4? It looks like a loss from a previous paper, but it\u2019s kind hard to track what it is exactly.\n\n\u201cwhere Tj,\u03c4 is the \u03c4-th imagined item, \u03c6(\u00b7) is the input encoder shared by \u03c0 (for joint feature learning), AE is the autoencoder that reconstructs the input feature, and the discounting factor \u03b3 is used to mimic Bellman type operations. \u2026 Therefore, we use the one-hot transformation as \u03c6(\u00b7) and replace AE with the policy \u03c0 (excluding the final softmax function), and only back-propagate errors of non-zero entries.\u201d\nThis seems one of the most important components of the proposed algorithm, but I found it\u2019s very hard to understanding what is done here exactly.\n\nRegardless the sketchy description of the algorithm, the empirical results look good, with comprehensive baseline methods for comparison. It\u2019s interesting to see the comparison between different reward function. Maybe the author can also discuss on the impact of the new imagination module on the training time.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}
