{"title": "This paper presents a dynamic graph embedding method, which considers two types of dynamics in evolving networks: association events with node and edge grows, and communication events with node-node interactions.     ", "review": "The paper is very well written. The proposed approach is appropriate on modeling the node representations when the two types of events happen in the dynamic networks. Authors also clearly discussed the relevance and difference to related work. Experimental results show that the presented method outperforms the other baselines.\nOverall, it is a high-quality paper. \nThere are only some minor comments for improving the paper:\n\u03bd\tPage 6, there is a typo. \u201cfor node v by employing \u2026\u201d  should be \u201cfor node u\u201d\n\u03bd\tPage 6, \u201cBoth GAT and GaAN has\u201d   should be  \u201cBoth GAT and GaAN have\u201d\n\u03bd\tIn section 5.1, it will be great if authors can explain more what are the \u201cassociation events\u201d and \u201ccommunication events\u201d with more details in these two evaluation datasets.\n", "rating": "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
