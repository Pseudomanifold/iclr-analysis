{"title": "review of local critic training of deep neural networks", "review": "This manuscript presents a new method that can conduct local training of a deep neural network. \nBriefly speaking, the proposed method first cuts a very deep network into a few groups and then train the parameters of each group almost independent of the other groups. The main idea is to attach a local critic module to each group and the error gradient is back propagated to each group from its local critic module instead of the last layer of the whole network.\nSuch an idea seems to work well and the resultant performance decrease is acceptable when the original network is not very large. However, when the original network is complex, the performance decrease may be relatively big. \n\nAnother benefit of this local critic training is that in addition to the main model, it can also produce several submodels that can be used for ensemble inference and progressive classification. \n\nIn summary, this manuscript proposes an interesting idea, but not sure empirically how useful it will be since for a complex network, this method may result in relatively big performance decrease. For a simple network, although the performance decrease is small, but there is no need to use the proposed training method for a simplex network.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
