{"title": "questionable necessity/importance of establishing explicit connections between HMMs and RNNs ", "review": "The paper studies explicit connections between HMMs and RNNs by architecturally transforming an HMM to an RNN and vice versa. This gives a spectrum of architectures between HMMs and RNNs (Figure 1). The paper also proposes to build on the tutorial paper of Eisner (2016) by establishing connections between forward probabilities under HMMs with quantities in the RNN cell.\n\nThe main problem with the work is unfortunately its direction. It's not clear why these architectural connections between two particular models are significant. The aspects of these connections (e.g., independence) are not unknown and do not seem to add significant insights (other than what components of RNNs are responsible for how much performance gain). \n\nIt's possible that this architectural analysis for its own sake is of interest to others, so I'll not put confidence on my review.
