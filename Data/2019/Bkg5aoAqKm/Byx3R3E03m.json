{"title": "Fast Binary Functional Search on Graph", "review": "This work extends the approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) algorithm to a more general setting. Instead of search with a \"separable\" similarity measure, the authors propose Optimal Binary Functional Search (OBFS), where the scoring function f() is in general non-separable. The exact construction of the Binary Function Graph wrt f() and X is computationally expensive. The specific approximate algorithm of OBFS proposed in the paper is to:\n1) First construct an L2 Delaunay graph for based on the dataset X only and;\n2) Perform greedy search with the L2 Delaunay graph.\n\nThe authors also discuss various conditions under which, the approximation method can achieve close to optimal value.\n\nSome of the concerns I have with this work:\n\n1) The authors do not demonstrate sufficient value of performing approximation in this specific fashion. For instance, in  Theorem 2, the authors start with the concavity assumption of the scoring function f(). Then it is natural to apply a gradient ascent method on the neighborhood graph. And the authors did not quantitatively or qualitatively justify their specific approach.\n\n2) Lately, numerous publications have shown that distilled models can achieve very high quality and render scoring function separable. The authors should at least compare their method against distillation and Maximum Inner Product Search based approaches.\n\nOverall, this research direction is interesting, but this specific work falls short for a publication at ICLR.\n\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
