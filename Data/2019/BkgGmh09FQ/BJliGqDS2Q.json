{"title": "No new insight is proposed. The techniques are not specifically designed for super-resolution task. The experimental results are also weak.", "review": "This paper proposed to improve the system resource efficiency for super resolution networks. \n\nFirst, I am afraid all the techniques considered in this paper have been investigated in previous works. Thus no new idea is proposed in this work. Also, it is also not clear why these improvement is particularly suitable for the task of super resolution. In my viewpoint, these techniques actually can be used to improve a variety of network architectures in both high-level and low-level vision tasks.\n\nSecond, the experimental results are also weak. As this work is aiming to address the super resolution tasks, at least visual comparisons between the proposed methods and other state-of-the-art approaches should be included in the experimental part. But unfortunately, no such qualitative results are presented in the manuscript. \n\nFinally, the presentation of the paper should also be carefully proofread and revised.\n", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
