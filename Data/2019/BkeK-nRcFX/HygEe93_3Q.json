{"title": "Does the nonlinearity coefficient measure nonlinearity?", "review": "I do not understand the denomination of nonlinearity coefficient provided in definition 1: although the quantity indeed does equal to 1 under whitened data distribution or orthogonal matrix, the conjecture that it should be close to 1 does not seem to be close at all just under any data distribution. Using a similar construction that section 6, we can rescale a whitened input data with a diagonal matrix D with components all equal to one except for a very large one \\lambda and also multiply the input weights by D^{-1} to compensate (and have a similar function). If you look at such construction for the linear case with identity initialization of A, the NLC is sqrt((\\lambda^2 + n - 1) (\\lambda^{-2} + n - 1)) / n which can grow arbitrarily large with \\lambda *for a linear model*. However, because of its low capacity, we would expect a linear model to have reasonable generalization. This seems to compromise the initial NLC being low as a necessary condition for reasonable generalization. \nConversely, it\u2019s possible to initialize arbitrarily large residual networks such that the resulting initial function is linear (by initializing the output weight of the incrementing block to 0). This initialization may also be done such that the initial NLC becomes close to 1. I would not think this wouldn\u2019t necessarily result in good generalization, which seems to agree with the experimental observation. \nNow given that this initial NLC is neither sufficient nor necessary to predict generalization, one can wonder what is correlating generalization and NLC together in the experiment section. Same remark applies to the correlation between nonlinearity and NLC. This is especially concerning since in the linear case, the NLC can vary whether we chose to whiten the data or not for example, so the other influencing factors need to be discovered. What were the architecture that resulted in small/high NLC?\nThe experiment section still contains interesting bits, such as successful training of very deep architecture that are very sensitive to input perturbations but they are not part of the main thread of the paper.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
