{"title": "Relative entropy for evaluating hierarchical clustering", "review": "This paper introduces a relative entropy metric for evaluating hierarchical clustering. The paper is not well-written and its contributions are not clear to me. The abstracts and introduction promising for a novel hierarchical clustering algorithm, but I can only understand that they are using an agglomerative algorithm with the inter-cluster similarity of Eq. 10.\nThey show that their similarity metric reduces to the previous work by setting \\pi = p or uniform. However, in the experiments, they only use these two cases, which does not support the importance of using relative entropy metric.  I guess picking the best \\pi is an important part of this approach which has been left out. \nThe authors violate the blindness of the paper by including a link to their github page, for which an anonymous repository should have been used.\nIt also worth noting that nowadays the graph representation term is often used for graph embedding, which makes the title very misleading.
