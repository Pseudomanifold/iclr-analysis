{"title": "A nice idea and model with really lacking experimental validation", "review": "Quick summary:\n\nThe author investigate if we can learn a linearized state space model using deep generative models to guide and transform non-linear dynamic observations into linear state space processes. A quick analysis of the feasibilty of the model and its relation to existing models is provided. Experimental results include a GAN and a VAE as the generative model on a few datasets.\n\nPros:\n\n  - The model is interesting and the motivation is quite clear\n  - analysis is quite nice\n  - writing is quite clear and decent\n\nCons:\n\n - Extremely lacking experimental validation - there are literally no baseline models, no numbers or any kind of quantitative analysis. The figures show samples from the model with very little explanation or discussion and it's entirely unclear what we learn from this model. Scientifically speaking, this is not up to par.\n\nBottom line - I think this is a good start for a paper about an interesting model, but I don't feel that this teaches us anything about what the model learns and how it relates in practice to other models.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
