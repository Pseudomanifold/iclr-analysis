{"title": "Writing and results should be improved", "review": "This paper solves Flappy bird by combining DQN and probabilistic programming. I think this is in general a good avenue to explore.\n\nHowever I found the paper to be poorly written. For example, notation is not properly introduced, there are many mathematical mistakes and typos in the written text and citations. This makes it very hard to understand what is actually going on.\n\nIt is also not clear what is the probabilistic program and what are we conditioning on? What is the inference algorithm? Maybe it's useful to expand more on how this ties to the \"RL as inference\" framework (see e.g. Levine, 2018). It seems like we are doing rejection sampling where the condition is \"no collision\". As a result, I'm not sure whether sampling from prior is a competitive baseline.\n\nFor the DQN experiment, the learning curve seems very noisy in a way that it's unclear whether a fair conclusion can be drawn only from one run (as it appears to be done).\n\nThe experiments also feel a bit contrived to make a strong case for probabilistic programming + DQN.", "rating": "2: Strong rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
