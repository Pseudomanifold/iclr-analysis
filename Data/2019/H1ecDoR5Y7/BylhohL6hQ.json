{"title": "assumptions need better justification", "review": "This paper shows that an ideal equilibrium point of a SGP-WGAN is stable. It makes several assumptions that, while clear why they are needed in the proof, is unjustified in practice. The authors should elaborate on these assumptions and comment on why they are reasonable. \n\nAssumptions 1 and 3 essentially say that there is a tube (both in sample space and in parameter space) around the true data generating distribution in which the discriminator cannot distinguish. This seems a strong restriction to the effect of the discriminator is weak. For example, Assumption 1 says if given a sample slightly off the data manifold, it still cannot distinguish at all. A more reasonable assumption is the ability of the discriminator decays gracefully as samples approach the data manifold.\n\nAssumption 2 is also unjustified. Its main effect seems to be to eliminate a few terms in the projected Jacobian in the proof, but its relevance and whether it is reasonable in practice is entirely unmentioned.\n\nFinally, it is unclear why this notion of ``measure valued differentiation'' is needed. First, differentiation in measure spaces is no different from differentiation in other infinite dimensional functions spaces: the usual notions of Gateaux and Frechet differentiability apply. Second, the derivatives in questions are not true ``measure-derivatives'' in the sense that the argument to the function being differentiated is not a measure, it is a finite dimensional parameter. In the end, this seems essentially a derivative of a multi-variate function.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
