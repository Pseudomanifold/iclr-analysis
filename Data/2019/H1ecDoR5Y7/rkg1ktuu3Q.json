{"title": "Implications of local stability of dynamical system to \"real world\" setting not clear", "review": "In the paper, WGAN with a squared zero centered gradient penalty term w.r.t. to a general measure is studied. Under strong assumptions, local stability of a time-continuous gradient ascent/descent dynamical system near an equilibrium point are proven for the new GP term. Experiments show comparable results to the original WGAN-GP formulation w.r.t. FID and inception score.\n\nOverall, I vote for rejecting the paper due to the following reasons:\n- The proven convergence theorem is for a time-continuous \"full-batch\" dynamical system, which is very far from what happens in practice (stochastic + time discrete optimization with momentum etc). I don't believe that one can make any conclusions about what is actually happening for GANs from such an idealized setting. Overall, I don't understand why I should care about local stability of that dynamical system.\n- Given the previous point I feel the authors draw too strong conclusions from their results. I don't think Theorem 1 gives too many insights about the success of gradient penalty terms.\n- There are only marginal improvements in practice over WGAN-GP when using other penalty measures. \n\nFurther remarks:\n- In the introduction it is claimed that mode collapse is due to JS divergence and \"low-dimensionality of the data manifold\". This is just a conjecture and the statement should be made more weak.\n\n- The preliminaries on measure theory are unnecessarily complicated (e.g. partly developed in general metric spaces). I suggest that the authors try to simplify the presentation for the considered case of R^n and avoid unnecessarily complicated (\"mathy\") definitions as they distract from the actual results. \n\n==after rebuttal==\nAfter reading the authors rebuttal I increased the my rating to 6 as they addressed some of my doubts. I still think that the studied setting is too idealized, but it is a first step towards an analysis.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
