{"title": "unclear, critically ill-written paper", "review": "Presentation of the work is critically weak and I failed to understand the objective and contributions of the paper (despite a solid knowledge in Bayesian inference). They are many editing problems and the English is problematic, but most importantly the writing fails to properly introduce the problem, the objective and solutions.", "rating": "2: Strong rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
