{"title": "Interesting idea but better evaluation needed", "review": "This paper presents an adversarial learning model for generating diverse responses for dialogue systems based on HRED (hierarchical recurrent encoder-decoder) network. The contribution of the work mainly lies in: 1. adversarial learning, and 2. injecting Gaussian noise at word-level and sentence-level to encourage the diversity. Overall, the idea is interesting, and the automatic evaluation based on perplexity, BLEU, ROUGE, etc shows that the proposed methods outperform existing methods.\n\nSeveral suggestions:\n- It seems like injection noise at word-level almost always outperforms adding sentence-level noise. It would be better if the authors can explain why this happens and whether it can be applied for other response generation tasks.\n\n- Built on above comment, the authors can also experiment with other response generation datasets, e.g. interactions on social media.\n\n- From examples in Table 3 and 4, the generated responses are of low quality overall. I suggest the authors run human evaluation to see whether there is any significant difference among system responses by different models on aspects of informativeness and fluency at least.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
