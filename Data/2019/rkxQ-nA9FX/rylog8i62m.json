{"title": "A good paper", "review": "The paper is well written and easy to follow. The topic is apt.\n\nI don\u2019t have any comments except the following ones.\n\nLemma 2.4, Point 1: The proof is confusing. Consider the one variable vector case. Assuming that there is only one variable w, then \\nabla L(w) is not perpendicular to w in general. The Rayleigh quotient example L(w)  = w\u2019*A*w/ (w\u2019*w) for a symmetric matrix A, then \\nabla L(w) = (2/w\u2019*w)(Aw - L(w)*w), which is not perpendicular to w. \nEven if we constrain ||w ||_2 = 1, then also  \\nabla L(w)  is not perpendicular to w.\nAm I missing something?\n\nWhat is G_t in Theorem 2.5. It should be defined in the theorem itself. There is another symbol G_g which is a constant.\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}
