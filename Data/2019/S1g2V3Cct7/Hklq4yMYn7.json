{"title": "Reduction in Catastrophic Forgetting by Augmented Experience Replay", "review": "The authors propose an approach to augment experience replay buffers with properties that can alleviate issues with catastrophic forgetting. The buffers are augmented by storing both new and historical experiences, along with the desired historical policy & value distribution. The AC learning now couples two additional losses that ensures the new policy does not drift away from old actor distribution (via KL) and new value does not drift away from old critic distribution (via L2 loss).\n\nThe authors provided clear experimental evidence that shows how an RL agent that does not use CLEAR will observe catastrophic when we sequentially train different tasks (and it is not due to destructive interference using the simultaneous and separate training/evaluation experiments). Author also showed how different replay make ups can change the result of CLEAR (and it's a matter of empirical tuning).\n\nThe formulation of CLEAR also is simple while delivering interesting results. It would have been nice to see how this is used in a practical setting as all these are synthetic environments / tasks. The discussion on relationship with biological mechanism also seems unnecessary as it's unclear whether the mechanism proposed is actually what's in the CLS.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
