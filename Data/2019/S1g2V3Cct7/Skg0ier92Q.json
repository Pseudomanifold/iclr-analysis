{"title": "Solid Paper, but Novelty over Experience Replay Needs Better Motivation", "review": "This paper proposes a particular variant of experience replay with behavior cloning as a method for continual learning. The approach achieves good performance while not requiring a task label. This paper makes the point that I definitely agree with that all of the approaches being considered should compare to experience replay and that in reality many of them rarely do better. However, I am not totally convinced when it comes to the value of the actual novel aspects of this paper. \n\nMuch of the empirical analysis of experience replay (i.e. the buffer size, the ratio of past and novel experiences, etc\u2026) was not surprising or particular novel in my eyes. The idea of using behavior cloning is motivated fully through the lens of catastrophic forgetting and promoting stability and does not at all address achieving plasticity. This was interesting to me as the authors do mention the stability-plasticity dilemma, but a more theoretical analysis of why behavior cloning is somehow the right method among various choices to promote stability while not sacrificing or improving plasticity was definitely missing for me. Other options can certainly be considered as well if your aim is just to add stability to experience replay such a notion of weight importance for the past like in EwC (Kirkpatric et al., 2017) and many other papers or using knowledge distillation like LwF (Li and Hoeim, 2016). LwF in particular seems quite related. I wonder how LwF + experience replay compares to the approach proposed here. In general the discourse could become a lot strong in my eyes if it really considered various alternatives and explained why behavior cloning provides theoretical value. \n\nOverall, behavior cloning seems to help a little bit based on the experiments provided, but this finding is very likely indicative of the particular problem setting and seemingly not really a game changer. In the paper, they explore settings with fairly prolonged periods of training in each RL domain one at a time. If the problem was to become more non-stationary with more frequent switching (i.e. more in line with the motivation of lifelong learning), I would imagine that increasing stability is not necessarily a good thing and may slow down future learning. \n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
