{"title": "review", "review": "The paper proposes a novel trial to alleviate the catastrophic forgetting for continual learning which is kind a mixture model of on and off-policy. The core concept of the method is utilizing experience replay buffer for all past events with new experience. They mainly worked on their method in the setting of reinforcement learning. In the experiments, they show that the model successfully mitigate the catastrophic forgetting with this behavioral cloning, and has the performance comparable to recent continual learning approaches.\n\nThe paper is easy to follow, and the methodology is quite intuitive and straight forward. In this paper, I have several questions.\n\nQ1. I wonder the reason that every tasks are trained cyclically in sequence. And is there any trial to learn each task just once and observe the catastrophic forgetting of them when they have to detain the learned knowledge in a long time without training them again, as does most of visual domain experiments of the other continual learning research.\n\nQ2. In figure 5, I wonder why the natlab_varying_map_ramdomize(probe task) can perform well even they didn\u2019t learn yet. The score of brown line increases nearly 60~70% of final score(after trained) during training the first task. Because the tasks are deeply correlated? or it is just common property of probe task?\n\nQ3. Using reservoir(buffer) to prevent catastrophic forgetting is natural and reasonable. Is there some of quantitative comparison in the sense of memory requirement and runtime? I feel that 5 or 50 million experiences at each task are huge enough to memorize and manage.\n\nAdditionally, in the experiment of figure 5, I think it could be much clear with a verification that the probe task  is semantically independent (no interference) over all the other tasks. \n\nAlso, it is quite hard to compare the performance of the models just with plots. I expect that it could be much better to show some of quantitative  results(as number).", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
