{"title": "This paper would not be best fit to ICLR.", "review": "This paper focuses on the extraction of the (multi) periodicities from a signal. The paper describes the conventional method based on the Fourier transformation and/or autocorrelation methods, and proposed method, which first detects a distribution of spectral leakages, and prune the periodicity hints by using a clustering algorithm. The proposed method is also extended to deal with multi-periodicities. The effectiveness of the proposed method is shown with the controlled simulation data and several real data. This paper is well written (note it is over 8 pages though), but it is not learning-based approach, and would not best fit to major ICLR interests.\n\nComments:\n- The abstract needs to be more self-consistent without referring the citation for a brief explanation. Also it should have more detailed experimental discussions.\n- Algorithm 1 needs some refinement (too code-like, although it is understandable). For example, several methods (nextBinValue and append) would be better to be replaced with other (human readable) expressions.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}
