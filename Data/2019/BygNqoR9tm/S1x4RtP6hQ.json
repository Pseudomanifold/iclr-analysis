{"title": "Contributions should be better explained", "review": "Summary\n\nThis paper builds upon the recent Wasserstein Auto-Encoders; the main innovation is the use of the Sinkhorn distance between the prior and the aggregate posterior. This distance, is used as a differentiable and more tractable surrogate for the wasserstein distance, which is proposed as an alternative to heuristics (e.g. MMD) in Wasserstein-auto encoders.\n\nAlso, the authors provide some theoretical results complementing the Wasserstein Auto-Encoders papers and illustrate their results showing better or equal performance than with alternatives, particularly VAE and WAE.\n\nEvaluation.\nIt is certainly a good paper, and well written (but notice several typos). The experimental part is thorough which certainly plays in favor at evaluation time. Theoretical results are a significant contribution, but not quite deep.\n\n But what troubles me is that when I read the paper it was hard for me to understand what the contribution is. My guess on this is what I wrote in the Summary. And if that is the case, I think it is a rather marginal contribution: it would be desired to have a theory for why using the wassertein penalization is better than the ones proposed in the WAE paper (Recall, there, penalizations are introduced to get rid of a constraint that appears in the minimization paper). The authors argue that Sinkhorn does as good as wasserstein and I can believe that (but it would be good if authors could refer to recent results [1] regarding the quality of this approximation, which essentially say that sinkhorn does no do miracles) but the most fundamental question is why a wasserstein penalization is better than the ones proposed in WAE. If no such theory is available, it is hard for me to judge the paper as non-marginal.\n\nTheorem 3.1 is an attempt for such an explanation, but it was not clear at all for me why theorem 3.1 implies that wasserstein distance is the penalization to use. Theorem 3.1 only gives an upper bound. The authors may elaborate on this\n\n\nI hope my criticism is helpful for improving the current version of the manuscript.\n\n\n[1] http://proceedings.mlr.press/v75/weed18a/weed18a.pdf\n\n\n=== after rebuttal ===\n\nThe authors have addressed my concerns and I have updated my score accordingly.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
