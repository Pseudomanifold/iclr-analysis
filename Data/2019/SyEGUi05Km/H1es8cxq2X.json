{"title": "Novel method and good results", "review": "I have not worked in the material science field and I am not familiar with the crystallographic structures, nor the GAN. Below is my best try. \n\nThis work proposed a GAN based method to generate crystallographic structures with 3 chemical elements from samples with two chemical elements. What I liked the most about this paper is that they work closely with the material science researcher to define the problem, the experiments and analyzing the results. I believe this is the very important for application papers comparing to just inventing ideas.\n\nThe paper is very well structured and clearly written. The code will be published online after the reviewing phase. Some detailed comments following:\n\n1. To demonstrate the general applicability of the method, could you give more examples with increasing complexity that can use your method?\n2. The author write the aim for e.q. (5) is \u201cto control the original observations are reconstructed as accurate as possible\u201d. Isn\u2019t this already defined in the reconstruction loss? Could you elaborate more on this?\n3. In the experiments, you compared your method with a classical Gan. Is it possible to incorporate the distance constraints e.q. (12) into the classical GAN? Will this be a more fair comparison?\n4. In the Section 4.3, the author mentioned verifying the composition needs DFT, which is computationally expensive. How about just verifying the successful ones generated by CrystalGAN with constraints?\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}
