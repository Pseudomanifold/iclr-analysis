{"title": "An application paper with no novelty and probably not suitable for the venue", "review": "The authors compare a collection of machine learning models to predict the expected rental income from an investment property. The dataset they use to train their model is fairly small (around 4K transactions). In addition to using house specific features the authors use other macro features, such as, walk score etc. Using this the authors compare a set of machine learning models and report their findings. \n\nWhile the work presented in the paper is informative, I feel there are a number of issues with the paper, making it unsuitable for publication in ICLR. Some of them include: \n- There is no new novel model or technique proposed in the paper. It is essentially a collection of experiments run on some dataset with reported findings. \n- The dataset used is really small. Making the generalizability of the results somewhat questionable. \n- Lastly, even though there is nothing technically wrong with the presented work, I feel that ICLR is not the best venue for such works. Perhaps a data science conference, such as, KDD/WSDM might be much better suited.", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
