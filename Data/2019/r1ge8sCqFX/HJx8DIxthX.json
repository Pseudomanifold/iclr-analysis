{"title": "Empirical investigation with flaws and no novelty.", "review": "The paper investigates different machine learning approaches to model and\npredict the return on property investments, in particular with respect to eager\nand lazy learning techniques. The authors evaluate those different techniques on\na dataset of properties in Virginia. They conclude that lazy techniques provide\nbetter performance than eager ones.\n\nThe paper is a purely empirical study that does not introduce any novel\nmachine learning or evaluation techniques. The authors use the off-the-shelf\nWEKA toolbox. The results are not clear, given that only a single data set was\nused to evaluate the different approaches, and general recommendations cannot be\nmade.\n\nThe paper is not well written and the descriptions do not convey what the\nauthors have done very well. An example of this is Figure 3, which purports to\nshow the average rent (or rent distribution?) for different housing types. There\nare multiple categories in there that are not valid housing types (\"Make Me\nMove\") and the rents shown are incorrect (e.g. more than a million for a town\nhouse). It is also unclear why the average rent for a single family house is\napproximately 4 times as much as for a town house.\n\nThe problems with Figure 3 are exemplary of the paper; the other issues are too\nnumerous to list.\n\nIn summary, this paper should be rejected.", "rating": "2: Strong rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
