{"title": "Concerns about methodological contributions", "review": "Quality: your paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of a number of methods. However, I am not convinced by the choice of methods or the need for them to be compared as such.\n\nClarity: the paper is unclear in a number of places.\n\nOriginality: as far as I am aware, the paper is novel.\n\nSignificance: As stated above, I do not believe you have made the case that we need a comparison of these methods on this dataset.\n\nMore detailed comments:\n\n1. The distinction between lazy and eager learning is not one that I find particularly helpful. Perhaps this is my own ignorance. I checked two standard ML textbooks (Bishop, Murphy) and neither mentions this distinction. As the crux of your paper is a comparison between these methods, you need to be very upfront about why this dichotomy is a useful one. And as your paper is very application-oriented, the justification needs to be related to that application.\n\n2. Your data is, fundamentally, spatial (actually spatiotemporal). Thus it would be appropriate to consider models that specifically account for spatial structure, e.g.  Gaussian processes.\n\n3. Do you have a novel methodological or theoretical contribution? A comparison of methods on an important dataset is no doubt useful, but I don't think ICLR is the right venue.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
