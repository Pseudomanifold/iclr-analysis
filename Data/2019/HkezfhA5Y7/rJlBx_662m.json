{"title": "see below", "review": "The paper discusses on a rate distortion interpretation of adversarial examples by building the equivalence of DNN and a noisy channel. The proposed topic is very interesting. However, it is quite disappointing after reading the paper, that it does not deliver. In a sense, the reader has an impression that the paper is a collection of fractions of small thoughts and empirical observation pieces that are yet to be stringed up coherently.\n*To start with, the contributions are not clear. The major equations (1-4) are all pre-existing. The main Figure (fig.1) is also not new. Sec.3 is on implications, while it is more a discussion section centered on existing works about capacity and adversarial examples. Although it is claimed in the beginning of the paper 3 theoretical and empirical contributions, they are not clearly presented in the follow-up text.\n*Empirical evaluation, in Fig.2, a legend should be in place to introduce the colored curves. Currently it is unclear what it is for each of the curves. \n*Fig.3: it is unclear why the MI plots are of piecewise straight lines. Does it imply that the two MIs are linearly related?\n*Table 1&2: Not clear how this observation has to do with the RD theory.\n\nSeems no response from the authors.
