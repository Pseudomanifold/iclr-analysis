{"title": "Modification to GAN construction which induces bias to encourage mode matching between latent and data space.", "review": "This paper presents a GAN construction which encourages the latent space to mode-match the data distribution.  This allows for unsupervised class-label inference (experimentally verified for two tasks).\n\nI think the paper is of low significance, but the approach outlined is interesting.\n\nUnfortunately, I think the work is slightly let down by the presentation (there are many typos, and the first couple of sections could do with a rewrite), as well as a lack of rigorous experimentation.  I believe that the paper is also missing references to the conditional VAE literature, which shares many similarities (at least in application) with the described approach.\n\nPros:\n- Some theoretical justification for the approach taken.\n- Early evidence that the method allows for latent space class separation, given a prior on number of classes.\n\nCons:\n- A little more experimental evidence would be welcome.  E.g. why is the result for CIFAR 10 not shown---hard to understand how helpful the inductive bias is for a general problem.\n- No discussion of conditional VAEs (which were designed with a very similar goal in mind).\n- No discussion of why decomposing h in the manner in which they did was appropriate.\n- Would be nice to see a more detailed study of how adding supervision + varying the strength of the inductive bias affects performance.\n\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
