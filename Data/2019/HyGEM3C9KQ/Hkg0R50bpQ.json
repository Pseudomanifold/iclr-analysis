{"title": "Solid improvements to DNC.", "review": "Summary:\n\nThis paper is built on the top of DNC model. Authors observe a list of issues with the DNC model: issues with deallocation scheme, issues with the blurring of forward and backward addressing, and issues in content-based addressing. Authors propose changes in the network architecture to solve all these three issues. With toy experiments, authors demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed modifications to DNC. The improvements are also seen in more realistic bAbI tasks.\n\nMajor Comments:\n\nThe paper is well written and easy to follow. The proposed improvements seem to result in very clear improvements. The proposed improvements also improve the convergence of the model. I do not have any major concerns about the paper. I think that contributions of the paper are good enough to accept the paper.\n\nI also appreciate that the authors have submitted the code to reproduce the results.\n\nI am curious to know if authors observe similar convergence gains in bAbI tasks as well. Can you please provide the mean learning curve for bAbI task for DNC vs proposed modifications?\n", "rating": "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
