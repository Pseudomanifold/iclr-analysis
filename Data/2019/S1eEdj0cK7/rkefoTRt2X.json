{"title": "Sorry I don't fully appreciate the motivation", "review": "This paper empirically evaluates whether NMT can predict word alignment. This is done by measuring the alignment error rate between silver-data generated from FastAlign and various methods to extract alignment from NMT. The conclusions are that NMT attention does not predict alignment well, and the proposed method of training an additional alignment extraction model performs better. \n\nUnfortunately, I do not appreciate the motivation of the work. Attention is not alignment. Yes, we can try to extract alignment from attention or other parts of the model. But we should really not expect attention to do alignment, because it was simply not designed to do so. \n\nSo I am not surprised by the first result that AER for attention-based alignment is bad. I am also not suprised by the second result where training an explicit word alignment model (Eq 6) gets better AER, because that is what the model is designed for. \n\nI do understand that probing alignments might increase our ability to understand and interpret these NMT models. I also thought the CFS and CFT analysis was interesting. But unfortunately I don't think the overall problem attacked by this paper is sufficiently well-motivated for a full paper at ICLR. I do think this will be suitable at, for example, a workshop on visualizing/interpreting neural networks in applications. \n\nAdditional note: Please be more specific whether the AER results in Sec 4.2-4.4 are based on scoring on gold alignments in the NIST2015 data, or silver alignments from FastAlign. The former is fine, but the latter might make the results biased for the explicit alignment model trained on the same alignments.
