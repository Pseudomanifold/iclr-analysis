{"title": "interesting idea, but quite confused on implementation and not convinced on experiments", "review": "This paper proposed a LBPNet for character recognition, which introduces the LBP feature extraction into deep learning. Personally I think that this idea is interesting for improving the efficiency of CNNs, as traditionally LBP has been demonstrated its good performance and efficiency in some vision tasks such as face recognition or pedestrian detection. However, I do have the following concerns about the paper:\n\n1. Calculation/Implementation of Eq. 4: I do not quite understand how it derived, and how to use Eq. 3 in calculation. I suggest the authors to explain more details, as this is the key for implementation of LBP layers.\n\n2. Effects of several factors on performance in the experiments are missing: (1) random projection map in Fig. 5, (2) $k$ in Eq. 2, and (3) the order of images for computing RHS of Eq. 3. In order to better demonstrate LBPNet, I suggest to add such experiments, plus training/testing behavior comparison of different networks. \n\n3. Does this network work with more much deeper?\n\n4. Data: The datasets used in the experiments are all well-aligned. This makes me feel that the RHS of Eq. 3 does make sense, because it will capture the spatial difference among data, like temporal difference in videos. How will the network behave on the dataset that is not aligned well, like affnist dataset?\n\n5. How will this network behave for the applications such as face recognition or pedestrian detection where traditionally LBP is applied?\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
