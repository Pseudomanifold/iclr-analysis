{"title": "Evolutionary part is not clear", "review": "The paper introduces Sample-Ensemble Genetic Evolutionary Network, which adopts a genetic-evolutionary learning strategy to build a group of unit models. Explanation on the evolutionary network part is not enough. For example, there is no clear explanation on how chromosomes are defined. Also, detailed analysis on computational aspect is needed.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}
