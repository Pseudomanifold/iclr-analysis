{"title": "Interesting application, limited algorithmic contribution", "review": "This paper applies GANs for unsupervised audio generation. Particularly, DCGAN-like models are applied for generating audio. This application is interesting, but the algorithmic contribution is limited.\n \nQualitative ratings are poor. The important problem of generating variable-length audio is untouched.\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
