{"title": "A unified way to incorporate high-order proximity information for graph embedding", "review": "The paper proposes a formulation for taking care of neighborhood of different distances for graph embedding. It makes use of a notion called permutation invariant function which defined as a function where if we swap any features in the inputs, the function value remains the same. Given this, they make two contributions to make the consideration of neighborhood of different distances for graph embedding possible. First, they make the assumption that the contribution of neighbours of same steps should be the same and thus permutable in defining how the embedding function of a node is depending on this neighbours. Another one is the use of 1-d NN for estimating the contribution from 1-step, 2-step and up to infinite-step. Then, the overall problem formulation is defined and can be learned using SDG.\n\n+ve:\n1. The paper is well organized and clearly presented.\n2. The technique proposed can handle neighborhood of different distances while the existing methods make explicit or implicit assumptions (and thus restrictions) about the neighborhood to be considered.\n3. The proposed method performs consistently better than a number of representative deep graph models based on a number of benchmark datasets.\n4. The method is applicable to both homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs.\n\n-ve:\n1. The part after Eq.(4) and before Section 3.3 is important but a bit hard to read as compared to the other parts of the paper.\n2. The graphs tested are not particular large. Larger ones should be tested.\n3. The methods being compared are not the most recent ones (all published in 2016 or before).\n4. Something wrong with Table 1?\n\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
