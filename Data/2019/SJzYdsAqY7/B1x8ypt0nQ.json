{"title": "spatial-Winograd pruning", "review": "In this paper, the authors propose a spatial-Winograd pruning framework, consisting of spatial structured pruning and Winograd direct pruning.  First, spatial structured pruning allows the pruned weight in the spatial domain to be kept in the Winograd domain. Then, Winograd direct pruning can further improve the sparsity in the Winograd domain. The organization of paper is OK.  The main concern is about the practical part. In the experiment, the advantage of propose framework is marginal, compared to the relevant approaches.  More comparisons with the state-of-the-art approaches should be investigated, such as light-weight design (MobileNet, ShuffleNet).
