{"title": "Very interesting idea with insufficient experimental validation", "review": "The paper proposes a framework for learning interpretable latent representations for GANs. The key idea is to use siamese networks with contrastive loss. Specifically, it decomposes the latent code to a set of knobs (sub part of the latent code). Each time it renders different images with different configurations of the knobs. For example, 1) as changing one knob while keeping the others, it expects it would only result in change of one attribute in the image, and 2) as keeping one knob while changing all the others, it expects it would result in large change of image appearances. The relative magnitude of change for 1) and 2) justifies the use of a Siamese network in addition to the image discriminator in the standard GAN framework. The paper further talks about how to use inductive bias to design the Siamese network so that it can control the semantic meaning of a particular knob. \n\nWhile I do like the idea, I think the paper is still in the early stage. First of all, the paper does not include any numerical evaluation. It only shows a couple of examples. It is unclear how well the proposed method works in general. In addition, the InfoGAN work is designed  for the same functionality. The paper should compare the proposed work to the InfoGAN work both quantitatively and qualitatively to justify its novelty.
