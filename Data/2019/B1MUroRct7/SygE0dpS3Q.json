{"title": "Algorithm directly motivated by online PCA", "review": "Sliced Inverse Regression is a well-known technique for finding EDR space in supervised dimension reduction problems, under condition that input X is normally disributed. When the number of dimensions is large and an access to observations is online, finding eigenvalues of covariance matrices (online) could become computationally costly. So, the paper focuses the problem of updating few principal components of covariance matrices as new examples come.\n\nThe key idea is that in classical SIR two problems are solved sequentially (estimation of Sigma = cov(X) and finding PCA of vectors Sigma^{-0.5}X_s where s corresponds to average X of s-th slice). The second part can be reduced to an online version of PCA (Peter M Hall et al.). \n\nThe paper seems consistent and experiments convince that the proposed method works. The lack of theoretical analysis is a disadvantage.\n\nAlso, some typos:\n1. \u0393b = \u03bb\u03a3b\u03b2 (p.4 par.3) --- beta omitted\n2. We can regard z0 = \u03a3^{-1/2}m'_k (p.4) --- bar over m omitted\n3. Formula 10 looks weird (Sigma instead of Sigma prime)\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
