{"title": "Review of \"Pixel Chem: A Representation for Predicting Material Properties with Neural Network\"", "review": "This paper suggests a new architecture for representing and predicting properties of molecules (\"Pixel Chem\"). The authors report that this architecture produces better results than previous methods on one of the QM9 dataset properties (U0) but performs worse than many of the other reported methods on other quantities. \n\nOverall, this paper is extremely unclear, contains typos in most sentences, and provides insufficient justification for the both a) the design choices made and b) the claims made wrt the performance of the model. Additionally, at least one critical baseline [1] is missing which outperforms the proposed model. In order to improve this paper, I would suggest the authors do the following: \n\n1) Heavily edit and rewrite the paper focusing on clarity of communication.\n2) Provide justifications for why design choices were made. For example, the authors state that they include a charge and energy matrix to \"mix all the things up.\" Why does it make sense to combine these factors in this way? \n3) Provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the model, showing improved performance across more than one target and including appropriate baselines, including [1]. \n\n[1] Gilmer, Justin, et al. \"Neural message passing for quantum chemistry.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1704.01212 (2017).", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
