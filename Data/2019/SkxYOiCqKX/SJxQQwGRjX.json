{"title": "Poorly motivated representation with unsubstantiated claims", "review": "This paper proposes a neural network architecture PCnet for the prediction of intensive and extensive chemical properties of molecules and materials. The authors claim that the use of prior chemical knowledge such as Mulliken electronegativity, bond strength and orbital information improves prediction accuracy. While the idea of incorporating chemical domain knowledge in the interactions of an atomistic neural network is interesting in principle, this paper has severe issues ranging from presentation over the proposed approach to the results.\n\nFirst and foremost, I would like to point out that the results in Table 1 are cherry-picked since the authors fail to cite neural network architectures that outperform their approach, e.g. for U0: 0.45 kcal/mol [MPNN, Gilmer et al 2017, ICML], 0.31 kcal/mol [SchNet, Sch\u00fctt et al, NIPS 30, 2017], 0.26 kcal/mol [HIP-NN, Lubbers et al., JCP 148, 2018]. This is especially apparent since Figure 4 is obviously inspired by Fig. 1 in [SchNet, Sch\u00fctt et al, JCP 148, 2018]. \n\nThe authors use a variety of heuristics and approximations such as a \"charge transfer ability\", bond strength, exponential decay of distances and overlaps of atomic orbitals which are multiplied \"to mix all things up\", to arrive at the PixelChem representation which is then fed into an atomistic neural network (PCnet). Combining these chemical features in such a way is neither well-motivated, nor does it lead to an improvement in accuracy compared to state-of-the-art networks.\nEven for the intensive properties (gap, HOMO, LUMO), where PCnet is supposed to have an advantage due to its use of orbital information, MPNN, SchNet and even GC and GG-NN in Table 1 outperform the proposed approach. Parameterization of the chemical features and training the PCnet end-to-end might have improved results and seems like a missed opportunity.\n\nFurther issues:\n- The manuscript is riddled with typos, grammatical errors as well as confusing sentences.\n- The authors claim that PCnet is applicable to periodic structures, however, this is never demonstrated. Beyond that their definition of periodic PixelChem does only include adjacent cells, while for a unique representation more cells might be required.\n- The \"benefits\" listed in Section 2.3 compare selectively to previous work. E.g., invariances, uniqueness, asymmetric interactions are also fullfiled by the neural networks listed above. A comparison of the PixelChem representation to the Coulomb matrix is not sufficient here.\n- The PCnet architecture uses PReLU nonlinearities. While this is fine for equilibrium predictions, for other configurations this prohibits the prediction of a smooth PES.\n\nOverall, I believe that it is important to incorporate chemical knowledge into neural networks. However, neither the approach nor the results convince me that this has been achieved here.", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
