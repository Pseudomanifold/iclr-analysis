{"title": "Nice extension of AmbientGAN with detail experiment analysis", "review": "This paper proposed a new network structure to learn GAN with incomplete data, and it is a nice extension of AmbientGAN. Two theorems are provided for better understanding the potential effect of the missing values. Improved results compared with state-of-the-art methods on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CelebA are presented. Overall, the paper is well organized, and the experiment results are sufficient to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method. I particular like figure5 where AmbientGAN failed in this case.\n\n Several suggestions about improving the paper. I notice the images used in the experiments are small size. It would be interesting to test the performance on a larger image. Another direction would be testing the robustness of the model, for example, what will happen if the observation is also noisy? Some discussion about the potential extensions will also be helpful. For example, can the proposed network be used to solve the compressive sensing problem with a real value mask instead of binary valued. \n\nI did not dive into the detail of the prove of theorems. And it seems valid by reading through each step.  Although these two theorems are not directly related to the properties of the proposed network structure. But it does provide some nice intuition.\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
