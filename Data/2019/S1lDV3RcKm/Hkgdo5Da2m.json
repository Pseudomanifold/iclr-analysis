{"title": "Resolving a major challenge in AmbientGAN, by focusing on a very specific application. ", "review": "Building upon the success of AmbientGAN by Bora, Price, and Dimakis, this paper studies one of the major issues that is not resolved in AmbientGAN: the distribution of the data corruption is typically unknown. In general this is an ill-defined problem to solve, as the data corruption distribution is not identifiable from the corrupted data. The major insight of this paper is to identify a plausible setting where such identifiability issues are not present. Namely, the corruption itself is identifiable from the corrupted data. The brilliance of this paper is in identifying this niche application of data imputation/missing data/incomplete data. \n\nOnce the goal is set to train a GAN on incomplete data, the solution somewhat follows in a straightforward manner from AmbientGAN. Pass the generated output through a masking operator, which is also trained. Train the masking operator on the masking pattern of the real (corrupted) data. Imputation generator and discriminator also follows in a straightforward manner. \n\nA major shortcoming of this paper is that the performance of the proposed approach is not fully supported by extensive experiments. For example, a major application of such imputation solution will be predicting missing data in real world applications, such as recommendation systems, or biological experimental data. A experimental setting in \"GAIN: Missing Data Imputation using Generative Adversarial Nets\" provides an excellent benchmark dataset, and imputation approaches should be compared against GAIN in those scenarios. \n\n\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
