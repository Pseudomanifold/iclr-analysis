", "review": "The paper focuses on the generalization performance of RNNs and its variant in a theoretical perspective. Compared to the previous result (Zhang et al., 2018) for RNNs, this paper refines the generalization bounds for vanilla RNNs in all cases and fills the blank for RNN variants like MGU and LSTM. Specifically, in the work of Zhang et al. (2018), the complexity term quadratically depends on the layer (or say, current sequence length, denoted by t in original paper), making it less instructive. This paper improves it to at most linear dependence and can achieve at logarithmic dependence in some cases, which should be accredited. \n\nThe key step in the proof is Lemma 2. In Lemma 2, the spectral norms of weight matrices and the number of weight parameters are decoupled. With Lemma 2, it is natural to construct a epsilon-net for RNNs and then upper bound the empirical Rademacher complexity by Dudley\u2019s entropy integral, since such methodology is not so novel. Bartlett, et al. (2017) developed this technique to analyze the generalization bound for neural networks in a margin-based multiclass classification. However, it seems a little unexplainable to apply a technique developed from classification to analyze RNNs, since the main task of RNNs never should be classification. I wonder the motivation of analyzing generalization of RNNs by the techniques established by Bartlett. \n\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
