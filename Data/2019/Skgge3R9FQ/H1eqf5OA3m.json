{"title": "The work can be improved", "review": "The idea of having a separate class for out-distribution is a very interesting idea but unfortunately previously explored. In fact, in machine learning and NLP there is the OOV class which sometimes people in computer vision also use. Some of the claims in the paper can be further substantiated or explored. For example in abstract there is a simple claim that is presented too strong: We also demonstrate that training such an augmented CNN with representative out-distribution natural datasets and some interpolated samples allows it to better handle a wide range of unseen out-distribution samples and black-box adversarial examples without training it on any adversaries. This claim is bigger than just CNNs and needs to be studied in a theoretical framework not an empirical one. Also, one simple way to stop these adversarial cases would be to explore using Sigmoid as opposed to softmax. In general it is very unlikely that you will be able to choose every variation of out-distribution cases. Much easier if you just try to solve the problem using a set of n Sigmoids (n total number of classes) and consider each output a probability distribution. \n\nHowever, the studies in this paper are still valuable and I strongly recommend continuing on the same direction.
