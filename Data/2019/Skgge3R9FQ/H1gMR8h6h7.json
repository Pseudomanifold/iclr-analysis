{"title": "Too many hidden assumptions", "review": "The paper propose to incorporate an additional class for adversarial and out-distribution samples in CNNs. The paper propose to incorporate natural out-distribution images and interpolated images to the additional class, but the problem of selecting the out-distribution images is itself an important problem. The paper presents a very simple approaches for selecting the out-distribution images that relies on many hidden assumptions on the images source or the base classier, and the interpolation mechanism is also too simple and there is the implicit assumption of low complexity images. There exists more principled approaches for selecting out-distribution images that has not considered here like those based on uncertainty estimation or recently proposed direct out-distribution detectors.\nIn summary, the quality of the paper is poor and the originality of the work is low. The paper is easily readable.", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
