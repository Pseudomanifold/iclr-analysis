{"title": "Interesting research direction but not good enough", "review": "This paper proposed to add an additional label for detecting OOD samples and adversarial examples in CNN models. This research direction seems interesting, however, the idea of using an extra label for OODs is not new and was previously explored in different domains. I would expect the describe how their method is different, and keep the research from that point.\nAdditionally, there are several claims in this paper which I'm not convinced are true, such as the over-generalization of CNNs, the choice of OODs (recent studies have shown NNs are not well calibrated, so using softmax as the confidence might not be the best idea), etc.\nReg. the results, did the authors compare their method to existing adv. example detection methods, such as Ma, Xingjun, et al. ICLR (2018) \"Characterizing adversarial subspaces using local intrinsic dimensionality.\" ? or some other method? \nMoreover, in Table 2. I'm not sure what should I conclude from the \"Naive Model Error\" on OOD samples.\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
