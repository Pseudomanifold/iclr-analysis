{"title": "Not clear what's the contribution.", "review": "The authors propose a task of classifying objects from tactile signals. To do this, the image and haptic data are collected for each object. Then, image-to-haptic and haptic-to-label predictors are trained by supervised learning. In the experiment, prediction accuracy on unseen object class is studied. \n\nThe paper is clearly written although it contains several typos. The proposed task of cross-modal inference is an interesting task. I however hardly find any significance of the proposed method. The proposed method is simple non-end-to-end predictors trained by supervised learning. So, the proposed model seems more like a naive baseline. It is not clear what scientific challenge the paper is solving and what is the contribution. Also, the performance seems not impressive. I\u2019m not sure why the authors average the haptic features. Lots of information will be lost during the averaging, why not RNNs. Overall, the paper seems to require a significant improvement.\n", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
