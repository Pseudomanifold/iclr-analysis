{"title": "Re: particle smoothing for neural Hawkes Processes", "review": "The paper presents an inference method (implicit distribution particle smoothing) for neural Hawkes processes that accounts for latent sequences of events that influence the observed trajectories.\n\nQuality\n+ The paper combines ideas from multiple areas of machine learning to tackle a challenging task of inference in multivariate continuous-time settings.\n- The figures reported from the paper are comparative graphs with respect to particle filtering, and so the absolute level of performance of the methods is not characterized.  Reporting of distribution of sample weights and or run-times/complexity would strengthen the paper.\n\nClarity\n- notation is complex replete with symbols \"@\" and text in math formulas\n- It's not clear what p (\"the data model\") and p_miss (\"the missingness mechanism\") represent, and therefore why in equation 1: p(x,z) = p(xvz)p_miss(z| xvz) where v is the union symbol.  In addition, how it's related to MAR and MNAR is unclear. If e.g. following Murphy, one writes MAR as: p(r|x_u, x_o) = p(r|x_o), r is a missingness vector, x_u is x unobserved, and x_o is x observed, then r corresponds to observation or not, whereas in the manuscript p_miss is on the values themselves, i.e. on the space where z={k_{i,j}@t_{i,j}} resides.  We know, from the definition of MNAR that we can't use only the observed data to correctly infer the distributions of the missing values, and so while one can probabilistically predict in MNAR setting, their quality remains unknown.  If none of the experiments touch upon MNAR data, perhaps it is possible to omit this part.\n\nOriginality\n+ the work is rich, complex, original, and uses leading methods from multiple areas of ML.\n\nSignificance\n+ the significance of this work could be high, as it may provide a way to conduct difficult inference in an effective way to produce increasingly flexible modeling of trajectories amidst partial observation.\n- however the exposition (particularly the experiments) does not fully demonstrate this.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
