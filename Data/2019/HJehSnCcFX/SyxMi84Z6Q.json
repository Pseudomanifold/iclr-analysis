{"title": "This paper proposes an algorithm for missing data problem in continuous time events data (ie, point processes) where both past and future events are helpful. ", "review": "This paper tackles a very important and practical problem in event stream planning. The problem is very interesting and the approach taken is standard.\n\nThe presentation of the paper is not clear enough. The notations and definitions and methods are presented in a complicated way. It's difficult to follows.\n\nFrom the contribution point of view the paper looks like to be a combination of several existing and well developed approach: Neural Hawkes Process + particle smoothing + minimum bayes risk + alignment. It's not very surprising to see these elements together. It would have helped if the authors made it clear why each part is chosen and clearly state what is the novelty and contributed of the paper to the field.\n\nThe paper in its current format is not ready for publication. But it's a good paper and can be turned to a good paper for the next venue.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
