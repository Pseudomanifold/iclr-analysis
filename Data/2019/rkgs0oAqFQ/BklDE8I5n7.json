{"title": "Simple solution, large improvements.", "review": "This authors propose a solution to the problem of over-smoothing in Graph conv networks that prevents knowledge propagation between distant yet related nodes. Specifically, they allow dense propagation between all related nodes, weighted by the mutual distance. Dense connections ensure influence of related nodes and distance weighting moderates this influence based on proximity of nodes. The scheme is used for knowledge graph based zero-shot learning. Like Wang et. al. 2018, their model learns to predict pre-trained weights of known classifiers and infer, using the knowledge graph, weights for unseen classes.  The simple fix to graph propagation seems to produce large gains over zero-shot baselines (Table 1 & 2). I think the solution is intuitive and results are really good. Therefor, I am in favor of accepting. ", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
