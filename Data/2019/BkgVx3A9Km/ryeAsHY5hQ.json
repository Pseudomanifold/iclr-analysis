{"title": "TripMap needs more comparison and validation ", "review": "In this paper, the authors present a novel dimensionality reduction method named TriMap. TriMap attempts to improve upon the widely-adopted t-SNE algorithm by incorporating global distances through the use of triplets, rather than pairwise comparisons. The authors compare to t-SNE, as well as a newer method called LargeVis which also claims to impose a global distances metric. The authors show that their method is more robust to the addition or removal of clusters and outliers and provides a more meaningful global distance relative to the methods against which they compare.\n\nTechnical Quality\nThe authors\u2019 method is clear and well described and addresses a poignant issue in dimensionality reduction. However, the authors fail to compare their method to a number of relevant dimensionality reduction algorithms which also claim to provide solutions with globally meaningful distances. Such methods include force-directed graph drawing (Fruchterman & Reingold, 1991), diffusion maps (Coifman & Lafon, 2006) and PHATE (Moon et al., 2017). \n\nAdditionally, the handling of outliers is a concern. While the authors claim that the retention of outliers as disconnected from the manifold is a desirable quality of their technique, the presence of many outliers in a dataset (for example, in the Tabula Muris and lyrics datasets) has the potential to mask the interesting portion of the dimensionality reduction. It may be worth commenting on the desirability to identify and remove outliers, and the provision of such a technique in the software upon its release.\n\nFinally, the runtime comparison is of concern. It is common to perform most DR methods on high-dimensional PCA representation of the data, particularly in single-cell genomics (e.g. the Tabula Muris dataset in Part 3.) In this context, both UMAP and PHATE successfully embed the Tabula Muris dataset in less than the reported TriMap time (3.5 and 5 minutes respectively, compared to 15 minutes reported for TriMap.)\n\nNovelty\nThe authors\u2019 method appears to provide improved results over the compared alternatives, however, it is worth noting that triplet-based embedding is not novel in its own right (van der Maaten & Weinberger, 2012), though one could argue novelty is warranted here due to claimed substantial improvements of results. In this case, the authors should include a comparison to competing triplet-based methods, at least in the appendix. \n\nPotential impact\nThe authors\u2019 method has the potential to be used widely across many fields, as a direct replacement for t-SNE. Its adoption is contingent on compelling evidence that it produces results substantially better than UMAP (which is currently heralded as an upcoming replacement for t-SNE in some fields) and other competing methods. The authors may find it worthwhile to provide such comparisons, if not in the main body of the paper at least in the appendix. \n\nClarity\nThe paper is easy to read and makes its point in a reasonably concise manner. Detailed explanation of experiments v) and vi) could be relegated to the appendix. More precise statement of the authors\u2019 tests in Part 2 could be provided by quantifying the results of the tests in a more precise way; it is not clear what the authors seek to achieve by drawing the dotted lines between clusters in Figure 1a, or by providing AUC values in Figure 1.\n\nDetailed Comments\n\u2022\tIn the definition of Equation 2, it is not until one paragraph later than q_{ij}^{~(t\u2019)} is defined \u2013 this is confusing and hard to read.\n\u2022\tThe captions for Figures 1 and 3 would be substantially clearer with more detail on the dataset analyzed and in Figure 1, some discussion of the purpose of each subplot.\n\u2022\tThe Figure 3 caption needs a semicolon or period before introducing the bottom panel.\n\u2022\tThe claim that the authors\u2019 heuristic triplet sampling (nearest-neighbor and random sampling) is sufficient to approximate full triplet sampling should be shown in the appendix.\n\u2022\tThe collaboration network analyzed in Part 3 is naturally a graph; it would make sense to cluster and visualize this using a graph-based clustering, rather than coercing it to Euclidean coordinates.\n\n(Note: after reading the revised manuscript I have changed my recommendation from a 6 to a 5)\n\nReferences\nCoifman, R.
