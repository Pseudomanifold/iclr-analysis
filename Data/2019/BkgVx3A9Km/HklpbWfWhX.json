{"title": "A More Globally Accurate Dimensionality Reduction Method Using Triplets ", "review": "Authors propose a new method called TriMap, which captures higher orders of structure with triplet information, and minimize a roust loss function for satisfying the chosen triplets.\n \nThe proposed method is motivated by the misleading selection approach for a dimensionality reduction method using local measurements. And then, authors resort to an evaluation based on visual clues based on a number of transformations. Authors then claim that any DR method preserving the global structure of the data should be able to handle these transformations.  An example on MNIST data illustrate these properties, but it is still not clear what are the visual clues as the criterion to select a good DR method and what are the global structures.\n \nAuthors discussed the results in Figure 4 for six real-world datasets, but there is no convincing evidence from the corresponding domains or reference researches for the support of the global structure in the learned embedding space.  It will be good to add some convincing evidences for the conclusion.\n \nAs the method highly depends on the subset of sampled triplets, it is interesting to see how the global structure changes if a different set of triplets is used.  In addition, it is unclear why sampled triplets can achieve a global structure of data instead of pairwise relations. From the experiments, triplets are also sampled according to the pairwise nearest neighbor graph.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
