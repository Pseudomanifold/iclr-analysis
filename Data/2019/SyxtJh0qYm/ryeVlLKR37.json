{"title": "Solid work on using VAEs for feature imputation", "review": "This paper introduces the VAEAC model, inspired by CVAEs, it allows conditioning on any subset\nof the latent features. This provides a model able to achieve good results on image inpainting\nand feature imputation tasks.\n\nThe paper appears to be technically sound, and the experiments are\nthoughtfully designed. The writing is clear and the model is easy to\nunderstand. The closest work to this of the Universal Marginalizer is\ncompared to well, with more compelling examples in the appendix. I\nwould have preferred if more of the experimental results were in the\nmain paper instead of in the appendix especially as the authors state\nthey chose to highlight their better results in the main paper.\n\nWhile not the first model to try to handle modeling data with missing features, it is\nstill a fairly original and elegant formulation.\n\nMinor details:\n\nIn equation (8) should x be x_b?\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
