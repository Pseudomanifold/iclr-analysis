{"title": "DRL for malware control", "review": "The paper proposes an approach to use deep reinforcement learning to halt execution in detecting malware attacks. The approach seems interesting, there are some problems.\n\n1. There is no good justification of using DRL to the problem. Action space is only continue and halt. Besides there should be no effect to the result by the previous action. So I don't think DRL is a good selection.\n2. Experiments are weak. There is no detailed comparison to other existing works. Only one dataset is used.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
