{"title": "A good paper", "review": "The authors make use of the theory of functional gradient, based on optimal transport, to develop a method that can promote the entropy of the generator distribution without directly estimating the entropy itself. Theoretical results are provided as well as necessary experiments to support their technique's outperformance in some data sets. I found that this is an interesting paper, both original ideal and numerical results.", "rating": "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "confidence": "1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess"}
