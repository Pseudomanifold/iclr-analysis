{"title": "review of the paper", "review": "This is a good paper. First of all, it presents a large-scale corpus for visual speech recognition. Second, it demonstrates a visual speech recognition system based on open-vocabulary that gives the state-of-the-art recognition accuracy.  The paper is very well written and all the technical details are clearly laid out.  I, for one, would like to thank the authors for this meticulous work to the community.   This is by far the largest dataset and the most impressive performance for VSR I have even seen in the ASR/VSR community.  I enjoyed reading this paper.  \n\nI extend this review based on the replies.  One of the arguments is that the work presented in this paper is a great success in engineering but it lacks technical novelty and therefore can not be accepted by the conference, which I think otherwise.  First of all, the authors put together a very detailed and carefully designed technical pipeline for creating a very large visual speech recognition dataset, which is a valuable contribution to be community.  (I assumed that the databset will become available to the community when reviewing the paper, which turned out not to be totally accurate. My apologies.  I do hope the dataset will be made public.  This is a major reason I gave a high score.)  Second,  the authors have built systems that give the state-of-the-art performance on visual speech recognition. Although the models and architectures are already out there,  the impressive performance itself is an impact to the field.  This is not simply achieved by piling in a large amount of data (although it does play a role). This is a system paper but its impact and its performance should at least get it in to the conference.
