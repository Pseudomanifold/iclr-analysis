{"title": "Interesting results, but somewhat lacking in novelty", "review": "The authors propose a method to use the distribution learned by Quantile Regression (QR) DQN (Dabney et al.) for exploration. This is accomplished by computing an estimate of the variance from the QR value function and using this as an exploration bonus for generating actions, in place of the usual epsilon-greedy strategy.\n\nThe novelty of this method is somewhat low and a few parts of the algorithm and their uses are unclear. From the text of the paper it seems like the authors are using this exploration bonus for action selection and the update \u201cremains the same\u201d. However in Algorithm 3 the update for the value function has been modified to include this bonus in the Bellman update (line 2).\n\nIt is also somewhat unclear that this is the right approach to take for exploration, and the authors do not discuss this fact. QR-DQN provides an update for which the learned distribution will converge towards the inherent distribution of values due to the noise in the environment. However, there is no guarantee (e.g. with high probability) that the intermediate values will upper bound the true value. Further, it is possible that this leads to an agent that becomes \u201caddicted to noise\u201d. IE since this should converge to the true noise of the system an agent may continue to revisit states that are \u201cuncertain\u201d only due to irreducible noise from the environment.\n\nFinally, the authors provide a somewhat odd presentation of UCB-style algorithms. There is an odd distinction made between the \u201coptimism in the face of uncertainty\u201d approach and the optimistic setting of Sutton et al. These algorithms differ, but are fundamentally related via the optimism line of reasoning. Further, approaches based on optimism in this way go back to Lai and Robbins (1985) and are not necessarily based on Hoeffdings Inequality, but rather the more general idea of a high-probability bound on the value. Finally, the authors also give great weight to asymmetry in their introduction of the variance, however this overlooks the frequent use of so-called \u201cone sided\u201d bounds.\n\nOverall, this approach does have some interesting results, however it is a relatively simple modification of QR-DQN, and it is unclear that it is more generally applicable. \n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
