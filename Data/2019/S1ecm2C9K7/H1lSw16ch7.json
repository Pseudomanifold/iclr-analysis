{"title": "Interesting result, need more comparison in the experiment section, need more explaining of related work", "review": "In this paper, the authors studied bias amplification. They showed in some situations bias is unavoidable; however, there exist some situations in which bias is a consequence of weak features (features with low influence to the classifier and high variance). Therefore, they used some feature selection methods to remove weak features; by removing weak features, they reduced the bias substantially while maintaining accuracy (In many cases they even improved accuracy).  Showing that weak features cause bias is very interesting, especially in their real-world dataset in which they improved bias and accuracy simultaneously.  \n\n\nMy main concerns about this paper are its related work and its writing.\nAuthors did a great job in reviewing related work for bias amplification in NLP or vision. \nHowever, they studied bias amplification in binary classification, in particular, they looked at GNB; and they did not review the related work about bias in GNB.  I think it is clear that using MAP causes bias amplification. Therefore, I think changing theorem 1 to a proposition and shifting the focus of the paper to section 2.2 would be better. Right now, I found feature orientation and feature asymmetry section confusing and hard to understand. In the paper, the authors claimed bias is a consequence of gradient descent\u2019s inductive bias, but they did not expound on the reasoning behind this claim. Although the authors ran their model on many datasets, there is no comparison with previous work. So it is hard to understand the significance of their work. It is also not clear why they don\u2019t compare their model with \\ell_1 regularization in CIFAR.\n\n\nMinor:\n\nPaper has some typos that can be resolved.\nCitations have some errors, for example, Some of the references in the text does not have the year, One paper has been cited twice in two different ways, For more than two authors you should use et al., sometimes \\citet and \\citep are used instead of each other.\nAuthors sometimes refer to the real-world experiment without first explaining the data which I found confusing.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
