{"title": "Good work", "review": "Multimodality learning is an important topic in multimedia and human computer interaction.  How to efficiently leverage the additional information cross multimodality is the key to the task. Authors proposed the Bayesian latent variable model to factorize the multimodality representation into multimodal discriminative factors and modality-specific generating factors, which is interesting. Approximate inference is also proposed to learn this model via a generalised mean-field assumption. \n\nThe technical quality of the paper is sound and significant, The problem to solve in this paper is also well motivated and important.  In general, this is a well-written paper, \n\nI have a few minor questions which requires authors for further elaboration.\n1. If I understand it correctly, in the current work, the feature Xs are continuous. Does the approach apply to categorical or binary features?\n\n2. In equation(4), MMD is used. How to solve the computation complexity problem since the complexity of MMD is O(n^2)?  It is true that the batch size should be small?  How to select the hyper-parameters of kernels?\n\n ", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}
