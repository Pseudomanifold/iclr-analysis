{"title": "interesting problem", "review": "I have read the discussion from the authors. my evaluation stays the same.\n--------\nthis paper studies an interesting question of how to learn causal effects from observational data generated from reinforcement learning. they work with a very challenging setting where an unobserved confounder exists at each time step that affects actions, rewards and the confounder at next time step.\n\nthe authors fit latent variables models to the observational data and perform experiments.\n\nthe major concern is on the causal inference side, where it is not easy to claim anything causal in such a complicated system with unobserved confounders. causal inference with unobserved confounders cannot be simply solved by fitting a latent variable model. there exists negative examples even in the simplest setting that two distinct causal structure can lead to the same observational distribution. for example here, https://www.alexdamour.com/blog/public/2018/05/18/non-identification-in-latent-confounder-models/\n\nit could be helpful if the authors can lay out the identification assumptions for causal effects. before claiming anything causal and justifying experimental results.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
