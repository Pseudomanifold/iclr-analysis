{"title": "Paper lacks algorithmic innovation and does not give new theoretical or empirical insights in multi-agent learning.", "review": "Summary\n\nThe authors evaluate a standard policy gradient approach on a multi-agent Capture the Flag environment. The agents have partial observability and share rewards. The learning approach also use a curriculum learning approach. The authors report the policy behavior during training, but do not visualize or quantitatively analyze the learned agent behaviors.\n\nPro\n- A new multi-agent environment could be an interesting starting point for future research.\n\nCon\n- The authors do not present a significant new algorithmic or empierical innovation. \n- The authors do not demonstrate compelling empirical insights in the learned behavior of the agents. \n- The authors do not address any inherent difficulties with multi-agent learning (non-stationary environemnt, inducing cooperation, etc).", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
