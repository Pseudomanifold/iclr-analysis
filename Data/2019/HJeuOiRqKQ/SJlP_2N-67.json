{"title": "Ask good questions but need more insightful analysis", "review": "The work does an analysis of impact of different pooling strategies on image classification with deformations. It shows different pooling strategies reach to similar levels of deformation stability after sufficient training. It also offers an alternative technique with smoothness filters with to CNNs more stable. \nPros:\nThe paper considers a wide variety of pooling strategies and deformation techniques for evaluation.  Fair experiments with conclusion of similar stability of different pool layers after training is very evident.\nCons:\ni) Results on CIFAR 10 show pooling has little effect but is it unnecessary for harder problems as well? What about human pose datasets where deformation is inherent?\niii) Although, the results presented on smoother filter initialization are interesting, but these results are not compared in a one to one setting to different pooling methods, convolutions or residual networks. \n\nThis paper tries to argue that pooling is unnecessary for deformation invariance, as title suggests, and proposes initialization based on smooth filters as an alternative. Results are presented on CIFAR 10 to show the same, albeit on a trained network. However, CIFAR 10 is not a difficult dataset and the level of cosine sensitivity (shown as same with and without pooling) could very well be a steady state for the specific classification task. Imagenet dataset doesn't seem to show ablative studies. So this little evidence is insufficient to conclude that pooling is unnecessary.  Also as mentioned in the conclusion of the paper, the effect of pooling through the course of training would add more weight.
