{"title": "Interesting paper", "review": "The authors propose a novel architecture for RL-based web navigation to address both of these problems, DOM-Q-NET, which utilizes a graph neural network to represent tree-structured HTML along with a shared state space across multiple tasks. It is believed more flexible to be probed on WorldOfBits environments. Significant improvements are shown by experiment.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess"}
