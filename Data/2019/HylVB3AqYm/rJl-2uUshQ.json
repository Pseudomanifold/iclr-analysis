{"title": "Solid work with convincing results", "review": "It seems the authors propose an efficient method to search platform-aware network architecture aiming at high recognition accuracy and low latency. Their results on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet are surprisingly good.  But it is still hard to believe that the author can  achieve 2.08% error rate with only 5.7M parameter on CIFAR10 and 74.5% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with less GPU hours/memories than prior arts.\n\nGiven my concerns above, the author must release their code and detail pipelines since NAS papers are difficult to be reproduced. \n\nThere is a small typo in reference part:\nJing-Dong Dong's work should be DPP-Net instead of PPP-Net (https://eccv2018.org/openaccess/content_ECCV_2018/papers/Jin-Dong_Dong_DPP-Net_Device-aware_Progressive_ECCV_2018_paper.pdf)\nand I think this paper \"Neural Architecture Optimization\" shoud be cited.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}
