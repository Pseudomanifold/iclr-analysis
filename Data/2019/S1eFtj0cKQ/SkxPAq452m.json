{"title": "A comprehensive evaluation of existing methods lacking novelty and insight", "review": "This paper evaluates and compares various methods for learning GANs in a Continual Learning setting, i.e., only some of the classes are available during training. It evaluates different continual learning methods including rehearsal, EWC and generative replay applied to training several deep generative models, like GAN, CGAN, WGAN, WGAN-GP, VAE and CVAE on MNIST, Fashion MNIST and CIFAR. The authors conclude with these experimental results that generative replay is the most effective method for such a setting, and found it is difficult to generate CIFAR10 images that can be classified successfully by an image classifier.\n\nI appreciate the authors for providing so much detailed experimental results to the community, but this paper lacks novelty in general. All the CL methods the authors evaluate come from other papers that are already using these methods for generative models: rehearsal has been used in VCL Nguyen et al. (2017), EWC comes directly from Seff et al. (2017), and generative replay has been used by Wu et al. (2018a). The authors also fail to provide any valuable insight with these experimental results, e.g., analyzing why generative replay fails to improve VAEs. \n\nI expect to see more exciting results coming from the authors, but the paper is not mature enough for acceptance this time.\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
