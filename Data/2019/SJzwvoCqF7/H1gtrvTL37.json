{"title": "An improved and new characterization of generalization bound ", "review": "The rebutal and the revision of the paper solve my comments.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThe paper presents a new characterization of generalization error bound for general deep neural networks in terms of the depth and width of the networks and the spectral norm of weight matrices. The proof follows the setting of Bartlett et al. 2017 with new development on the Lipschitz properties of neural networks.\n\nPros:\n1. The paper provides a solid improvement over previous bounds on generalization error.\n2. The presentation of the result and proofs is clear and easy to follow.\n3. It does case studies specially on widely used network structures CNN, ResNet, etc.\n\nCon:\n1. It is not clear whether the bound is vacuous or not, as discussed in Arora et al. 2018.  If it is vacuous, it is hard to justify the claims that given the generalization error, which is vacuous for all bounds, the paper's bound allows the choices of larger dimensions of parameters and larger spectral norms of weight matrices.\n2.  The L_w has the factor \"products of B_{d,2}s\" which, however, does not show up in the final generalization bound (The equation right above Appendix B). This products may introduce an additional $D$ under sqrt changing D to D^2 under the sqrt, which changes the order. The authors should give some explanation on this.\n\n3. Is the assumption on the orthogonal and normalized filters in CNN a must thing for the argument or just for convenience of the presentation? The paper should be clearer about this point.\n\n4. The RHS of the equation  in Lemma 2 misses terms related with B_{d,2}.\n5.
