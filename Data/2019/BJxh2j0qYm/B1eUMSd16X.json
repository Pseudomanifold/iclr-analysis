{"title": "feature suppression to speed up training CNN", "review": "This manuscript presents a nice method that can dynamically prune some channels in a CNN network to speed up the training. The main strength of the proposed method is to determine which channels to be suppressed based upon each data sample without incurring too much computational burden or too much memory consumption.  The good thing is that the proposed pruning strategy does not result in a big performance decrease. Overall, this is a nicely written paper and may be empirically useful for training a very large CNN. Nevertheless, the authors did not present a real-world application in which it is important to speed up by 2 or 3 times at a small cost, so it is hard to judge the real impact of the proposed method.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
