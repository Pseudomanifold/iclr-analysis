{"title": "TRANSFER LEARNING FOR RELATED REINFORCEMENT LEARNING TASKS VIA IMAGE-TO-IMAGE TRANSLATION", "review": "The paper seeks to generalize the reinforcement learning agents to related tasks. The authors first show the failure of conventional transfer learning techniques, then use GANs to translate the images in the target task to those in the source task. It is an interesting attempt to use the style-transferred images for generalization of RL agents. The paper is well written and easy to follow.\nPros:\n1.\tIt is a novel attempt to use GANs to generate pictures that help RL agents transfer the policies to other related environments.\n2.\tIt is an interesting viewpoint to use the performance of RL agent to evaluate the quality of images generated by GANS.\nCons:\n1.\tThe pictures generated by GANs can be hardly controlled, and extra noise or unseen objects might be generated, and may fool the RL agent during training.\n\nOther feedback:\nIn Figure 2, it seems the fine-tuning methods also achieve comparable results (Full-FT and Partial-FT), such as Figure 2(b) and Figure 2(c). Besides, the plot is only averaged over 3 runs, whereas the areas of standard deviation still overlap with each other. It may not be convincing enough to claim the failure of fine-tuning methods.\n\nMinor typos:\n1.\tIn 2.1, second paragraph: 80x80 -> $80 \\times 80$\n2.\tIn 2.1, second paragraph: chose -> choose\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
