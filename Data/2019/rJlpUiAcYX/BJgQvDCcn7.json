{"title": "The paper is well written and is, in my opinion, a good contribution to the literature. ", "review": "The authors introduce a novel distance function between point sets, based on the \"permutation invariance\" of the zeros of a polynomial, calling it \"holographic\" distance, as it essentially depends on all the points of the sets being compared. They also consider two other permutation invariant distances, and apply these in an end-to-end object detection task. These distance functions have time-complexity O(N^2) unlike the previously proposed \"Hungarian distance\" based on the Hungarian algorithm which is O(N^3) in general. Moreover, they authors show that in two dimensions all local minima of the holographic loss are global minima.\n\nPros: The paper is well written, the ideas are clearly and succinctly presented. Exploiting the connection between 2D point sets and zeros of polynomials is an interesting idea.\n\nCons: The experimental section could be better. For example, the authors could do simple experiments to show how an optimization algorithm would explore the holographic loss surface (in terms of hitting global/local minima) in dimensions greater than two. Also, in the object detection example, no comparison is given with the Hungarian loss based algorithm of Stewart et al. (2016) (at the very least, the authors could train their neural nets using the Hungarian loss, choosing one optimal permutation at the \"transitioning points\") .", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
