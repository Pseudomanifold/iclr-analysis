{"title": "Review TLDR: Ok good fit for ICLR maybe even better for QIP ", "review": "Authors give a method to perform a full quantum problem of classifying unknown mixed quantum states. This is an important topic but the paper is ok and I think the test case is a bit lacking.\n\nThe theory  is sound and the math is good. The only question I have is how does this hold on a real quantum computer such as IBMQ/rigetti quantum computing etc.. or even under a noisy simulator \n\nAlthough the paper is sounds and it is a good idea, the presentation is a bit lacking. There are several typos and formatting problems, such as excess spaces and some sort of hex code (9b8d) in the abstract which I am guessing is left over from the NIPS template.\nTwo other things is that usually in double blind review one should not leave the emails with affiliation and one should anonymize the Acknowledgements as well.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
