{"title": "Classifying a quantum state with a neural network--Not sure ICLR has the right audience for this", "review": "Summary of paper:\nThe authors partially integrate a neural network into classical approaches to classify the state of a quantum circuit. The model is not actually clear in what it is doing, but there are some trained weights somewhere. They allow for an \"uncertainty\" prediction by giving one more node than there are classification targets, corresponding to a less-penalized uncertain prediction. They evaluate their model on numerical simulations.\n\nStrengths:\n-\nWeaknesses:\n- The neural network architecture is entirely standard with nothing new.\n- The paper is poorly written and very hard to follow.\n- The focus is almost exclusively on the application, and yet the application is not explained effectively.\n- The implication of the results and usefulness is not elaborated.\n- The particular contributions are not clear.\n\nSuggested Revisions:\n- What is the 9b8d in the first sentence of the abstract?\n- \"...been developed to address the question [of] whether quantum mechanics...\"\n- \"...for all the dataset[s] in Table 1...\"", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}
