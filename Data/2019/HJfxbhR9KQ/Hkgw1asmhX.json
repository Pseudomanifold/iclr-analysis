{"title": "Border line paper", "review": "The paper proposes an idea of using the most frequent expert action sequence to assist the novice, which, as claimed, has lower memory overhead than other imitation learning methodologies. The authors present comparison of their proposed method with state-of-the-art and show its superior performance. However I do have the following few questions. \n\n1. The proposed method requires a long time of GA3C training. How is that a fair comparison in Figure 2, where proposed method already has a lead over GA3C? It could be argued that it's not using all of the training outcome, but have the authors considered other form of experts and see how that works?\n\n2. The authors claimed one of the advantages of their method is reducing the memory overhead. Some supporting experiments will be more convincing.\n\n3. In Figure 3, atlantis panel, the score shows huge variance, which is not seen in Figure 2. Are they generated from the same runs? Could the authors give some explanation on the phenomenon in Figure 3?\n\nOverall, I think the paper has an interesting idea. But the above unresolved questions raises some challenge on its credibility and reproducibility.
