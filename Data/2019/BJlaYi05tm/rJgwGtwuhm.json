{"title": "Difficult to read, and I am unsure about relevance", "review": "Summary:\nThe paper is concerned with finding the preimage of of the features extracted by a series of convolution layers with ReLU activations. It is argued that these can be described through a series of nested polyhedral cones. This seem like a reasonable observation, but I am unsure why it is a particularly interesting observation. In the end, what does this tell me about the behavior of convolution layers?\n\nI found the paper very difficult to read; not so much because of the topic, but due the writing. Too often I simply do not understand individual sentences, and I am left to guess the intended meaning. In such scenarios, I cannot recommend acceptance.\n\nDetails (I am not including all my confusions here, but just a selection to keep review time manageable):\n*) References to figures appear to be incorrect. I think the authors accidentally refer to section numbers instead of figure numbers, but I am constantly left to guess which figure I should look at.\n\n*) Sentences often miss periods, and words are capitalized within sentences.\n\n*) It is chosen not to take subsampling or max pooling into account during the analysis. I can understand skipping max pooling, but why skip subsampling? Isn't that just a linear projection, which wouldn't affect the analysis?\n\n*) On page 2: \"Cones associated with successive layers are then in general partly nested inside their predecessor.\" I don't quite understand what is meant by \"partly nested\"; I get the intuition that two cones can intersect, but if the wording is supposed to mean something more specific, then I would like a more specific definition of \"partly nested\".\n\n*) On page 2: \"These hyperplanes divides the input space into a maximum of 2^d number of different cells with the maximum attained if all hyperplanes cut through the input space which we take as the non negative orthant of the d-dimensional Euclidean space R_+^d.\" I am not sure I understand this sentence, e.g. how can a hyperplane not cut through the input space? Should I read this as the input space is the non negative orthant? Why is that the input space? Is this based on the assumption of non negative pixel intensities? If so, why not include a maximal intensity such that the input space is a box?\n\n*) On  page 3: i is used as a general index as well as the negative half space index (i vs i_k). This is a bit confusing, so it might be good to rename one of the indices.\n\n*) On page 3, what does it mean for the set e_i to be \"complete\"? Do you mean that span({e_i}) = R^d ?\n\n*) It would be good to be more explicit about the term \"dual basis\" -- dual to what?\n\n*) On page 4: \"We now define the positive direction of the vector e_i as that associated with the negative side of the plane \u03a0_i\" (an example of a sentence missing a period, btw). What is the negative side of a plane?\n\n*) On page 4: \"We will exploit the fact that convolutional matrices are in most respects asymptotically equivalent to those of circulant matrices where each new row is a one element cyclic shift of the previous.\" (previous sentence miss a period, btw) and \"...this approximation will be negligible.\" I strongly miss either an explanation of this or a citation. As it stands, these are claims not facts.\n\n*) On page 5: \"The domain of the input that is mapped to output domain is just quite trivial planar manifolds.\" I don't understand this sentence.\n\n*) On page 8: \"The convolutional part of a deep network can therefore be seen as a component in a metric learning system where the purpose of the training will be to create domains in input space associated with different classes that are mapped to separate low dimensional outputs as a preprocessing for the final fully connected layers that will make possible efficient separation of classes.\" I don't understand how this conclusion is related to the analysis of the paper. I do not disagree with the quoted statement, but I miss how this is related to the analysis regarding nested cones.\n\n*) On page 9: Just below the figure caption appears an \"as\" that appear to have not relation to any other text in the paper.\n\n*) Citation 13: The authors name is misspelled, it should be \"Roweis\".\n", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}
