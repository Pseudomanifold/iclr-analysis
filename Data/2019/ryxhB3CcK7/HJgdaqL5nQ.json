{"title": "Need improvement on the presentation", "review": "This paper proposes a variational neural module networks (V-NMN), which compared to neural module networks (NMNs), is formed in a probabilistic aspect. The authors compare the performance of V-NMN and NMN on SHAPES dataset.\n\nI find the technical part is hard to follow. To optimize the objective function, it involves many challenges. The authors described those challenges as well. It is not clear to me how those challenges are solved in section 2.1. I think that the presentation in section 2.1 needs to provide more details.\n\nIn the experiment, the authors only compare their work with NMNs without comparing it with other approaches for visual question answering. Besides accuracy, does V-NMN provide new applications that NMNs and other VQA models is not applicable because of the probabilistic formulation?", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
