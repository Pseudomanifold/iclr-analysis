{"title": "Nice paper, well written and through evaluation", "review": "This paper proposes a discrete, structured latent variable model for visual question answering that involves compositional generalization and reasoning. In comparison to the existing approach, this paper well addressed the challenge of learning discrete latent variables in the presence of uncertainty. The results show a significant gain in performance as well as the capability of the model to generalize composition program to unseen data effectively. The qualitative analysis shows that the proposed model not only get the correct answer but also the correct behavior that leads to the answer.
