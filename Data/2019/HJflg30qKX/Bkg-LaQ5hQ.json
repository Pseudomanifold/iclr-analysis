{"title": "Strong guarantees for deep linear networks on separable data", "review": "In this work the authors prove several claims regarding the inductive bias of gradient descent and gradient flow trained on deep linear networks with linearly separable data. They show that asymptotically gradient descent minimizes the risk, each weight matrix converges to its rank one approximation and the top singular vectors of two adjacent weight matrices align. Furthermore, for the logistic and exponential loss the induced linear predictor converges to the max margin solution. \n\nThis work is very interesting and novel. It provides a comprehensive and exact characterization of the dynamics of gradient descent for linear networks. Such strong guarantees are essential for understanding neural networks and extremely rare in the realm of non-convex optimization results. The work is a major contribution over the paper of Gunasekar et al. (2018) which assume that the risk is minimized. The proof techniques are interesting and I believe that they will be useful in analyzing neural networks in other settings.\n\nRegarding Lemma 3, the proof is not clear. Lemma 8 does not exist in the paper of Soudry et al. (2017). It is also claimed that with probability 1 there are at most d support vectors. How does this relate with assumption 3, which implies that there are at least d support vectors?\n\n-------Revision---------\n\nThank you for the response. I have not changed the original review.\n", "rating": "9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
