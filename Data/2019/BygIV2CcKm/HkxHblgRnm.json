{"title": "valuable and publishable, some potential improvements", "review": "This paper proposes an extension of the influence function study of Koh and Liang (2017) to data augmentation.  Influence of augmentation, carried out via a parameterized and differentiable model, on validation loss is approximated and the augmentation model is learned under this approximation.  Overall I think it is a valuable and publishable contribution.  I do find the paper to be unclear and perhaps could be improved in a few ways.  My main comments are:\n\n* The biggest question I have is it seems from Eq. 15 that authors are proposing an augmentation approach where the augmented samples replace the original samples and not co-exist with them in the training set.  I am not sure why Eq. 15 has to be set up like that, please elaborate.\n\n* In Section 3.4 it is stated that only top fully connected layer of F is considered to compute influence function for augmentation.  Does this also mean that when F is updated on augmented data only the top layer is updated?  Please clarify.\n\n* The paper is a bit difficult to follow due to lack of clarity and few errors:\n     - Section 2.1, Adversarial methods, \u201cIn these methods, a simple composition\u2026adversarial examples\u201d sentence is unclear\n     - Page 2 footnote \u201chowever, they are referred to as unsupervised due to learning is not involved\u201d sentence is unclear\n     - Section 3.3 \\tilde{z} in first line should be \\tilde{z_i}\n     - Eq. 15 LHS should include \\tilde{z_i}\n     - Section 3.4 \u201cadopts\u201d -> \u201cadopt\u201d\n     - Section 3.4 \u201cHVP\u201d used without defining\n\n* Empirical evidence, while not extensive, is satisfactory.\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
