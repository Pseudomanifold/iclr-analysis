{"title": "Weak baseline comparisons and insufficient comparison with prior work", "review": "This paper describes a search space reduction method for neural network based keyboard input methods. The paper discusses two different sampling methods to restrict the vocabulary size during beam search.  \n\nTitle: The title of the paper is too generic to describe what is actually being done in the paper. Input methods in mobile devices could have also meant speech based input or handwriting based input or swipe based input. It would be very convenient for the readers if the authors use more specific wording in the title to clarify that they are talking about neural network based keyboard typing input.\n\nComparison with prior work: Neural network based on-device keyboard input is a research topic with a lot of previous contributions and the existing literature survey seems lacking. Further it does not even cover popular techniques for inference speed-up like hierarchical softmax computation. It would be easier for the reader to appreciate the  contributions of this paper if the authors compare and contrast with more relevant prior work.", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
