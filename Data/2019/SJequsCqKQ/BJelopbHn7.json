{"title": "Interesting for the ICLR community, but somewhat straightforward ", "review": "The paper proposes deep learning extension of the classic paradigm of 'conformal prediction'. Conformal prediction is similar to multi-label classification, but with a statistical sound way of thresholding each (class-specific) classifier: if our confidence in the assignment of an x to a class y is smaller than \\alpha, then we say 'do not know / cannot classify'). This is interesting when we expect out of distribution samples (e.g., adversarial ones).\n\nI think this paper, which is very well written, would make for nice discussions at ICLR, because it is (to my knowledge) the first that presents a deep implementation of the conformal prediction paradigm.  However, there are a couple of issues, which is why I think it is definitely not a must have at ICLR. The concrete, deep implementation of the approach is rather straightforward and substandard for ICLR: Features are taken from an existing, trained SOTA DNN, then input KDE, based on which for each class the quantiles are computed (using a validation set). Thus, feature and hypothesis learning are not coupled, and the approach requires quite a lot of samples per class (however, oftentimes in multi-label prediction we observe a Zipf law, ie many classes have fewer than five examples). Furthermore, there is no coupling between the classes; each class is learned separately; very unlikely this will work better than a properly trained multi-class or (e.g., one-vs.-rest) multi-label classifier in practice. Since a validation set is used to compute the quantiles, substantial 'power' is lost (data not used very efficiently; although that could be improved at the expense of expensive CV procedures).\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
