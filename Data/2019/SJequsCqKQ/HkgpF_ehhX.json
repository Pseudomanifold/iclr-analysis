{"title": "Conformal Methods", "review": "This paper applies Conformal Methods to multi-class classification. I am unfamiliar with the field, but the authors seem to be the first to attempt multiclass classification with Conformal Methods by estimating p(x|y) instead of the usual p(y|x). In doing so, they effectively build an independent classifier for each class that estimates whether an example comes from that class within a certain confidence which is set before training time.\nIn this way, they create meaning NULL predictions for an unidentified example, instead of the usual low-probability of an erroneous class.\nThe paper is well written, although it is difficult for me to work out which parts are the author's contributions, and which parts are tutorial/introduction to known Conformal Methods techniques, again this might be because this is not my subject area.\nThe ImageNet results look OK, not great, I would prefer to see a table in section 6.\nThe transfer of features from CelebA to IMDB-wiki is good, but it is hard to tell how good. I feel there should be more comparisons to other methods, even, perhaps an ROC curve for a set of 1 vs all mlp binary/SVM classifiers along with the conformal results (mlp using different cutoff thresholds, conformal method being trained with different confidence levels).\nI feel like this paper may be important, but it is a little difficult for me (myself) to judge without clear empirical evidence of a strong method vs other methods.\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}
