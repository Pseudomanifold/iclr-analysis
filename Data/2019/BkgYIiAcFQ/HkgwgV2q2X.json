{"title": "Theoretical Analysis of the forget gate behaviour leading to a nice novel contribution", "review": "This paper performs an analysis of the cell-state updating scheme of LSTM and realizes that it is mainly controlled by the forget gate. Based on these outcomes they reformulate the functions (interpreted as differential equations) to add a decay-behaviour in the forget gates, finally called DecayNet-LSTM.\n\n\nThe theoretical analysis in this paper is very welcome and goes beyond observations which we made in the past, i.e., we often saw similar behavior in our experiments and as the authors also state in Section 5, there have been previous observations and approaches. In 2016, I have seen an idea called Random Activation Preservation (RAP) (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7487778 ) which just randomly \"resets\" the gates. However, they only show empirical outcomes, not a sophisticated analysis as in this paper.\n\nIn the experiments it is shown, that the DecayNet-LSTM performs similarly, or sometimes better than simple LSTM on standard tasks. On more difficult tasks, such as Perm-SeqMNIST, a state-of-the-art performance is achieved.\n\nMinor comments:\nPlease note, it should be Long Short-Term Memory (with hyphen between short and term)\nYou call the contribution DecayNet; And in the paper sometimes refer to it as DecayNet-LSTM; Maybe there could also be a DecayNet-GRU, ... If you, instead of \"reformulation\", would clearly write that DecayNet is an addition to the LSTM architecture, it might be more clear.", "rating": "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
