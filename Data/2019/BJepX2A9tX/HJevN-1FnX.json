{"title": "interesting idea of some novelty, difficult to read if you're not an expert", "review": "The authors propose (1)  a new method for constructing rotation equivariant networks using 'conic' convolution, and then furthermore propose (2) to integrate the magnitude response of the 2D-discrete Fourier transform into a transition layer between convolutional and fully connected layers to get rotational invariance.  \n\nThe conceptual advantage over earlier approaches to (1) such as group convolution is that one operates only over the spatial domain., making it more intuitive (or so the authors claim) and also computationally more efficient.\n\nThe advantage of (2) is that invariance is achieved without throwing away useful information (such as earlier approaches did which took e.g. average or maximum. \n\nThe practical advantage of (1) and (2) is that the experiments suggests that it works better than earlier approaches. \n\nPRO\n- Both ideas are reasonable and the experiments suggest that they indeed improve noticeably on state of the art\n\nCON\n- Given the earlier work (especially the group convolution CNN) the developments here are not that surprising\n- The paper, while well-written in the sense of organization, grammar etc. was still quite a hard read for me; if one is not an expert on invariance/equivariance etc. then one has a hard time. Combining this paper with the Cohen/Welling paper I managed to understand most things in the end, and admittedly I am not an expert (something went wrong with the assignment process here...) but still, I feel things can be improved here. \n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}
