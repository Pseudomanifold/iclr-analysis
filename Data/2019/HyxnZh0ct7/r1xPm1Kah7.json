{"title": "results are not very promising", "review": "This paper proposes a new meta-learning method based on closed-form solutions for task specific classifiers such as ridge regression and logistic regression (iterative). The idea of the paper is quite interesting, comparing to the existing metric learning based methods and optimization based methods. \n\nI have two concerns on this paper. \nFirst, the motivation and the rationale of the proposed approach is not clear. In particular, why one can simply treat \\hat{Y} as a scaled and shifted version of X\u2019W?\n\nSecond, the empirical performance of the proposed approach is not very promising and it does not outperform the comparison methods, e.g., SNAIL.  It is not clear what is the advantage. \n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
