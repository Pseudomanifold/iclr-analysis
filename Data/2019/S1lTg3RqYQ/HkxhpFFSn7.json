{"title": "interesting submission with good intuition and evaluation", "review": "I enjoyed reading this manuscript. The paper is based on a simple idea used by others as well (i.e., the image has two components, one  that encode content which is shared across domains and another one characterizing the domain specific style). The other important idea is the use of feature masks that steer the translation process without requiring semantic labels. This is similar to attention models used by others but I think it is novel when applying to this specific application domain. I was a bit disappointed by the evaluation part. The authors decided to perform ablation and to show the importance of each component using only the MNIST-Single dataset. While this is good as a toy example I would have expected to see such analysis on a more complex example, e.g., street-view translation. This is also surprising considering that it is not even present in the supplementary material. Overall, this is a solid submission with interesting ideas and good implementation.
