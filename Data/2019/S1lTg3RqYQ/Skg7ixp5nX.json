{"title": "Interesting and well-written paper, but needs some clarification on the experiments", "review": "The paper is well organized with a clear idea of the proposed method and good related work descriptions. Overall, the descriptions are clear and easy to follow, but the experimental results need clarifying.\n\n- Regarding the multi-digit translation task, it is not straightforward to this reviewer how the proposed method could match the digits (semantic) with different colors (style) in different locations. The description in the paper is not enough to explain the results in Fig. 6. To this reviewer, this task is more complex than the street view translation one. In the same line, it is curious what the results would be if digits with different colors are overlapping at random location, rather than the grid-like arrangement.\u0000\n\n- For the potential readers who are not knowledgeable in semantic segmentation, please give the full name of mIoU for reference. \n\n- For further researches in this topic, it would be good to depict the limitations of the proposed method. For examples, the translated images in the CelebA dataset are not photorealistic (Fig. 8)  and there are odd red lights in the middle of the results in GTA5<-BDD (Fig. 12).\n\n- typos: Fig. 2-caption: m_{a}->m_{A}", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
