", "review": "Prons: \nThis paper provides an optimistic mirror descent algorithm to solving minmax optimization problem. Its global convergence is guaranteed under the coherence property. The experimental results are promising.\n\nCons: \n1.\tThe coherence property is still a strong assumption. The sufficient conditions provided in Corollary 3.2 and 3.3 to guarantee coherence property are too specific to cover existing GAN models.         \n\n2.\tThe current theoretical contribution seems incrementally. From the perspective of operator theory, the coherence property is highly related to the pseudo-monotone property. Extragradient method to solve the pseudo-monotone VIP has already existed in the literature [1]. The proposed OMD can be simply regarded a stochastic extension of [1] and simultaneously generalize the European distance in [1] to Bregman distance. \n\n3.\tThe integrating of Adam and OMD in the experiments is very interesting. To match the experiments, we highly recommend the authors to show the convergence of OMD + Adam with or without coherence condition, rather than requiring a diminishing learning rate.\n\n[1] Noor, Muhammad Aslam, et al. \"Extragradient methods for solving nonconvex variational inequalities.\" Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics 235.9 (2011): 3104-3108.\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
