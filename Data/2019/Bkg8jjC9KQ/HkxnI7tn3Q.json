{"title": "A good paper", "review": "This paper is trying to find a saddle-point of a Lagrangian using mirror descent. Mirror descent based methods use Bregman divergence to encode the convexity and smoothness of objective function beyond the euclidean structure. The main contribution of this paper is adding an extra gradient step to the standard MD, i.e., step 5 in Algorithm 2 as well as stochastic versions. Numerical experiments support their results.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
