{"title": "Very interesting contribution on weighted-tied random auto-encoder", "review": "Building on the recent progresses in the analysis of random high-dimensional statistics problem and in particular of message passing algorithm, this paper analyses the performances of weighted tied auto-encoder.  Technically, the paper is using the state evolution formalism. In particular the main theorem uses the analysis of the multi-layer version of these algorithm, the so-called state evolution technics, in order to analyse the behaviour of optimal decoding in weight-tied decoder. It is based on a clever trick that the behaviour of the decoding is similar to the one of the reconstruction on a multilayer estimation problem. This is a very orginal use of these technics.\n\nThe results are 3-folds: (i) a deep analysis of the limitation of weight-tied DAE, in the random setting, (ii) the demonstration of the sensitivity to perturbations and (iii) a clever method for initialisation that  to train a DAE.\n\nPro: a rigorous work, a clever use of the recent progresses in rigorous analysis of random neural net, and a very deep answer to interesting questions, and \nCon: I do not see much against the paper. A minor comment: the fact that the DAE is \"weight-tied\" is fundamental in this analysis. It actually should be mentioned in the title!\n\n", "rating": "9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
