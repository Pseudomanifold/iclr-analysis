{"title": "Riemannian Adam/Amsgrad on product manifolds with convergence guarantee but not supported well by experiments.", "review": "The paper extends Euclidean optimization methods, Adam/Amsgrad, to the Riemannian setting, and provides theoretical convergence analysis which includes the Euclidean versions as a special case. To avoid breaking the sparsity, coordinate-wise updates are performed on product manifolds. \n\nThe empirical performance seems not very good, compared to RSGD which is easier to use.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
