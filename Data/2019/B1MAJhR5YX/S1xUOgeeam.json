{"title": "A good paper, could be improved", "review": "This paper contributes to the study of the number of linear regions in ReLU neural networks. An approximate probabilistic counting algorithm is used to estimate the lower bound of that quantity, whereas an upper bound is derived analytically. The probabilistic counting algorithm is shown to be much more efficient than exact counting, and is adapted from the SAT literature. The new upper bound uses the weights of the network, a new technique compared to previous work on these bounds, and is shown to be sometimes tighter than the older bound.\n\nOverall, I am positive about the paper. Although I could not verify all proofs in detail, the ones I did verify were sound. The probabilistic counting algorithm seems like a good fit for this type of neural network problems, and is adapted and implemented nicely.\n\nIn my opinion, the paper can be improved substantially on these fronts:\n- Motivation: Can you point me to a reference where the number of linear regions is used as a measure of expressiveness, formally? I ask because the scope of the work in this paper is very much tied to that question.\n\n- Clarity: this issue must be addressed. The paper is quite technical (that's fine), but also difficult to parse. For example, it is not clear what's new in 4.1.\n\nMinor:\n- Figure1/Table1: please move them to experiments. You do not describe the tables and results early, which makes it useless at that stage of the paper. Why not just move them to experiments and describe/discuss these results in detail there?\n- Notation: In page 3, paragraph 2, you use x in many different shapes and forms (e.g. bold). Please consider making that notation consistent.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
