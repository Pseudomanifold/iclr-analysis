{"title": "Interesting, but incremental and of little practical use", "review": "The paper deals with a problem of expressiveness of a piecewise linear neural network, characterized by the number of linear regions of the function modeled. This is one of the widely accepted measure of expressiveness of a linear model. As such, it has been studied before. The main contributions of the paper are:\n1) Different algorithms are proposed that allow to compute the bounds faster, leveraging probabilistic algorithms\n2) Tighter bounds are obtained \nI find the results somewhat interesting. However, I do not think there is a lot of practical value in having faster algorithms for obtaining the bounds, as they are not used in practice anyway. I am also not convinced that the quest for tighter-and-tighter bounds in this approach is the right scientific direction. I find the paper to be an interesting contribution, but of a marginal value to the progress of the domain and for the improvement of our understanding of the models.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
