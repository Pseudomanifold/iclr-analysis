{"title": "The approach requires more validation", "review": "This paper constructs a very simple, new scheme for sampling mini-batches. It aims to (i) achieve the noise properties of sampling with replacement while (ii) reduce the probability of not touching a sample in a given epoch. The result is a biased sampling scheme called \u201csequenced-replacement sampling (SRS)\u201d. Experimental results show that this scheme performs significantly better than a standard baseline on CIFAR-100 with minor improvements on CIFAR-10. \n\nThis is a highly empirical paper that presents a simple and sound method for mini-batch sampling with impressive results on CIFAR-100. It however needs more thorough analysis or experiments that validate the ideas as also experiments on harder, large-scale datasets.\n\nDetailed comments:\n\n1. The authors are motivated by the exploration properties of sampling with replacement which I find quite vague. For instance, https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.11029 , https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07562 etc. show that sampling mini-batches with replacement has a large variance than sampling without replacement and consequently SGD has better regularization properties. Also, for mini-batches sampled with replacement, the probability of not sampling a given sample across an epoch is very small.\n\n2. I believe the sampling scheme is unnecessarily complicated. Why not draw samples with replacement with a probability p and draw samples without replacement with a probability 1-p? Do the experimental results remain consistent with this more natural sampling scheme which also aligns with the motivations of the authors?\n\n3. To validate the claim that SRS works well when there are fewer examples per class, can you do ablation experiments on CIFAR-10 or ImageNet/restricted subset of it?", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
