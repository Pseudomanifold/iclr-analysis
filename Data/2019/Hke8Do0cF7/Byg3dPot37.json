{"title": "The paper \"DEEP PROCESSING OF STRUCTURED DATA\" is about transforming an arbitrary number of fixed-length input vectors to a fixed-length output vector for a neural network.", "review": "+ Results for SAN are on par with hand-crafted feature sets.\n+ An easy to implement strategy to get from a set of an arbitrary number of fixed-length input vectors to one fixed-length output vector representing the set.\n\n\n- The work is quite straight-forward and incremental as it basically replaces max-pooling with another function (RELU).\n- Adding zero tuples (x,0) as input for the SAN is basically zero-padding. Therefore, the differences/advantages to zero padding and other pooling strategies do not become clear.\n- The obvious baseline of using doc2vec for text classification is missing. This baseline would be beneficial to set the results into context. \n- Reference to Schlichtkrull et al. [1] is missing who are actually doing something quite similar for graph data.\n\n\nSince the work is quite straight-forward and the comparisons to related work are not sufficiently covered, I am currently leaning towards rejecting this paper.\n\n\n\n[1] Schlichtkrull, M., Kipf, T.
