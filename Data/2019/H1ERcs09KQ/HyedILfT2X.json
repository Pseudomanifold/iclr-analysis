{"title": "nested CRP plus neural network", "review": "The paper proposes using the nested CRP as a clustering model rather than a topic model. The clustering is on the latent vector input into a neural network for generating the observation. A variational approach is derived.\n\nThe proposed model seems like a straightforward extension of the nCRP with a deep model hanging off the end of it. A significant concern/confusion for me is that this doesn't seem to be a mixed membership model, and so I don't know how meaningful it is to generate a level distribution from a Dirichlet and then draw from that mixture one time. From the generative model it seems every data point has its own Dirichlet vector on levels. For topic models this makes sense since that vector is then drawn from multiple times (once per word) from a Discrete, so there's a distribution to actually learn. My understanding is that this isn't being done here.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
