{"title": "Lack of clarity and limited experimental success", "review": "This paper presents a generalization of TransE to Riemannian manifolds. While this work falls into the class of interesting recent approaches for using non-Euclidean spaces for knowledge graph embeddings, I found it very hard to digest (e.g. the first paragraph in Section 3.3). Figure 3 and 4 confused me more than helping me to understand the method. Furthermore, current neural link prediction methods are usually evaluated on FB15k and WN18. In fact, often on the harder variants FB15k-237 and WN18RR. For FB15k and WN18, Riemannian TransE seems to underperform compared to baselines -- even for low embedding dimensions, so I have doubts how useful this method will be to the community and believe further experiments on FB15k-237 and WN18RR need to be carried out and the clarity of the paper, particularly the figures, needs to be improved. Lastly, I would be curious about how the different Riemannian TransE variants compare to TransE in terms of speed?\n\nUpdate: I thank the authors for their response and revision of the paper. To me, results on WN18RR and FB15k-237 are inconclusive w.r.t. to the choice of using Riemannian as opposed to Euclidean space. I therefore still believe this paper needs more work before acceptance.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}
