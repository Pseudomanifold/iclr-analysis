{"title": "Extrinsic reward and intrinsic reward are confusing", "review": "This paper studies multi-agent reinforcement learning where the agents need to communicate information when observations are noisy.  The agents thus need to learn what information should be sent to other agents.\n\nThe authors claim \"we do not assume the existence of explicit rewards guiding the communication action,\" which however is questionable.  The \"extrinsic reward\" used to guide the communication action is simply the cumulative reward between two communication actions.  The reward is explicitly given.\n\nThe key assumption is that communication is not performed every step.  Then standard cumulative reward until the next communication can be used as immediate reward for the previous communication.  Should this assumption be considered as an assumption of the domain where the proposed approach can be applied, or is this assumption rather a technique that one should use even when communication can be performed every step?  In the latter case, the effectiveness is sparse communication is not demonstrated.\n\nIn addition, the intrinsic reward for guiding environmental actions is unclear.  In the experiment, the standard reward is simply used as intrinsic reward.  So, intrinsic reward is just standard (extrinsic) reward?  In general, how should we design intrinsic reward?  What is the advantage of not using the standard reward as intrinsic reward?\n\nThe experimental settings are too ideal for the proposed approach, and it is unclear how the proposed approach work in practical settings.  In particular, sequential decision making is not essential in the experimental settings.  What are the real applications in mind?\n", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
