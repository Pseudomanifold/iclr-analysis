{"title": "The idea seems interesting but both the contribution and evaluation are not strong enough for the paper to be accepted, the proposed objective function is also questionable. ", "review": "This paper proposes an extension to hredGAN, which is an adversarial framework for multi-turn dialogue model, to simultaneously learns a set of attribute embeddings that represents the persona of each speaker and generate persona-based responses. The generator of the proposed system phredGAN is conditioned on both the history utterances and the speakers\u2019 persona by concatenating the utterance encoding with attribute embeddings. For discriminator, the authors explore two versions: 1) phredGAN_a takes attributes as inputs; 2) phredGAN_d adds a dual discriminator that predicts the attribute(s) for each utterance. \n\n\nStrength: 1) to the best of my knowledge, adding persona information to an adversarial multi-turn dialogue model is novel; 2) the authors explore two different approaches to build the discriminator(s) and the idea of adding a second discriminator that predicts the attributes seems interesting.    \n\n\nWeakness:\n\n1) Novelty: The idea of learning speaker-specific attribute embeddings is very similar to the Speaker Model proposed by Li et al.(2016) http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P16-1094 and the proposed system only makes minor changes to hredGAN https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.11752.  \n\n\n2) Presentation: \nThe writing of this paper is a little hard to follow, for example, it presents the two discriminators after the objective function (Equation 2) and does not explain the intuition behind each model. In Equation 2, the objective function, why training the discriminator to minimize the attributes prediction probability\uff1f Simply saying the attribute prediction loss is collaborative is not clear enough. Or is the min for the second term a typo? \n\n\n3) Model:\nThe idea of adding a discriminator that predicts the attributes seems interesting. However the loss is not adversarial for the second discriminator (Equation 6), you should not indicate L_att is GAN in your notation. I\u2019m also not convinced that this should be collaborative. Despite that the \u201cdiscriminator\u201d is trying to predict the correct attribute id, the input of the two terms in Equation 6 is different, one comes from the true data, the other comes from the generator. Shouldn\u2019t the discriminator try to differentiate these two cases? Otherwise, it\u2019s not a discriminator (also raise the question for Equation 2, why argmin min(L_att)).\n\n\n4) Evaluation\uff1a\nThe evaluation is not strong enough to demonstrate the benefit of the proposed model. \n\na. It only compares against one previous work that takes speaker identity into account on one dataset. Despite that the authors apply several different metrics to evaluate the proposed model, they only compare with previous models by Li et al. (2016) on perplexity and BLEU. \n\nb. The perplexity scores of the proposed models are worse than SAM by Li et al. (2016). The authors explain this by stating that the entropy for a multi-turn model is supposed to be higher than the single-turn model. It\u2019s better to provide a more rigorous analysis. For a fair comparison, they could also train the proposed model using only one-turn history, which should be identical to Li et al.\u2019s setting (How many turns history are you using?). The improvements of the BLEU score might also be the consequence of substituting the past generated sequence in the generator with ground truth (since the model uses the same training algorithm as hredGAN https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.11752). It\u2019s unclear if this is the cause unless the authors provide the comparison among SAM, hredGAN, and phredGAN. \n\nc. Table 2 compares the non-persona hredGAN with phredGAN on UDC, but the authors do not provide a comparison between these two on the TV dataset in Table 1. \n\nd. The comparison between phredGAN_a and phredGAN_d is inconsistent for the two datasets (Table 1 and Table 2).", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
