{"title": "Stability analysis for graph NNs", "review": "The paper presents in interesting and new analysis of stability of scattering transforms on graphs, when the domain (graph) is perturbed by deformations. It combines key ingredients of scattering transforms (extended here to graphs through graph diffusion wavelets), deformation of graphs (based on graph diffusion distances) and a theoretical stability analysis. Similarly to the Euclidian domain, it is shown that linear filters cannot provide representations that are simultaneously rich and stable. \n\nGenerally, the paper is pretty complete, interesting and sufficiently well presented. One might wonder if the choice of the diffusion framework for both the representation construction, and the deformation analysis, is a simplistic choice, and how similar ideas could extend to different domain deformation for example. The experiments and comparisons are also very minimal, and hard to interpret. Comparing things only with GFT and SVM is probability a 'easy' choice, with the advent of a plethora of new graph convnets architectures (GFT is probably not a 'graph baseline', as mentioned in the conclusion). \n\nThis is however an interesting work, that will likely generate exciting discussions at ICLR.
