{"title": "Sound method, but lacking a proper evaluation and comparison", "review": "This work makes use of policy gradients for fitting the parameters of a simulator in order to generate training data that results in maximum performance on real test data (e.g., for classification). The difficulty of the task rises from the non-differentiability of the simulator.\n\n# Quality\n\nThe method is sound, well-motivated, and presented with a set of reasonable experiments. However, and this is a critical weakness of the paper, no attempt is made to compare the proposed method with respect to any related work, beyond a short discussion in Section 3. The experiments do include some baselines, but they are all very weak. \n\n# Clarity\n\nThe paper is well-written and easy to follow. The method is illustrated with various experiments that either study some properties of the algorithm or show some good performance on real data.\n\n# Originality\n\nThe related work is missing important previous papers that have proposed very similar/identical algorithms for fitting simulator parameters in order to best reproduce observed data. For example,\n- https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.01118\n- https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07113\nwhich both make use of policy gradients for fitting an adversary between fake and real data (which is then used a reward signal for updating the simulator parameters).\n\n# Significance\n\nThe significance of the paper is moderate given some similar previous works. However, the significance of the method itself (regardless of previous papers) is important.\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
