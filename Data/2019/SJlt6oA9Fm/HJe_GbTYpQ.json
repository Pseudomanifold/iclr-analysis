{"title": "interesting idea, but really hard to read", "review": "This paper propose Selective Convolutional Unit (SCU), which can replace the bottleneck in Resnet block. The difference between SCU and bottleneck is that SCU adds Channel Distributor (CD) and Noise Controller (NC) to reduce and replace the channels. This paper also propose Expected channel damage score (ECDS) to measure the importance of a channel to decide weather remove or replace it. Then the experiment shows result on cifar10/100 and imagenet data set with different network architectures.\nThe idea is interesting, however, the parameter flops reduced rate seems not very impressive. The SCU seems too complicated,so I want to know that if the SCU could accelerate the forward process on modern GPU or mobile devices? \nThe result of these networks seems not the state-of-the-art, if the result can be improved, the SCU could be more convincing.\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}
