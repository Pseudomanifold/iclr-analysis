{"title": "promising idea but over-complicated method. ", "review": "The main contribution of the paper are a set of new layers for improving the 1x1 convolutions used in the bottleneck of a ResNet block. The main idea is to remove channels of low \u201cimportance\u201d and replace them by other ones which are in a similar fashion found to be important.  To this end the authors propose the so-called expected channel damage score (ECDS) which is used for channel selection. The authors have shown in their paper that the new layers improve performance mainly on CIFAR, while there\u2019s also an experiment on ImageNet\nIt looks to me that the proposed method is overly complicated. It is also described in a complicated manner.  I don't see clear motivation for re-using the same features. Also I did not understand the usefulness of applying the spatial shifting of the so-called Channel Distributor. It is also not clear whether the proposed technique is applicable to only bottleneck layers.\nThe results show some improvement but not great and over results that as far as I know are not state-of-the-art (to my knowledge the presented results on CIFAR are not state-of-the-art). The results on ImageNet also show decent but not great improvement. Moreover, the gain in reducing the model parameters is not that great as the R parameters are only a small fraction of the total model parameters. Overall, the paper presents some interesting ideas but the proposed approach seems over-complicated", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
