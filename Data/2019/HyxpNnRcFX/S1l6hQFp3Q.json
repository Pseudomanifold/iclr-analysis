{"title": "A more systematic evaluation is necessary", "review": "This paper presents a mixture of hierarchical Bayesian models for meta-learning to modulate transfer between various tasks to be learned. A non-parametric variant is also developed to capture the evolution of a task distribution over time. These are very fundamental and important problems for meta-learning. However, while the proposed model appears to be interesting, the evaluation is less convincing. \n\n1. The performance of few-shot classification on MiniImageNet is not comparable to the state of the art (Table 2, Table 1). Especially, by Table, the proposed model performs much worse than existing methods (50% vs 60%). More discussions and explanations on this experiment are clearly required.\n\n2. A more systematic and realistic evaluation is necessary to justify the proposed method. As a method that aims to cope with heterogeneous or even evolving task distributions, it is expected to work well in practice and outperform those baselines that are designed for a single task distribution.
