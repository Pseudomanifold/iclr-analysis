{"title": "Explores a good and important direction, with encouraging results", "review": "The paper takes a good step toward developing more structured representations by exploring the use of quaternions in recurrent neural networks.  The idea is motivated by the observation that in many cases there are local relationships among elements of a vector that should be explicitly represented.  This is also the idea behind capsules - to have each \"unit\" output a vector of parameters to be operated upon rather than a single number.   Here the authors show that by incorporating quaternions into the representations used by RNNs or LSTMs, one achieves better performance at speech recognition tasks using fewer parameters.\n\nThe quaternionic representation of the spectrogram chosen here seems a bit arbitrary.  Why are these the attributes to be packaged together?  its not obvious.  Shouldn't this be learned?\n\n", "rating": "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
