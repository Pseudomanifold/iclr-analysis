{"title": "Interesting task but lack of novelty", "review": "This paper focuses on novelty detection and shows that psychophysical representations can outperform VGG-encoder features in some part of this task.\n\nNovelty:\nIt is the first time I have seen this novelty detection task. This task could be part of the novelty of the paper. Another novelty comes from the new objective function they introduce.\n\nWeakness:\n1. The motivation of the new objective function is not clear to me. It seems that they first design the objective function and then build the interval-based decision function. There is not much intuition given.\n2. The experiment lacks of real data. Synthesized anomalies never exists in application. If it is a paper about application, real data is needed.\n3. The baseline is too simple. CNN could definitely beat SVM in image classification. Also using extracted features could be better than directly performing SVM on pixels.\n4. Do not see the results of OC-SVM in Table 1 even though they say they beat it.\n5. Also, I do not see any other reference work for this novelty detection problem. If it is a new problem, a clear definition of the problem is needed. If it is not, more references are needed.\n\nThe writing of the paper is clear and easy to understand. But based on all the weakness above and lack of novelty, I think the paper should be rejected for now.", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
