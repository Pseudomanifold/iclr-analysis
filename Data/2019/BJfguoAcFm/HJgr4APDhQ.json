{"title": "the method is succinct and interesting, some concerns about data and complexity ", "review": "The reviewer finds that the proposed method interesting. The model is very clean, and the implication in causal inference is significant. The writing is also clean and clear. The reviewer has several concerns:\n\n1) the algorithm seems not very scalable. In the two subproblems, there is one solved by a large number of parallel SDRs. SDR is quite expensive, and for each column in the data matrix one has to solve an SDR in each iteration. This is too much for large scale recommender systems. In fact, in the experiment 1 on MovieLens, the algorithm was only tested on a not-so-large dataset and run 5 iterations. The reviewer feels that more scenarios should be tested (e.g., more iterations, various sizes of dataset, etc.). Fixing the number of iterations also sounds a bit funny since it is more intuitive to stop the algorithm using some validation set or when the algorithm converges under a certain criterion.\n\n2) The algorithm works with *probability* of binary data. This is quite hard to estimate in practice. For example, people ``'likes'' a movie for only once. It is hard to tell what is the probability of generating this ````\"like\". It seems that the experiment part of this paper did not clearly state how to obtain the probability that the algorithm needs.\n\n3) The proposed method is a special nonnegative matrix factorization, which could be unidentifiable. How to circumvent such situation? Since identifiability of NMF affects interpretability a lot.\n ", "rating": "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
