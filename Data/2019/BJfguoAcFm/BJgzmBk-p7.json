{"title": "An interesting formulation and approach. Some concerns about pertinence and related work", "review": "The paper deals with an interesting problem. The presentation is clear the the approach intuitive.  However, the reviewer has some concerns about the pertinence of the approach and the relationship with related work.\n\nIt would be very helpful if the authors could contrast and compare the proposed approach (both qualitatively and quantitatively in their numerical experiments)  with methods for sparse non-negative matrix factorization. These would also lend themselves to causal interpretation.  \n\nThe need for modeling probabilities p_u,i in the key motivating applications is questionable. Indeed in both recommendation systems and gene expression datasets the observations are not readily in the form of probabilities. For instance in the experiments, the authors normalize the level of gene expressions to make is look as a probability, which by the way is very different from the i.id uniform setup considered in setting 1. For the movielens dataset, it is unclear how the data was preprocessed to obtain the observed p_ui.\n\n\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
