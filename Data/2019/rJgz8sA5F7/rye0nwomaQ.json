{"title": "Not good enough", "review": "The work proposes a structure that mimics progressive nets. Maybe the main difference from progressive nets is that backwards connection from the new features to the old features in layer 2 are not 0 out. This could cause interference, however is solved by using the task ID to not evaluate those new features when going back to a previous task. I think this is a technical detail, that does not provide any explicit advantage or disadvantage over progressive nets. \n\nEmploying GANs/VAE to predict task id also can be seen as not an ideal choice. In particular the GAN network will suffer from catastrophic forgetting, which is solved (if I understood correctly) by training the GAN with data from all tasks. Which makes one wonder, if we can affort to access data from all tasks to learn the GAN then why not the classification model too !?\n\nI think an alternative might be something like the Forget Me Not Process published and used in the original work with EWC.\n\nUnfortunately due to presence of these previous works, lack of more thorough comparison with other existing approaches, the work should not be accepted to ICLR.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
