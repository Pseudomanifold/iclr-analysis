{"title": "Not unknown but nice systematic exploration", "review": "I totally disagree with the authors that any of their observations are surprising. Indeed the fact that an RL agent does not generalizes to small modifications of the task (either visual or in the dynamics) is well known. If the agent should generalize though is a different question. And I do not mean this in the sense that it is an undesirable property but rather if it is outside of what \u201clearning one task\u201d means. Particularly I feel this is a very pessimistic view of RL and potentially not even in-line with what happens in supervised learning. \n\nI think one mantra of deep learning (and deep RL needs to obey by it) is that one should test in the same setting as training for things to truly work. For supervised, there is a distribution of data, and the test set are samples from the same distribution. However the testing scenario used here is slightly different. During training, if I do not see car accelerating, I think it makes no sense to expect to generalize to a new game that has this property as it is out-of-distribution. Of course it would be ideal if it could do that. And to clarify, while for us some of these extensions seem very similar and minimal changes, hence it should generalize to rather than transfer to, this is just the effect of imposing our own biases on the learning process. Deep Nets do not learn like we do, and in their universe they have never seen a car accelerating -- it makes sense that it might not to be able to generalize to it. Again, I\u2019m not arguing that we don\u2019t want this, but rather if we should expect it as part of what the system should normally generalize to.\n\nTo that end I think this paper enters in that unresolved dispute of what generalization should be versus what is transfer. At what point do we have truly a new task vs a sample from the same task. I don\u2019t think there is an answer.\n\nGoing back to the observations in this work. I think the fact that the environment is not stochastic reinforces this overfitting (as in the extreme you end up with a policy that just repeats the optimal sequence of actions). I think in this particular case I can see how finetuning to a variation of the task fails. However true stochasticity in the environment (e.g. having a distribution of variations) like is done in Distral paper (where each episode is a different layout) can behave as a regularizer that will mitigate a bit the overfitting. That is to say that I believe the observed behaviour will be less pronounced in complex stochastic setting. \n\nNevertheless the paper seems to highlight an important observation (and back it up with empirical evidence), namely we should use more regularization like L2 or otherwise in practice. Which is mostly absent from publications. And I think this on its own is valuable. \n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
