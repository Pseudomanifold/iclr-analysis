{"title": "Official review", "review": "This paper proposes an extension of deep image compression model to video compression. The performance is compared with H.264 and MPEG-4. \n\nMy main concern is the limited technical novelty and evaluation:  \n - The main idea of the architecture is extending 2D convolutions in image compression networks to 3D convolutions, and use skip connections for multi-scale modeling. The 2D to 3D extension is relatively straightforward, and multi-scale modeling is similar to techniques used in, e.g., [Rippel and Bourdev ICML 2017].  \n\n - The reconstruction loss and the entropy loss are commonly used in existing work. One new component is the \u201ctemporal consistency loss\u201d. However the impact of the loss is not analyzed in the Experiment section.\n\n - The evaluation isn\u2019t very extensive. Comparing the proposed method with state-of-the-art codecs (e.g., H.265) or other deep video compression codec (e.g., Wu et al. in ECCV 2018) would be valuable. \n\n - Since the evaluation dataset is small, evaluation on multiple datasets would make the experiments more convincing. \n\n - The evaluation is conducted in rather low-bitrate region only (MS-SSIM < 0.9), which is not common point of operation. \n\n - Finally I agree with AnonReviewer2 on limited description of evaluation details. \n\nOverall I think this paper is not ready for publication yet.", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
