{"title": "Strong, hyper-focused contribution to VQA understanding", "review": "This paper studies how the FiLM visual question answering (VQA) model answer questions involving the quantifier \u2018most\u2019. This quantifier is chosen for study because it cannot be expressed in first order logic (i.e., high-order logic is required), and secondly because there are two different algorithmic approaches to answering questions involving \u2018most\u2019 (cardinality-based strategy and pairing-based strategy). Experiments are performed by designing abstract visual scenes with controlled numerosity and spatial layouts, and applying methodologies from pyscholinguistics. The paper concludes that the model learns an approximate number system (ANS), consistent with the cardinality-based strategy, with implications for understanding the conditions under which existing VQA models should perform well or badly (and possibly for improving VQA models). \n\nStrengths:\n- The research question is clear and well-conceived. In general, it seems there are significant opportunities for better collaboration between the experimental psychology and machine learning communities, and this is a good example of the benefits.\n- The paper is clear, highly-focused, and well-written.\n\nWeaknesses:\n- The arguments for why the experimental evidence actually supports the existance of an approximate number system (ANS) could be made more clear. For example, the section on \u201cRatios andWeber fraction\u201d argues that \u201cthese curves align well with the trend predicted by Weber\u2019s law\u201d, but does not explain how the experimental data would present if the alternative hypothesis (pairing-based strategy) was being used. What would the pairing-based strategy look like in Figure 6 right? Are there not significance tests that could be used to more carefully quantify the level of support for the two alternative strategies?\n- The experiments seem very similar to Wu et al. 2018, which is considered to be prior work under the ICLR guidelines. While this paper is acknowledged in the related work, it would be helpful to expand further on the relationship between these works, so the originality and contribution of this paper can be better evaluated.\n- In some ways it is not that surprising that the CNN more easily learns an approximate number system rather than a pairing-based algorithm, as the later would presumably need to learn a different convolutional filter for every possible spatial arrangement of the pairs (which would be very sample inefficient). Therefore, it might be interesting to consider, are there any circumstances under which the CNN would learn a pairing based algorithm? For example, what if the spatial configuration of the pairs was simplified, so they were always side-by-side at a fixed distance? If pairing-based algorithms emerged under simplified scenarios, this might have implications for the design of CNN filters (if we want models that are capable of learning these types of functions).\n\nSummary:\nI regard this as a good paper, with a couple of weakness that could be addressed as indicated.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
