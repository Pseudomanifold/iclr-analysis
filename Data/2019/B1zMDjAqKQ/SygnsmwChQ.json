{"title": "unsupervised approach to learning multi sensory binding with expectation learning", "review": "The paper develops a multi sensory model that binds audio/visual features using a self-organizing binding learning layer that takes as input the latent layers of two separate auto-encoders.  The binding is learned in an unsupervised way through Hebbian learning, which is an interesting way to implement temporal binding. \n\nMy concerns are as below:\n\n- How is the accuracy computed for the experimental data? Is it done moment-by-moment (per frame of the video?)? And if so, how is the accuracy of the audio assessed, since it's sampled at a much higher frequency?\n\n- Fig 2 should be a bar graph, since each class of animal is categorical, and the accuracies should be shown with standard deviations.\n\n- Abstract is written in a very confusing way that does not make clear succinctly what are the contributions of the paper. Generally, the paper may have been assembled in some haste.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
