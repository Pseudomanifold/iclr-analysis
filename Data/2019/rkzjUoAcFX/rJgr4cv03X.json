{"title": "nice paper, publish", "review": "This paper presents an approach to customize or adapt a text-to-speech synthesis system to a new speaker, given relatively small amount of data from that speaker.  It is a very well written paper with rather strong results indicating high quality, naturalness, and similarity with real speech from a speaker can be achieved with the authors' proposed approach.  I think the paper should be accepted for presentation at the conference.\n\nFew comments:\na) In second equation in Section 2 authors state speaker identity \u201cs\u201d is part of conditioning inputs \u201ch\u201d but it is not shown in the Equation where \u201ch\u201d is replaced with \u201cl, f_0\u201d\nb) In related work, I think the speaker code work of Abdel-Hamid et al., e.g. Ossama Abdel-Hamid, Hui Jiang, \u201cFast speaker adaptation of hybrid NN/HMM model for speech recognition based on discriminative learning of speaker code,\u201d ICASSP 2013 is worth citing.\nc) The result that synthesized speech performs better than real speech in speaker verification task is interesting.  To me this points to a potential weakness in the verification methodology.  Please comment if this may be the case.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
