{"title": "Interesting Formulation/Results, Writing Can be Improved", "review": "This paper proposes an unsupervised style transfer method uses two-pathway encoder and a decoder for both domains. The loss function can be written using reconstruction losses and the confusion term. Experimental results are very promising comparing to state of the art methods. \n\nThe methodology presented in this paper is simple yet powerful according to the experimental results. However I do have a few concerns:   \n\n1. The writing can certainly be improved.  I had a difficult time understanding Section 2. For example the function Q is upper cased but later the f and g are all lower cased. Why domains A and B are defined using the space and the probability measure? \"our framework assumes that the distribution of persons with sunglasses and that of persons without them is the same,\" The \"distribution of persons\" is not a rigorous definition and is hard to infer what does it actually mean. \"f\" does not appear in the loss terms although it appears under \"min\". \n\n2. I like the simplicity of the objective function, but it is hard for me to understand that why the algorithm does not pick up spurious differences between A and B. For example, what if there are lighting differences and glasses/no-glasses differences between A and B? See 3rd row of figure 2 for an example. \n\n3. Given the huge differences in performance between the proposed method and MUNIT and DRIT, some analysis/discussion on the reason of success/failure should be given.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nI have read authors' response.
