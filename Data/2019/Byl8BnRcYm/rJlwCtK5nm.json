{"title": "The proposed CapsGNN is original and achieves good results on some datasets; Some more discussions may further help.", "review": "This paper was written with good quality and clarity. Their idea was original and experiment results show the proposed CapsGNN is effective in large graph data analysis, particularly on graphs with macroscopic properties.\n\nPros:\n\n1) The paper makes a clear and detailed comparison between the proposed CapsGNN and the related models in section 3.2.\n\n2) Use of capsules nets and routing in CapsGNN are close to that in the original CapsNet, with the core characteristics (and potential advantages) of capsules and dynamic routing being perserved in the proposed CapsGNN to handle the targeted problem. \n\n3) The comparison and model analysis are thorough and comprehensive.\n\nCons or unclear points:\n\n1) Why the paper does not include all biological datasets (6 datasets in total, only 4 used in this papaer) presented in (Verma & Zhang, 2018) in the experiment section. The experiments in Verma & Zhang, (2018) show that the GCAPS-CNN achieved SOTA results on nearly all biological datasets. Does GCAPS-CNN outperformed CapsGNN on biological datasets? It will be nice if there is comparison on more datasets and more analysis is provided between CapsGNN and GCAPS-CNN.\n\n2) Why CapsGNN is not suitable for preserving information of fine structures? Can the authors give more explanation and discussions?\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
