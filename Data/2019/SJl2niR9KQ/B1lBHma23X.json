{"title": "The paper describes the use of differentiable physics based rendering schemes to generate adversarial perturbations that are constrained by physics of image formation. The paper demonstrates how data augmentation using the scheme can improve robustness of classifiers in a limited experimental setting. ", "review": "Quality of the paper:  The paper is quite clear on the background literature on adversarial examples, physics based rendering, and the core idea of generating adversarial perturbations as a function of illumination and geometric changes.   \nOriginality and Significance: The idea of using differential renderers to produce physically consistent adversarial perturbations is novel. \nReferences: The references in the paper given its scope is fine.  It is recommended to  explore references to other recent papers that use simulation for performance enhancement in the context of transfer learning, performance characterization (e.g. veerasavarappu et al in arxiv, WACV, CVPR (2015 - 17)) \n\nPros:  Good paper , illustrates the utility of differentiable rendering and simulations to generate adversarial examples and to use them for improving robustness.\nCons: The experimental section needs to be extended and the results are limited to simulations on CIFAR-100 and evaluation on lab experimental data.  Inclusion of images showing CIFAR-100 images augmented with random lighting, adversarial lighting would have been good. The details of the image generation process for that experiment is vague and not reproducible. ", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
