{"title": "Well executed paper, however weak contributions", "review": "Update: I have read author's response (sorry for being super late). The response better indicates and brings out the contributions made in the paper, and in my opinion is a strong application paper. But as before, and in agreement with R1 I still do not see technical novelty in the paper. For an application driven conference, I think this paper will make a great contribution and will have a large impact. I am slightly unsure as to what the impact will be at ICLR. I leave this judgement call to the AC. I won't fight on the paper in either direction.\n\nThe paper studies the problem of how to refer to 3D objects with natural language. It collects a dataset for the same, by setting up a reference game between two people. It then trains speaker and listener models that learn how to describe a shape, and how to identify shapes given a discriminative referring expression. The paper seems to follows state-of-the-art in the design of these models, and investigates different choices for encoding the image / 3D shape, use if attention in the listener, and context and listener aware models.\n\nStrengths:\n1. Overall, I think this is a very well executed paper. It collects a dataset for studying the problem of interest, trains state-of-the-art models for the tasks, and conducts interesting ablations and tests insightful hypothesis.\n\nWeaknesses\n1. I am not sure what is the technical contribution being made in the paper? Contrastive referential expressions have been used to collect datasets for referring to objects in images. Use of listeners and speakers have been used in NLP (Andreas et al.) as well as in vision and language (Fried et al.). Thus, while I like the application, I am not sure if there is any novel contributions being made in the paper.\n\nOverall, this is a well executed paper, however I am not sure about the novelty of contributions made in the paper.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
