{"title": "Generally ok, but hard to gauge significance of this work", "review": "# overview\nThis paper focuses on multi-agent reinforcement learning tasks that require communication between the agents, and further presupposes that the communication protocol is bandwidth constrained and contentious so that a scheduling mechanism is necessary.  To address this they introduce a new learned weighting scheme based scheduler and distributed actor, centralized critic based architecture which is evaluated on a couple of communication driven multi-agent tasks.\n\nThe two evaluation tasks had their bandwidth artificially constrained, and SchedNet time to convergence was shown to fall somewhere between having no communication and full communication, and somewhat better than a purely round-robin based scheduling scheme, which doesn't seem particularly informative.  From this it is difficult to assess the significance of the contributions.\n\n# pros\n* communication in multi-agent scenarios is an important aspect to consider, and this work shines a spotlight on scenarios in which bandwidth is constrained.\n* general presentation fairly clear and easy to read\n\n# cons\n* Would have been more impactful to focus experiments on real-world scenarios in which bandwidth is constrained and naturally contentious\n\n# other comments\n* pg. 2 related work, suspect you meant to call out Foerster et al 2017b in second reference not Foerster et al 2017a twice.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}
