{"title": "Good applied paper appropriate for a workshop", "review": "The paper presents a coupled deep learning approach for generating realistic liquid simulation data that can be useful for real-time decision support applications. While this is a good applied paper with a large variety of experimental results, there is a significant lack of novelty from a machine learning perspective. \n\n1. The primary novelty here is in the problem formulation (e.g., defining cost function etc.) where two networks are used, one for learning appropriate deformation parameters and the other to generate the actual liquid shapes. This is an interesting idea to generate the required training data and build a generalizable model. \n\n2. But based on my understanding, this does not really explicitly incorporate the physical laws within the learning model and can't guarantee that the generated data would obey the physical laws and invariances. So, this is closer to a graphics approach and deep learning has been used before extensively in a similar manner for shape generation, shape transformation etc.    \n\n3. In terms of practical applications, to the best of my knowledge there are sophisticated physics-based and graphics based approaches that perform very fast fluid simulations. So, the authors need to provide accuracy and computation cost/time comparisons with such methods to establish the benefits of using a deep learning based surrogate model.   \n\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n\nI appreciate the rebuttals from the authors, updated my score, but I still believe (just like another reviewer) that this is better suited for a workshop or a conference like SIGGRAPH.
