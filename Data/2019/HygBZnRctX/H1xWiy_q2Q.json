{"title": "A new transfer learning method for knowledge transfer between distinct tasks ", "review": "In this paper, the authors study an important transfer learning problem, i.e., knowledge transfer between distinct tasks, which is usually called 'far transfer' (instead of 'near transfer'). Specifically, the authors propose a lightweight framework called Leap, which aims to achieve knowledge transfer 'across learning processes'. In particular, a method for meta-learning (see Algorithm 1) is developed, which focuses on minimizing 'the expected length of the path' (see the corresponding term in Eqs.(4-6)). Empirical studies on three public datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed method. Overall, the paper is well presented.\n\nSome comments/suggestions:\n(i) The details of the experiments such as parameter configurations are missing, which makes the results not easy to be reproduced.\n\n(ii) For the baseline methods used in the experiments, the authors are suggested to include more state-of-the-art transfer learning methods in order to make the results more convincing.\n\n(iii) Finally, if the authors can use some commonly used datasets in existing transfer learning works, the comparative results will be more interesting. \n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
