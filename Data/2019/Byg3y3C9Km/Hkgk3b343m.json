{"title": "Interesting idea with some weaknesses in the evaluation", "review": "This paper presents an end-to-end differentiable model (NEMO) for protein structure prediction. I found this paper very interesting and the idea of training the network through the sampling procedure promising. The authors present the challenges and techniques (damping, Lyapunov regularization etc) in detail.\n\nThe paper is clearly written, however the description of the method can be confusing. This stems in part from the many components of the network as well as the fact that the protein is represented using various coordinate systems and features, so that it is not easy to follow which applies at each stage. Fig. 6 in the appendix helps, however it would be better to have a (perhaps more concise) overview in the main text.\n\nIn the evaluation, the NEMO method is compared to a baseline approach using RNNs. While NEMO trained on profile features performs best, the baseline is trained on sequences only. However, it outperforms the NEMO model trained on sequence-only in every category. Therefore, it would be interesting to see whether NEMO outperforms a baseline trained on profile features. Otherwise, I am not certain whether I can follow the conclusion that \"NEMO generalizes more effectively\". Beyond that, it would be interesting to see some generated atomic substructures from the imputation network, in particular an analysis of how diverse the generated atom positions are and whether they depend on the local environment.\n\nOverall, I appreciate the general idea and find the proposed approach very interesting. The contribution could have been stronger with a more detailed evaluation and better presentation.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
