{"title": "review", "review": "Post-rebuttal revision: The authors have adressed my concerns sufficiently. The paper still has issues with presentation, and weak comparisons to earlier methods. However, the field is currently rapidly developing, and comparing to earlier works is often difficult. I believe the Langevin-based prediction is a significant and clever contribution. I'm raising my score to 6.\n\n------\n\nThe paper proposes an end-to-end neural architecture for learning protein structures from sequences. The problem is highly important. The method proposes to use a Langevin simulator to fold the protein \u2018in silico\u2019 from some initial state, proposes numerous tricks for the optimisation, and proposes neural networks to extract information from both the sequence and the fold state (energy function). The system works on internal coordinates, which are conditioned and integrated on the fly. The method seems to perform very well, improving upon their baseline model considerably.\n\nIn spite of the paper being an outstanding work, I have two criticisms about the accessibility and impact of the paper on the broader ICLR audience. In its current form and complexity, the paper feels accessible mostly to a narrow audience.\n\nFirst, the framework proposed in the paper is massive, containing a large amount of components, neural networks, simulators, integrators, optimisation tricks, alignments, profiles, stabilizations, etc. The amount of work done in the manuscript is staggering, but the method is also difficult to understand from reading the main manuscript alone. The 10+ page appendix is critical for understanding (for instance, the appendix reveals that MSA is used to generate more data), and even with it the method is difficult to grasp as a whole. This paper should be presented in a journal form with a presentation not hindered by page limits, while currently one needs to jump between the main text and appendix to get the whole picture. I also wonder if some parts of the system have already been published, and perhaps the presentation could be condensed that way. \n\nSecond, the introduction lists numerous competing methods both on the protein modelling side and on the MCMC vs optimisation side. The paper does not compare to any of these, which is strange, and makes it difficult to assess how much this paper improves upon state-of-the-art. Right now its unclear what is state-of-the-art in general. No bigger context of protein folding is given either, for instance, how well the method fares against purely alignment based approaches, or against purely physics-based simulators. Finally, the experimental section poorly describes how all the pieces of the system affect the final predictions. The discussion on the exploding gradients and dampening is excellent however. The only baseline is one with the simulator replaced by an RNN. There does not seem to be any running time analyses. As such, it is hard to interpret the current system, and it feels like a black box.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
