{"title": "Works well, maybe too straightforward for ICLR", "review": "This paper proposes a method for stereo reconstruction using Deep Learning. Like some previous methods, a 'cost volume' is first computed by plane sweeping, in other words the cost volume is indexed by the 2D locations in the image plane, and the disparities for 3D planes parallel to the image plane. A network then predicts the disparities for each image location from this cost volume.\n\nThe contributions with respect to the state-of-the-art are:\n\n- the cost volume is computed using differential warps, thus the network can be trained end-to-end;\n\n- a better cost volume is computed from the original cost volume and the reference image.\n\nThe results look good, both quantitatively and qualitatively. The paper reads well, and related work is correctly referenced.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with the proposed method, it makes sense and I am convinced it works well. However, I found the contributions quite straightforward, and it is difficult to get excited about the paper.\n\nMore details would be welcome for Section 3.2", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
