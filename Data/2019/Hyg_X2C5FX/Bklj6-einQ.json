{"title": "An interesting idea to visualize and explain the representation of GANs and to provide a new potential way to further improve the quality of the generated images by GANs", "review": "## Summary\nThis work proposes a novel analytic framework exploited on a semantic segmentation model to visualize GANs at unit (feature map) level. The authors show that some GAN representations can be interpreted, correlate with the parsing result from the semantic segmentation model but as variables that have a causal effect on the synthesis of semantic objects in the output. This framework could allow to detect and remove the artifacts to improve the quality of the generated images.\n\nThe paper is well-written and organized. The dissection and intervention for finding relationships between representation units and objects are simple, straightforward and meaningful. The visualizations are convincing and insightful. I recommend to accept the paper.\n\n## Detail comments\nAbout diagnosing and improving GANs, please give more details of the human annotation for the artifacts.\n\nI think there is a typo in the first and second paragraphs in section 4.3, Figure 14 -> Figure 8.  \n\nThe whole framework is based on a semantic segmentation model. The model is highly possibly imperfect and could have very different performances on different objects. Have you ever considerate to handle these imperfect models?\n\nIs there a way to apply the framework to the training process of GANs?\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
