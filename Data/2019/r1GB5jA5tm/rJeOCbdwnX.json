{"title": "GAN-based active learning for query synthesis ", "review": "This paper proposed a query-synthesis-based active learning algorithm that uses GAN to generate high entropy sample; instead of annotating the synthesized sample, the paper proposed to find the most similar unlabeled data from the pool via nearest neighbor search, with the latter is the main contribution of the paper.\n\nPros: \n(1)\tthe paper is well written and easy to follow;\n(2)\tevaluations look reasonable and fair\n\nCons:\n(1)\tThe idea of using GAN for active query synthesis isn\u2019t new. As the authors pointed out, this idea is mainly from GAAL (Zhu & Bento 2017). The main difference is sample matching that searches the nearest neighbor from pool and add the real unlabeled data for AL. So the novelty of the paper isn\u2019t significant.\n(2)\tIn terms of accuracy comparison, on Cifar-10-ten classes experiments, all ASAL variants have similar accuracies as random sampling, while traditional pool-based max-entropy clearly works much better. Although the former is much faster (O(1) vs. O(N)), this benefit is mainly due to GAAL (Zhu & Bento 2017).\n\nThe paper provides additional evidence showing that GAN-based active learning might be an interesting research direction for active query synthesis. However, given the reasons above, particularly novelty, I think the authors might need to additional work to improve the method.\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
