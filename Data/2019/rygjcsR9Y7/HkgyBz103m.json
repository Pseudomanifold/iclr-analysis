{"title": "Very nice research", "review": "This paper proposes a novel clustering technique that combines the self-organising map (SOM) (Kohonen, 1998) ideas with the differentiable quantized clustering ideas of VQ-VAE (van den Oord et al, 2017). The resulting algorithm is able to achieve better unsupervised clustering than either technique on its own. It also beats the k-means clustering approach. The authors also suggest augmenting their setup with a model of cluster transition dynamics for time-series data, which seems to improve the clustering further, as well as providing an interpretable 2D visualisation of the system's dynamics.\n\nThis approach addresses an important problem of easy interpretable visualisation of complex dynamics of a multi-dimensional system. This solution can have immediate wide spread real life applications, for example in fields like medicine or finance. The paper is very well written and the model clearly outperforms its baselines. The authors also include very nice evaluation of the importance of the different parts of the model for the final performance.\n\nThis is one of the best papers I have reviewed in a while. The only question I have is in terms of the medical data. The map learnt by SOM-VAE-prob presented in Fig. 4 appears to have 2 clusters with 'less healthy' patients (near the top left and top right edges). It would be good to have an analysis of what differences there are between these two clusters, and whether they are recovered consistently. \n\n\n", "rating": "9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
