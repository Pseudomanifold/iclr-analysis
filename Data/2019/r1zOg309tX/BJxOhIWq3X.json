{"title": "Review for \"Understanding the Effectiveness of Lipschitz-Continuity in Generative Adversarial Nets\"", "review": "The authors try to claim that Lipschitz continuity of the discriminator is a fundamental solution of GANs, and that current methods do not satisfy this approach in principle.\n\nThere are several false statements in this paper. In particular, sections 2.3 and 4.4 are wrong (and most of the paper is based on statements made there). The necessary constraint for the Wasserstein distance is NOT f(x) - f(y) <= d(x, y) for all x ~ Pr, y ~ Pg. It has to actually be 1-Lipschitz in the entire space. See Chapters 5 and 6 of [1], for example remark 6.4 or particular cases 5.16 and 5.4. Indeed, this is how it is written in all of the literature this reviewer is aware off, and it's a fact well used in the literature. Indeed, all the smoothness results for optimal transport in [1] heavily exploit the fact that the gradient of the critic is in the direction of the optimal transport map, which wouldn't be the case in the situation the authors try to claim of 'f not being defined outside of the support of Pr or Pg'.\n\nFurthermore, the relationship between Lipschitz continuity and having a gradient is elaborated in [2] https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07875 , for example figure 2 clearly show this. Furthermore, and contrary to what section 4.5 tries to claim, the idea that most conclusions of wgan hold *without* the Wasserstein distance, but with Lipschitz continuity are already elaborated in the wgan paper. See in fact, appendix G.1 [3], where this is described in detail.\n\n[1]: http://cedricvillani.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/preprint-1.pdf\n[2]: http://proceedings.mlr.press/v70/arjovsky17a/arjovsky17a.pdf\n[3]: http://proceedings.mlr.press/v70/arjovsky17a/arjovsky17a-supp.pdf", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
