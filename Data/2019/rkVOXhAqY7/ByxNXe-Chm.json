{"title": "IB with a specific choice of a parameter, but different from than VIB", "review": "This paper wants to discuss a new objective function, which the authors dub \"Conditional Entropy Bottleneck\" (CEB), motivated by learning better latent representations. However, as far as I can tell, the objective functions already exists in the one-parameter family of Information Bottleneck (IB) of Tishby, Pereira, and Bialek. The author seems to realize this in Appendix B, but calls it \"a somewhat surprising theoretical result\". However, if we express IB as max I(Z;Y) - beta I(Z;X), see (19), and then flip signs and take the max to the min, we get min beta I(Z;X) - I(Z;Y). Taking beta = 1/2, multiplying through by 2, and writing I(X;Z) - I(Y Z) = I(X;Z|Y), we find CIB. Unfortunately, I fail to see how this is surprising or different.\n\nA difference only arises when using a variational approximation to IB. The authors compare to the Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) of Alemi, Fischer, Dillon, and Murphy (arXiv:1612.00410), which requires a classifier, an encoder, and a marginal posterior over the latents. Here, instead of the marginal posterior, they learn a backwards encoder from labels to latents. This difference arises because the IB objective has two terms of opposite sign, and we can group them into positive definite terms in different ways, creating different bounds.\n\nPerhaps this grouping leads to a better variational bound? If so, that's only a point about the variational method employed by Alemi et al., and not a separate objective. As this seems to be the main contribution of the paper, this point needs to be explained more carefully and in more detail. For instance, it seems worth pointing out, in the discrete case, that the marginal posterior |Z| values to estimate, and the backwards encoder has |Z| x |Y| -- suggesting this is a possibly a much harder learning problem. If so, there should be a compelling benefit for using this approximation and not the other one.\n\nIn summary, the authors are not really clear about what they are doing and how it relates to IB. Furthermore, the need for this specific choice in IB parameter space is not made clear, nor do the experimental results giving a compelling need. (The experimental results are also not at all clearly presented or explained.) Therefore, I don't think this paper satisfies the quality, clarity, originality, or significance criteria for ICLR.", "rating": "2: Strong rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
