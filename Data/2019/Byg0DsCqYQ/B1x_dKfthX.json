{"title": "Explanation is not clear and experiments are weak", "review": "Authors propose to augment a conditional GAN model with an unsupervised branch for spanning target manifold and show better performance than the conditional GAN in natural scene generation and face generation.\n\nHowever the novelty is limited and not well explained.\n1.Similar idea of using an autoencoder as another branch to help image generation has been proposed in Ma et al.\u2019s work. \nLiqian Ma, Qianru Sun, Stamatios Georgoulis, Luc Van Gool, Bernt Schiele, Mario Fritz. Disentangled Person Image Generation, CVPR 2018.\n\n2. In the paper authors claim that skip connection makes it harder to train the longer path, which is kind of contradictory to what is commonly done in tasks of image classification, semantic segmentation and depth estimation. Can authors explain this claim?\nIn addition, it is not clear why maximizing the variance can address the challenge of training longer path.\n\n3. In Table 1, the improvement over baselines is small in case of sparse inpaint setting.\n\n4. In Figure 4, the fourth row is more blurry than the third row although with less artifacts like black dots.\n\n\n%%%%%%%% After rebuttal %%%%%%%%\n\nI appreciate authors' efforts to address my comments and am satisfied with their response. I will change decision from rejection to acceptance.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
