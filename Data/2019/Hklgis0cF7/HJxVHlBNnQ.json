{"title": "We think that this paper is not of sufficient quality to be accepted in ICLR, for at least the following reasons.", "review": "The proposed method is too simplistic, the model being succinctly described in less than one page with many errors in the given math expressions. Only the model is given. The optimization problem, as given in (1) is not explained. the authors need to stud the optimization problem, to derive its resolution, and to describe the obtained algorithm.\n\nThe authors\u2019 main motivation is to \u201cmaps the input convolutional features from the same class into tight clusters. In such a space, the clusters become compact and well-separated, \u2026\u201d. However, in the proposed method is operating in this way. The model is a simple transformation, and nothing ensures the compactness of the feature space, neither the separability of the classes.\n\nIt is difficult to understand the \u201carm CNNs with radial basis feature transformation\u201d. There are two figure in the paper that seek to show this modification of CNN, but this is not enough because nothing is said in the text, which makes these images difficult to understand. Moreover, the figures have notations different than those in the  main body, such as F_{l-1} as opposed to F_{i,j,K}.\n\nWhat is the transformation to be learned ? Is it T as given in the text before (1), or P as given in (3). In (1), it seems that it is a mix of both, namely T* = argmin_P ! Moreover, it is written \u201cTo enforce T\u2019s positive semi-definiteness, using the eigenvalue decomposition, it can be decomposed into T \u2032T\u201d.  Decomposing T as T\u2019T, means that T is very very special.\n\nEquation (4) is not correct. The summation is on i, which is not in the expressions, but in the result with F_{i,j,K}.\n\nWith the exception of Tables 3 and 4, most experiments are on comparing the conventional versus the proposed method. The authors need to compare to other methods available in the literature on defense against adversarial attacks. Moreover, it is not clear why the author compare the proposed method to ADVT (adversarial training) in Table 4, and not in Table 3.\n\nSome references are incomplete. For example, the second reference is missing the publication type, volume, \u2026 \n", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
