{"title": "meaningful work, but lacks more supporting evidences", "review": "This paper studies a very simple and intuitive method to boost the training speed of deep neural networks. The authors first train some light weighted proxy models, using these models to rank the data according to its uncertainty, and then pick the most uncertain subset to train the final model. Experiments on CIFAR10/SVHN/Amazon Review Polarity demonstrates the effectiveness.\n\nIn general, I think the authors did a decent job in showing that such a simple idea could surprisingly work well to boost NN training. I believe it will inspire future works on speeding up NN training. However, to form a solid ICLR publication, plenty of future works need to be done.\n\n1)\tI will not be fully convinced if an idea aiming to speed up, is only verified on small scale dataset (e.g., CIFAR10). It will be much better if there are large scale experiments conducted such as on ImageNet and WMT neural machine translation. \n\n2)\tPlease well position some related works. First, it would be more interesting and informative if some baselines in section 2 (especially those in \u201cOptimization and Importance Sampling\u2019), are compared with. Second, there are important related works omitted such as L2T [1], which also talks/shows the possibly of using partial training data to achieve speed up.\n\n3)\tSome writing issues: it would be better to *clearly* demonstrate the final accuracy of different models (i.e. ResNet 164 trained on whole data and selected subset), such as putting them into a table, but not merely showing them vaguely in the curves and text. I\u2019m also note sure about the meaning of `epoch\u2019 in Table 1: does it mean how many epochs the proxy model is trained? If so, I can hardly get the intuition of why smaller epochs works better. I noted a conjecture raised by the authors in the last sentence of paragraph \u201ccomparing different proxies\u201d. However, I cannot catch the exact meaning. \n\n[1] Fan, Y., Tian, F., Qin, T., Li, X. Y., & Liu, T. Y. Learning to Teach.
