{"title": "Interesting work, but need further improvement", "review": "This paper presents NMBM, a general inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) model that considers multifaceted human motivations. The authors have motivated and proposed the algorithm (Section 2 and 3), and demonstrated some experiment results based on a real-world dataset (WoWAH, Section 4).\n\n-- Originality and Quality --\n\nTo the best of my knowledge, the proposed NMBM algorithm is new. However, I feel that the derivation of this algorithm is relatively straightforward based on existing literature. Specifically, this algorithm is based on (1) Theorem 3 and (2) the linear program defined in equation 9. My understanding is that both Theorem 3 and the derivation of the linear program in equation 9 are relatively straightforward based on existing literature.\n\nOn the other hand, the experiment results in Section 4 are very strong and interesting. It is the main strength of this paper.\n\n-- Clarity --\n\nMy understanding is that the writing of Section 3 and 4 can be (and should be) further polished.\n\nSome key notations in the paper seem to be wrong:\n\n(1) In Theorem 3, how can the value function v^\\pi(s) be in the convex hull of policies? Also, e_i is not a set.\n\n(2) In equation 9, the linear program, \\eta should be another decision variable. \n\n-- Pros and Cons --\n\nPros:\n\n1) Strong experiments.\n\nCons:\n\n1) Insufficient novelty for algorithm design.\n\n2) No performance analysis for the proposed algorithm.\n\n3) Clarity needs to be further improved.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
