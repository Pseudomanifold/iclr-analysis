{"title": "Timely discussion of approaches for approximating mutual information ", "review": "This paper considers the problem of estimating bounds on the mutual information. It begins by showing that popular recent estimators (e.g. MINE) are flawed, since they rely on the Donsker-Varadhan bound that cannot be estimated efficiently. They then point to entropy upper bounds as a much more feasible approach to MI approximation, and propose a framework for using them in practice. These upper bounds converge as 1/sqrt(N) to the true entropy value, making them potentially viable in practice to obtain reasonable approximations of MI. \n\nGiven the significant recent attention payed to the MINE estimator and to MI estimation in machine learning generally, I think the message of this paper is very critical to the machine learning community. This analysis of the MINE estimator alone would warrant publication. \n\nThere are currently some weaknesses to this paper, however, when compared to the typical ICLR paper. If the following issues are addressed I am prepared to raise my scoring of this paper:\n1. Provide some intuition on how to apply this type of analysis to the continuous-valued case, or some reason why such an analysis would require a different framework. The more detail the better, if bounds analogous to Theorem 1 could be proved for continuous variables and added to the paper, that would be excellent.\n2. Section 4 as written is intuitively clear, but could greatly benefit from a full rigorous analysis. There is plenty of space in the paper to do this (and the supplement is available if needed). If such an analysis can\u2019t be done, this section should be deleted.\n3. Some empirical example of MINE converging slowly in practice would greatly add to the impact of the paper.\n\nMinor issues: \nLast sentence of Section 1 should clarify what \u201ctrue entropy\u201d means. As written it is ambiguous between the actual entropy or the cross-entropy, since both are entropies.\n\nI understand the nested optimization problem in Section 6, but the presentation is somewhat unclearly written. More exposition here would help, along with a more clear step-by-step explanation of the practical procedure.\n\nEDIT: The authors have addressed my concerns and I have raised my score.\n", "rating": "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
