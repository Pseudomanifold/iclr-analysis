{"title": "good paper", "review": "This paper presents a mixed integer programming technique for verification of piecewise linear neural networks. This work uses progressive bounds tightening approach to determine bounds for inputs to units. The authors also show that this technique speeds up the bound determination by orders of magnitude as compared to other complete and incomplete verifiers. They also compare the advercerial accuracies on MNIST and CIFAR and improve on the lower bounds as compared to PGD and upper bounds as compared to SOA. The paper is well written and presents a valuable technique for evaluating robustness of classifiers to adversarial attacks. \n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess"}
