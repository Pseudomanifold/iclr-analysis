{"title": "Novelty is limited and explanation is not clear", "review": "Authors propose to augment GAN-based image restoration with another task-specific branch such as classification tasks for further improvement.\n\nHowever, the novelty is limited and not well explained.\n1. The idea of adding a task-specific branch has been proposed in Huang et al\u2019s work.\nRui Huang, Shu Zhang, Tianyu Li, Ran He, Beyond Face Rotation: Global and Local Perception GAN for Photorealistic and Identity Preserving Frontal View Synthesis, ICCV 2017.\n\n2. It is not clear why for task-specific loss authors use mse loss instead of cross-entropy loss.\n3. It is not clear how much data is used to train the super-resolution model and whether there is overlap between training data for super-resolution task and test data for recognition task.\n4. The proposed method is not compared with other super-resolution methods.\n5. There are typos with citations. There should be parenthesis around citations.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
