{"title": "Interesting applications but limited novelty and poorly selected baseline methods. ", "review": "This paper proposed a new method for image restoration based a task-discriminator in addition to the GAN network. It shows superior performance than the baseline methods without such task-discriminator on medical image restoration and image super-resolution. While the results are better, the idea seems straightforward and has limited novelty. Please see the following comments:\n\n1. Adding an task-discriminator in a GAN network seems straightforward to improve the specific task. And this idea has already used in existing papers, e.g. Cycada.  \n\nHoffman, J., Tzeng, E., Park, T., Zhu, J.Y., Isola, P., Saenko, K., Efros, A.A. and Darrell, T., 2017.

For medical image reconstruction and image super-resolution, the proposed method was not compared with any of the state-of-the-art methods, but only with the same method without a task-discriminator as a baseline. For those tasks, there are many traditional methods and deep nets with different losses. For example, a simple L1/L2 or perceptual loss probably leads to better PSNR than the GAN loss, which is not compared at all.

For the low-dose PET dataset, the input was randomly undersampled by a factor of 100. What is the random pattern? Is it uniform? In addition, why not acquire real low-dose data and show the quality results using the proposed model? For the multi-constast MRI data, how is the input generated and what is the ground-truth? \n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
