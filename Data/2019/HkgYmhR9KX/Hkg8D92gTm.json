{"title": "Incremental contribution and unclear rationales", "review": "This work aims to address the visual active tracking problem in which the tracker is automatically adjusted to follow the target. A training mechanism in which tracker and the target serve as mutual opponents is derived to learning the active tracker. Experimental evaluation in both 2D and 3D environments is conducted.\n\nI think the contributions of this work is incremental compared with [Luo et al (2018)] in which the major difference is the partial zero sum reward structure is used and the observations and actions information from the tracker are incorporated into the target network, while the network architecture is quite similar to [Luo et al (2018)].\nIn addition, the explanation about importance of the tracker awareness to the target network seems not sufficient. The ancient Chinese proverb is not a good explanation. It would be better if some theoretical support can be provided for such design.\n\nFor active object tracking in real-world/3D environment, designing the reward function only based on the distance between the expected position and the tracked object position can not well reflect the tracker capacity. The scale changes of the target should also be considered when designing the reward function of the tracker. However, the proposed method does not consider the issue, and the evaluation using the reward function based on the position distance may not be sufficient.\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
