{"title": "This paper is an important new contribution to the field.   The results should be compared to TorusE.", "review": "The authors propose to model the relations as a rotation in the complex vector space. They show that this way one can model symmetry/antisymmetry, inversion and composition. Another contribution is the so-called self-adversarial negative sampling.\n\nPros:  The problem that they raise is important and the solution is relevant. The results considering the simplicity of the proposed model are impressive. The experiments, proof of lemmas and general overview are easy to follow, well-written and well-organized.  The improvement given the negative sampling approach is also noteworthy.\n\nCons: Nevertheless, this approach is very similar to TorusE [1], since the element-wise rotation on the complex plane is somehow related to transformation on high-dimensional Torus. Therefore, it is expected from the authors to investigate the differences between these two approaches.\n\nSuggestions:\nAlso, it is important to note the result of ablation study on Table 10 in supplementary materials, since part of the improvement does not come only from how the authors model the relation but also from the negative sampling(which could improve the results of other works as well). Maybe it is even better if Table 10 is presented in the main paper. \nAnother suggestion is to mention the negative sampling contribution also in the abstract.\n\n\n[1] Ebisu, Takuma, and Ryutaro Ichise. \"Toruse: Knowledge graph embedding on a lie group.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1711.05435 (2017).\"\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
