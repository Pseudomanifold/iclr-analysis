{"title": "The paper was not clearly written and failed to provide enough details.", "review": "The paper used the family of $L^p$-nested distributions as the prior for the code vector of VAE and demonstrate a higher MIG. The idea is adopted from independent component analysis that uses rotationally asymmetric distributions. The approach is a sort of general framework that can be combined with existing VAE models by replacing the prior. However, I think the paper can be much improved in terms of clarity and completeness.\n\n1. The authors used MIG throughout section 4. But I have no idea what it is. Does a better MIG necessarily imply a good reconstruction? I am not sure if we can quantify the model performance by the mere MIG, and suggest the authors provide results of image generations as other GAN or VAE papers do. \n2. Is the \"interpretation\" important for high dimensional code $z$? If yes, can the authors show an example of interpretable $z$?\n3. I had difficulty reading Section 4, since the authors didn't give many technical details; I don't know what the encoder, the decoder, and the specific prior are. \n4. The authors should have provided a detailed explanation of what the figures are doing and explain what the figures show. I was unable to understand the contribution without explanations.\n5. Can the authors compare the proposed prior with VampPrior [1]?\n\nThe paper should have been written more clearly before submission.\n[1] Tomczak, Jakub M., and Max Welling. \"VAE with a VampPrior.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1705.07120 (2017).", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
