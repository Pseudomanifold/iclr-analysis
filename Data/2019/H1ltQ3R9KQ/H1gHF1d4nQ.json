{"title": "Good paper on important topic", "review": "This submission is an great ablation study on the capabilities of modern reinforcement learning to discover the causal structure of a synthetic environment. The study separates cases where the agents can only observe or they can also act, showing the expected gains of active intervention.\n\nThe experiments are so far synthetic, but it would be really interesting to see how the lessons learned extend to more realistic environments. It would also be very nice to have a sequence of increasingly complex synthetic environments where causal inference is the task of interest, such that we can compare the performance of different RL algorithms in this task (the authors only used one).\n\nI would change the title to \"Causal Reasoning from Reinforcement Learning\", since \"meta-learning\" is an over-loaded term and I do not clearly see its prevalence on this submission.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
