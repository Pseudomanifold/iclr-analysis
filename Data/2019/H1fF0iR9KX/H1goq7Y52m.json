{"title": "Interesting idea but needs better illustration", "review": "The paper introduces geometry-aware filters based on constructed graphs into the standard CNN for omnidirectional image classification. Overall, the idea is interesting and the authors propose an extrinsic way to respect the underlying geometry by using tangent space projection. Understanding the graph construction and filter definition is not easy from the text description. It would be better to use a figure to illustrate them. \n\n1) How to define the size of the circular area on the tangent plane? \n\n2) Will the filter change greatly with the definition of the weight function in the neighborhood? Since the point locates on the sphere, why not using the geodesic distance instead of the Euclidean distance? \n\n3) It would be better to directly define the filter on the sphere and make it be intrinsic. The same filter on the tangent space may cover different sizes of regions on the sphere; while we prefer the filter has consistent coverage on the sphere. \n\n4) The paper misses the discussion and comparison to Anisotropic CNN (ACNN) and mixture model network (moNet). \n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
