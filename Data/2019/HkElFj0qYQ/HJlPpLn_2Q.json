{"title": "Good idea but has limited use case", "review": "This paper explores the idea of utilizing a secret random permutation in the Fourier phase domain to defense against adversarial examples. The idea is drawn from cryptography, where the random permutation is treated as a secret key that the adversarial does not have access to. This setting has practical limitations, but is plausible in theory.\n\nWhile the defense technique is certainly novel and inspired, its use case seems limited to simple datasets such as MNIST. The permuted phase component does not admit weight sharing and invariances exploited by convolutional networks, which results in severely hindered clean accuracy -- only 96% on MNIST and 45% on CIFAR-10 for a single model. While the security of a model against adversarial attacks is important, a defense should not sacrifice clean accuracy to such an extent. For this weakness, I recommend rejection but encourage the authors to continue exploring in this direction for a more suitable scheme that does not compromise clean accuracy.\n\nPros:\n- Novel defense technique against very challenging white-box attacks.\n- Sound threat model drawn from traditional security.\n- Clearly written.\n\nCons:\n- Poor clean accuracy makes the technique very impractical.\n- Insufficient baselines. While the permutation is kept as a secret, it is plausible that the adversary may attempt to learn the transformation when given enough input-output pairs. Also, the adversary may attack an ensemble of PPD models for different random permutations (i.e. expectation over random permutations). The authors should introduce an appropriate threat model and evaluate this defense against plausible attacks under that threat model.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
