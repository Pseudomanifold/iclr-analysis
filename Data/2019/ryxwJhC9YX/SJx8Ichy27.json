{"title": "Interesting idea, comparisons need to be improved", "review": "This paper proposes a well-designed instance level unsupervised image-to-image translation method which can handle the arbitrary number of instances in a permutation-invariant way. The idea is interesting and the results on various translation datasets are reasonable.  \n\nPros:\n* The proposed method process each instance separately to handle multiple instances. The summarization operation is a simple but effective way to achieve the permutation-invariant property. The context preserving loss is suitable for preserving the background information.\n* The paper is well written and easy to follow.\n\nCons:\n* My main concern is about the comparisons with CycleGAN in Figure 4 to 6. Although the CycleGAN+Seg results are shown in Figure 9 indicating that the proposed method can handle multiple instances better. I think there should also be CycleGAN+Seg results in Figure 4 to 6, since the instance segmentation is an extra information. And in my opinion, the CycleGAN+Seg can handle the situation where there are only a few instances (also can be observed in the 1st row in Figure 9). Besides, CycleGAN+Seg can naturally handle the arbitrary number of instances without extra computation cost.\n\nQuestions:\n*  I wonder what will happen if the network does not permutation-invariant. Except that the results will vary for different the input order, will the generated quality decrease? Since the order information may be useful for some applications.\n\nOverall, I think the proposed method is interesting but the comparison should be fairer in Figure 4 to 6. \n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
