{"title": "(Short) Paper is too preliminary for this venue", "review": "The idea of learning user embeddings for downstream tasks in recommender systems is a good one.\n\nHowever, this paper proposes no significant methodological developments (e.g., user2vec is an extension of item2vec obtained by transposing the observation matrix). Further, it does not present a thorough study with interesting empirical results (doc2vec does not improve performance, a single dataset is used, baselines are not state of the art).\n\nOverall, this short paper (3 pages + refs) seems a bit preliminary and, in its current state, does not make a significant enough contribution to be accepted at this venue.\n\nI would suggest that a more thorough analysis of similarity methods for NN models could be interesting to a recsys workshop or perhaps a conference focussed on recsys (e.g., ACM recsys).\n", "rating": "2: Strong rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
