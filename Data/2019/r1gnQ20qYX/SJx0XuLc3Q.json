{"title": "Interpretability insufficiently defined", "review": "This paper aims at tackling the lack of interpretability of deep learning models, which is especially problematic in a healthcare setting --the focus of this research paper. Specifically, the authors propose Prototype lEArning via Rule Lists (PEARL), which combines rule learning and prototype learning to achieve more accurate classification and better predictive power than either method independently and which the authors claim makes the task of interpretability simpler.  \nThe authors present an interesting and novel architecture in PEARL. Combining the two approaches of rule lists and prototype learning. However, my main concern with the paper and with the architecture in general is the lack of clarity upfront regarding what the authors perceive as the criteria for interpretability. This seems to be one of the chief aims of the paper, however, the authors don\u2019t reach this point until Section 4 of the paper. Given that this is one of the main strengths of the paper as proposed by the authors, this needs to be given more prominence and also needs to be made more explicit what the authors mean by this. The authors define interpretability as measured by the number of rules and number of protoypes identified by a particular model, without, providing an argument, justification, or a citation of previous work which justifies these criterion. Especially since this is one of the main points of the paper, this needs to be better argued and the authors should either elaborate on this point, or restrain on making claims that these models are more interpretable.\nThe model architecture of Section 3.1 was quite obscure both from the intuitive and implementation level. It\u2019s not clear how the different modules (prototype learning, rule lists) link together in practice, nor how these come together to create an interpretable model.\nGenerally, the paper is quite poorly structured and there were several grammatical errors which made the paper quite hard to follow. Although the problems articulated are important, the paper did not do sufficient justice to addressing these problems. \n", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
