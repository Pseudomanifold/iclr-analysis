{"title": "Possibly some interesting ideas here, but has errors, and also has a very strong assumption (that each sentence has a unique translation)", "review": "The paper gives theorems concerning \"dual learning\" - that is, making\nuse of round-trip consistency in learning of translation and other\ntasks.\n\nThere are some interesting ideas here. Unfortunately, I think there\nare issues with clarity/choice of notation and correctness (errors\nresulting from problems with the notation - or at least it's very\nhard to figure out if things are correct under some intepretation).\n\nMore specifically, I'm uneasy about the use of x^i and x^j as defined\nin section 2. In some cases x^j is a deterministic function of x^i, in\nsome cases it's a random variable, these cases are mixed. Section 2\nbecomes tangled up in this issue. It would be much better I think to\ndefine a function f_ij(x) for each (i,j) pair that maps a sentence\nx \\in S^i to its correct translation f_ij(x) \\in S^j.\n\nA critical problem with the paper is that Eq. 2 is I think incorrect.\nClearly,\n\nPr(T_ij(x_i) = f_ij(x_i), T_ji(f_ij(x_i)) = x_i)      [1]\n=\nPr(T_ij(x_i) = f_ij(x_i))                             [2]\n*\nPr(T_ji(f_ij(x_i)) = x_i) | T_ij(x_i) = f_ij(x_i))    [3]\n\nI think [1] is what is meant by the left-hand-side of Eq 2 in the paper -\nthough the use of x^j is ambiguous (this ambiguity is a real issue).\n\nIt can be verified that\n\nPr(T_ij(x_i) = f_ij(x_i)) = p_ij\n\nhowever\n\nPr(T_ji(f_ij(x_i)) = x_i) | T_ij(x_i) = f_ij(x_i)) \\neq p^r_ji\n\nThe definition of p^r_ji is that of a different quantity.\n\nThis problem unfortunately permeates the statement of theorem 1, and\nthe proof of theorem 1. It is probably fixable but without a\nsignificantly revised version of the paper a reader/reviewer is\nbasically guessing what a corrected version of the paper would\nbe. Unfortunately I think publishing the paper with errors such as\nthis would be a problem.\n\nSome other points:\n\n[1] The theorem really does have to assume that there is a unique\ncorrect translation f_ij(x^i) for each sentence x^i. Having multiple\npossible translations breaks things. The authors say in section 2 \"In\npractice, we may select a threshold BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002a)\nscore, above which the translation is considered correct\": this seems\nto imply that the results apply when multiple translations (above\na certain BLEU score) are possible. But my understanding is that this\nwill completely break the results (or at least require a significant\nmodification of the theory).\n\n[2] A further problem with ambiguity/notation is that T^d is never\nexplicitly defined. Presumably we always have T_ij^s(x^i) = T_ij(x^i) if\nT_ji(T_ij(x^i)) = x^i? That needs to be explicitly stated.\n\n[3] There may be something interesting in theorem 1 - putting aside point\n[1] above - but I am just really uneasy with this theorem and its proof\ngiven that it uses p^r_ji, and the issue with Eq. 2.\n\n[4] Another issue with the definition of p^r_ij: the notation\nP_{X^(j, r) ~ \\mu}(...) where the expression ... does not refer\nto X^{j, r} (instead it refers to x^j) is just really odd,\nand confusing.\n", "rating": "2: Strong rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
