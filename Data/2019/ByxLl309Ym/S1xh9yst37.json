{"title": "I don\u2019t quite see what is new about this paper", "review": "This paper proposes the use of unamortized Black Box Variational Inference for data imputation (given a fixed VAE with a factorized decoder), where the choice of variational distribution is a standard flow model. \n\nThe exploitation of the decoder factorization and the choice to set q(y | z) = p(y | z) was explored in the Bottleneck Conditional Density Estimation paper.\n\nTo my understanding, this paper fails to contextualize their work with the existing literature and is simply an exercise in the rote application of existing inference procedures to a well-established inference problem (data imputation). \n\nUnless the authors can convince me of the novelty of their approach or what I have overlooked in their proposal, I do not recommend this paper for acceptance.\n\nReferences:\nRanganath, et al.
