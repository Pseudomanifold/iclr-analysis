{"title": "Fast and accurate approximation to softmax, but more in-depth analysis results would be required", "review": "This paper presents an approximation to the softmax function to reduce the computational cost at inference time and the proposed approach is evaluated on language modeling and machine translation tasks. The main idea of the proposed approach is to pick a subset of the most probable outputs on which exact softmax is performed to sample top-k targets. The proposed method, namely Learning to Screen (L2S), learns jointly context vector clustering and candidate subsets in an end-to-end fashion, so that it enables to achieve competitive performance.\n\nThe authors carried out NMT experiments over the vocabulary size of 25K. It would be interesting if the authors provide a result on speed-up of L2S over full softmax with respect to the vocabulary size. Also, the performance of L2S on larger vocabularies such as 80K or 100K needs to be discussed.\n\nAny quantitative examples regarding the clustering parameters and label sets would be helpful.\nL2S is designed to learn to screen a few words, but no example of the screening part is provided in the paper.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
