{"title": "Good review, relevant recommendations for a valuable research area", "review": "This is a good review paper covering techniques proposed across many of the well-known works in this area and doing an in-depth analysis of the value each of the techniques brings. Additionally, based on these studies the paper offers insights into the best algorithms and procedures to combine to achieving good results.\n\nOne recent whitepaper that has related work (not fully overlapping though), that may be worth looking by the authors is at https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.08342. It is fairly new and not very well-known so not surprising that the authors missed it.\n\nPros\n- Well written paper with lots of in-depth experiments \n- Does well at teasing out the impact of each of the techniques and gives some intuitive explanations of why they matter.\n- Provides better insights into how to make training of binary neural networks faster.\n- As the importance of low precision networks grows, this is a valuable paper in pushing the area of research forward.\n\nCons\n- A review paper, which doesn't add much new to the existing suite of techniques. Note: This is true for most review papers.\n", "rating": "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
