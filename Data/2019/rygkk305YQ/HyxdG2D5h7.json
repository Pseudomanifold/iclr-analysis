{"title": "A good work", "review": "This paper proposes a two layer latent variable model to obtain disentangled latent representation, thus facilitates fine-grained control over various attributes including noise level, speaker rate etc.\n\nDetailed comments:\n\ni) This work is closely related to Akuzawa et al. (2018). The difference is not properly discussed. \n\nii) In the abstract, \u201cend-to-end text-to-speech\u201d is an unfortunate claim, because the proposed system has two separately trained component: 1) a text to mel-spectrogram model based on Tacotron and, 2) a WaveRNN for waveform synthesis.  In ASR, it\u2019s absolutely fine to claim a spectrogram to text model as a end-to-end system, because the wave to spectrogram step is trivial.  In TTS, waveform synthesis is a very crucial step and largely determines the final naturalness results. \n\niii) In experiment, one need include the MOS score of ground truth for comparison or debiasing.\n\niv) Did you try different values of D other than 16? When you check the meaning of different dimensions, how many dimensions are meaningful? How many are meaningless, or even just dummy?\n\nIn summary,  \npros:\n- A good work with impressive results.\ncons:\n- Related work need to be properly discussed. \n- Doesn\u2019t include the MOS of ground truth.\n- Moderate novelty.
