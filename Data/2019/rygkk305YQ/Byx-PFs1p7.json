{"title": " A structure to the z-space to create predictabilily in the features of the generated speech is implemented  with good results", "review": "The authors describe the conditioned GAN model to generate speaker conditioned Mel spectra. They augment the z-space corresponding to the identification with latent variables that allow a richer set of produced audio. In a way this is like a partially conditioned model that has \"extra\" degrees of freedom. It looks that the \"latent\" variables are just concaneted to the \"original\" set of z-values (altough with particular conditions to maximize independence). The conditioning of the z-space has originality in it and may provide interesting to the audience. Ultimately one coud think about z-space direction being totally mapped to specific features of the produced signal.\n\nAlso, I am curious to know how the Mel spectra are used to produce the actual sound wave - as the phase information is not present if utilizing only the spectral amplitude. Very often this leads to suboptimal generation, and the remedy is to use the time domain like in ( https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1810/1810.05319.pdf).  However, in this case the audio samples show a pretty nice generation of sound.  However, it is not really end to end.\n\nThe manuscript has some curious decisios in its concepts - I do not see the architecture really hiearchial, nor end to end. I would prefer modifications on the paper that concentrate on the truly novel features. \n\nThe paper is clear, well written and done with high ambition, from data set utilization  to novel architetures to human quality panels. Results are good and interesting.\n\nNEW:\nThe authors have addressed the concerns I had with the manuscript.\n\n\n\n", "rating": "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
