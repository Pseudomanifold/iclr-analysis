{"title": "Interesting idea", "review": "The paper proposed an interesting algorithm and direction, which tries fill the gap of NN in tabular data learning. My concern is, given this is an empirical work,  the number of datasets used in evolution is a bit small. \n\nAlso, xgboost was the winning algorithm for many competitions for tabular data, would be good to compare the NN with properly optimised xgboost. \n\nIn chapter 2, related work. The authors state that \"tree-based models still yield two obvious shortages: (1) Hard to be integrated into complex end-to-end frameworks... (2) Hard to learn from streaming data. \n\nTo me these two reasoning statements are not particularly convincing. One could also say:\n\nNN models yield two obvious shortages: (1) Hard to be integrated into complex end-to-end frameworks... (2) Hard to learn from streaming data...\n\nActually, tree ensemble based algorithms, eg Hoeffding tree ensembles, are among the best performed algorithms for data streaming tasks.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}
