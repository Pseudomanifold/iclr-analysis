{"title": "Interesting idea but not convincing", "review": "This paper presents a novel concept of supervised learning, advocacy learning. In this framework, supervised learning procedure is given by two subnetworks, advocates and judge. Advocates generate evidence in the form of attention for individual classes and judge decide the final class labels.\n\nThe main idea looks interesting, and the paper is clear enough to deliver the idea. However, this paper has the following major issues.\n\n1. There is no formal justification of the idea. Although the idea looks interesting, there is no theoretical background and no clear intuition.\n\n2. Experiment is weak and even inconsistent. Evaluation is performed on very small datasets only, where all baseline methods already show very high accuracy and accuracy gain given by the proposed method is very marginal. In particular, Table 1 and 2  have inconsistent results; advocacy network is better in Table 1 while worse in Table 2 compared to honest advocacy network. To make the idea more convincing, it is required to test it on much larger datasets, at least ImageNet scale, and more desirable to show results in other tasks such as object detection and image segmentation.\n\n3. I am not sure if advocacy network has any separate supervision to enforce it to be learned in a class-conditional manner. Also, in honest advocacy network, each subnetwork can look at only a part of dataset (data corresponding to the class), and I wonder if there is any problem given by data deficiency issue.\n\nOverall, the paper does not look ready for publication because the idea is clearly justified neither theoretically nor empirically.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
