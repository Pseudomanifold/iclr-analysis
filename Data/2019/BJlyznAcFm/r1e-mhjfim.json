{"title": "Adversarial Lawyers an interesting idea for a deep learning architecture ", "review": "This  seems like a very interesting concept, creating adversarial agents for each class that essentially compete with each other.  It seems like this might be a very promising method for arguing for even more abstract classes like \"circus\" vs \"zoo\" \n\nI wise more had been said about why the Honest Advocate outperformed the standard Advocate on the MIMIC dataset.  \n\nThe authors state:\n\n\"Advocates can effectively compete to generate higher quality evidence, though this effect was\nlargely localized to a few class-pairs (e.g. shirts v.s. pullovers). \"\n\nDoes it do this on things that are essentially very similar?  \n\nOverall, I think this is a great idea. I have been looking for some similar work and consider this work to be similar in the multi-generative aspect: \"MEGAN: Mixture of Experts of Generative Adversarial Networks for Multi-modal Image Generation\" - Park, Yoo, Bahng, Choo and Park, IJCAI 2018, but I cannot find similar work using the generative experts as collective adversaries for discrimination.\n\nThe paper is clear and well written.  Improvements for the paper would be going into more detail about why the method works.  It would have been great to have seen a data set on which the method performs poorly - that would give additional insight into its strengths and weaknesses.\n\n", "rating": "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}
