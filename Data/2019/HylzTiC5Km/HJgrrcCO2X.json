{"title": "A new version of PixelCNN-based model for HQ images", "review": "General:\nThe paper tackles a problem of learning long-range dependencies in images in order to obtain high fidelity images. The authors propose to use a specific architecture that utilizes three main components: (i) a decoder for sliced small images, (ii) a size-upscaling decoder for large image generation, (iii) a depth-upscaling decoder for generating high-res image. The main idea of the approach is slicing a high-res original image and a new factorization of the joint distribution over pixels. In this model various well-known blocks are used like 1D Transformer and Gated PixelCNN. The obtained results are impressive, the generated images are large and contain realistic details.\n\nIn my opinion the paper would be interesting for the ICLR audience.\n\nPros:\n+ The paper is very technical but well-written.\n+ The obtained results constitute new state-of-the-art on HQ image datasets.\n+ Modeling long-range dependencies among pixels is definitely one of the most important topics in image modeling. The proposed approach is a very interesting step towards this direction.\n\nCons:\n- The authors claim that the proposed approach is more memory efficient than other methods. However, I wonder how many parameters the proposed approach requires comparing to others. It would be highly beneficial to have an additional column in Table 1 that would contain number of parameters for each model.\n- All samples are take either at an extremely high temperature (i.e., 0.99) or at the temperature equal 1. How do the samples look for smaller temperatures? Sampling at very high temperature is a nice trick for generating nicely looking images, however, it could hide typical problems of generative models (e.g., see Rezende & Viola, \u201cTaming VAEs\u201d, 2018).\n\n--REVISION--\nI would like to thank the authors for their response. I highly appreciate their clear explanation of both issues raised by me. I am especially thankful for the second point (about the temperature) because indeed I interpreted it as in the GLOW paper. Since both my concerns have been answered, I decided to raise the final score (+2).", "rating": "9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
