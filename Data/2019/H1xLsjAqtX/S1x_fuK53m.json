{"title": "Interesting idea, more experiments needed", "review": "This paper proposes a framework for fast text classification that relies on a text selector and classifier that are jointly optimized using an aggregation scheme for the output of the text selector. This has an interesting application in cases where the text selector has to be implemented in a low performance device and the classification can be done on the cloud. The approach the authors take is interesting and different from what has done before, however I believe some further details / tests are needed to make this paper more convincing.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem like the model has a clear advantage over existing methods. The advantage of the method could be brought up by comparing other complexity metrics such as how many words need to be transmitted (this is shown in figure 2 but not in relation to other approaches), what is a possible other advantage over the skim-RNNs etc. The interpretability of the results is encouraging and perhaps this could be explored more and leveraged as an advantage.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
