{"title": "Interesting Idea, Unclear Writing", "review": "A method for learning physics priors is proposed for faster learning and better transfer learning. The key idea in learning physics priors using spatial net, which is similar to a convolutional LSTM model for making predictions. Authors propose to improve the sample efficiency of Deep RL algorithms, by augmenting PPO\u2019s state input with 3 future frames predicted by the physics prior model. \n\nAuthors show that using Spatial-Net leads to better prediction of the future as compared to previous methods on simple simulated physics environment and can be incorporated to improve performance on ATARI games. \n\n(a) I am a bit unclear on how Spatial-Net is trained along with the policy in the IPA architecture. In section 5.1 it is mentioned that, \u201cWe train both SpatialNet and the policy simultaneously and use Proximal Policy optimization (PPO) as our model free algorithm\u201d, however earlier in Section 3 it is mentioned that first the agent is pre-trained with prediction and then the pre-trained model is used with the RL algorithm. Can the authors clarify the training procedure? Is it the case that the Spatial-Net is first pre-trained with some data and then fine-tuned along with the environment rewards? Do the policy-net and the frame prediction net share any parameters? \n\n(b) Is the comparison in Table 2/Figure 5 fair in terms of number of frames seen by the agent? Let a PPO agent see N frames? How many frames does the IPA agent say (both for training spatial Net + Policy). \n\n(c) How about baselines, where instead of augmenting PPO with any additional frames, the Policy is initialized with weights learned by Spatial Net? Other baseline is to jointly optimize for future frame prediction + environment reward (in this case atleast some parameters between the spatial net and the policy net will be shared), but without augmenting the input state with future predicted frames? \n\nThe Spatial net architecture is similar to convolutional LSTM \u2014 and I therefore don\u2019t think that is a significantly novel technical contribution. The application of spatial net to augment frames in the state is although novel in my best knowledge. The above questions will help me understand the experiments better. Right now the method is slightly unclear to me and the results on ATARI (figure 11) are a bit underwhelming. Also, why did the authors chose the specific ATARI games that they reported results on \u2014 why not other games too?
