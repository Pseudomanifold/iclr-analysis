{"title": "Proposal of N-ball embedding for tree structures", "review": "This paper proposes N-ball embedding for taxonomic data. An N-ball is a pair of a centroid vector and the radius from the center, which represents a word.\n\nMajor comments:\n\n- The weakness of this paper is lack of experimental comparisons with other prominent studies. The Poincare embedding and the Lorentz model are recently proposed and show a good predictive performance in hypernymy embedding.\n- WordNet concepts are actually structed in DAG. Recent studies on structure embedding can hadle DAG data. It is not clear how to extend N-ball embedding for handling DAT structures. \n\n- Related work is not sufficiently described.\n\n- It is not clear why N-ball embedding is suitable for hierarchical structures.\n", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
