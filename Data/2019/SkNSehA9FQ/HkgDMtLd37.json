{"title": "A subword embedding model for codes. What's new?", "review": "The paper introduces a new way to use a subword embedding model 2 tasks related to codes: fill-in-blank and variable naming. \n\n* pros: \n- the paper is very well written. \n- the model is easily to reimplement. \n- the experiments are solid and the results are convincing. \n\n* cons: \n- the title is very misleading. In fact, what the paper does is to use a very shallow subword embedding method for names. This approach is widely used in NLP, especially in machine translation. \n- the work is progressing, meaning that most of it is based on another work (i.e. Allamanis et al 2018). \n\n* questions: \n- how to build the (subword) vocabulary? \n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
