{"title": "Good but generic model, contribution limited ", "review": "\nThis paper proposes a VAE for modelling state-action sequences using a single latent variable rather than one per timestep. The authors empirically demonstrate that this model works on toy 2D examples and a simplified 2D Minecraft-like environment. Although I am unaware of other works that use a VAE in this setting, the model is still quite generic, thus requires further application to justify its significance. This paper is clear and well written. \n\nThe current contribution of this paper is limited, however it could be improved in a number of ways. The main component lacking from this paper is a meaningful comparison to other related works. Its unclear what the advantage of this model is over other models and so a thorough comparison to other sequence models would really help this paper. As mentioned in the conclusion, another direction for this work would be to bootstrap reinforcement learning. If this bootrapping was demonstrated then it would make this paper\u2019s contribution stronger. Finally, another important direction for improvement for this paper would be to demonstrate its usefulness on more complex environments, instead of only 2D examples. \n\nPros:\n- clear and well written\n- model works on toy examples\nCons:\n- lack of baseline comparisons\n- lack of contributions\n\n\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
