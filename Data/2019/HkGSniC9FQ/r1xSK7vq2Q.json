{"title": "The result seems straight forward", "review": "This paper studies composite neural network performance from function composition perspective. In theorems 1, 2 and 3, the authors essentially prove that as the basis functions (pre trained components) increases (satisfying LIC condition), there are more vectors/objects can be represented by the basis. \n\nTo me, this is a very straight forward result. As the basis increases while the LIC condition is satisfied, we can of course represent more objects (the new component is one of them). I don't see any novelties here. The result is straightforward, and this should be a clear rejection.\n\n", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
