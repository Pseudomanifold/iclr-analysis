{"title": "Review", "review": "The paper considers the problem of building a composite network from several pre-trained networks and whether it is possible to ensure that the final output has better accuracy than any of its components. \n\nThe analysis done in the paper is that of a simple linear mixture of the outputs produced by each component and then by showing that if the output of the components are linearly independent then you can find essentially a better ensemble. This is a natural and straightforward statement with a straightforward proof. It is unclear to me what theoretical value does the analysis of the paper add. Further the linear independence assumption in the paper seems very strong to make the results of value. \n\nFurther the paper seems very hastily written with inconsistent notation throughout making the paper very hard to read. Especially the superscript and the subscript on x have been jumbled up throughout the paper. I recommend rejection and encourage the authors to first clean up notation to make it readable.
