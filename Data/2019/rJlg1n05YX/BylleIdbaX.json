{"title": "Interesting topic but the paper is not well explained", "review": "This paper addressed an interesting problem of reducing the kernel to achieve CNN models, which is important and attracts lots of research work. However, the methods don't have very good justifications. \nFor example, in Section 3.1, the authors mentioned that \"Specifically, in normal CNNs it is quite common to have multiple stages/blocks which contain repeated patterns such as layers or structures.\" It is still unclear why it is better to replace these so-called repeated patterns. \nThe defined \"information field\" is not clearly explained and the benefits are also not demonstrated.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
