{"title": "Nice and novel idea", "review": "This paper proposes the temporal difference variational auto-encoder framework, a sequential general model following the intuition of temporal difference learning in reinforcement learning. The idea is nice and novel, and I vote for acceptance.\n1. The introduction of belief state in the sequential model is smart. How incorporate such technique in such an autoregressive model is not easy.\n2. Fig 1 clearly explained the VAE process.\n3. Four experiments demonstrated the main advantages of the proposed framework, including the effectiveness of proposed belief state construction and ability to jumpy rolling-out, \n\n\nOther Comments and Questions:\n1. Typo, p(s_{t_2}|s_{t_1}) in the caption of Fig 1.\n2. Can this framework partially solve the exposure bias?\n3. The author used uniform distribution for t_2 - t1, and from the ``NOISY HARMONIC OSCILLATOR`` we can indeed see larger interval will result in worse performance. However, the author also mentioned other distortion could be investigated, so I am wondering if the larger probability mass is put on larger dt, what the performance will become.\n4. The code should be released. I think that it is a fundamental framework deserving further development  by other researchers.", "rating": "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
