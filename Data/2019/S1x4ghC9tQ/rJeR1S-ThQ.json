{"title": "Very strong", "review": "The authors propose TD-VAE to solve an important problem in agent learning, simulating the future by doing jumpy-rollouts in abstract states with uncertainty. The authors first formulate the sequential TD-VAE and then generalize it for jumpy rollouts. The proposed method is well evaluated for four tasks including high dimensional complex task.\n\nPros.\n- Advancing a significant problem\n- Principled and quite original modeling based on variational inference\n- Rigorous experiments including complex high dimensional experiments\n- Clear and intuitive explanation (but can be improved further)\n\nCons. \n- Some details on the experiments are missing (due to page limit). It would be great to include these in the Appendix. \n- It is a complex model. For reproducibility, detail specification on the hyperparameters and architecture will be helpful.\n\nMinor comments\n- Why q(z_{t-1}|z_t, b_{t-1}, b_t) depends both  b_{t-1}, b_t, not only b_t?\n- The original model does not take the jump interval as input. Then, it is not clear how the jump interval is determined in p(z\u2019|z)?\n", "rating": "9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
