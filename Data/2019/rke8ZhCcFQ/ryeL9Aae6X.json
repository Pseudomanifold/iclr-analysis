{"title": "Should be supported with stronger experiments and be more clearly presented", "review": "This paper presents an idea of adding fake nodes to attack a graph network model, by a GAN style trainning procedure.\n\nHowever I concern about the experimental parts, which are only evaluated on small settings. \n\nPlus, the notations are inconsistant, whereas the objective function in (3) has nothing to do with $X_{fake}$. I tend to believe that this should be a typo.\n\nThe greedy optimization should generally be highly costed, although it works well for learning sparse representation in previous literature, however, in the graph setting, I am not sure that this is a good fit for $O(|V|^2)$ variables. Perhaps the author need to argue why this is efficient, or to propose other methods.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
