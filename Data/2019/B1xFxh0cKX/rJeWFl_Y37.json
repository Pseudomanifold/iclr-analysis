{"title": "Interesting idea, but not really new", "review": "The idea of this paper is to accelerate the OpenAI type evolution strategy by introducing\n1. non-isotropic distribution, where the covariance matrix is of form I + UU^t; and\n2. external information such as a surrogate gradient to determine U.\nThe experiments show promising results. I think it is the right direction to go, however at the same time, these ideas are not really new. \n\nThe first point is well studied in the context of evolution strategies in e.g., (Sun et al., arxiv 2011), (Loshchilov, Evolutionary Computation 2015), (Akimoto et al, GECCO 2016). They all have covariance matrix of form I + UU^t or a bit richer. There are mainly two advantages over full CMA-ES or NES: 1) computationally cheap, and 2) faster adaptation of the covariance matrix. The current paper does not adapt the covariance matrix and use an external information to guide the distribution. Therefore, it is different from the above work, but I suggest to compare Guided ES with these methods to see the effect of external information purely.  \n\nThe second point, using external information to change the distribution shape, is also investigated in reference (Hansen, INRIA TechRep 2011), where external information such as a good point or a good directions (gradient) is injected in order to adapt the covariance matrix. \n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
