{"title": "Nice alternative to backprop", "review": "In the submitted manuscript, the authors compare the performance of sign-symmetry and feedback alignment on ImageNet and MS COCO datasets using different network architectures, with the aim of testing biologically-plausible learning algorithms alternative to the more artificial backpropagation.\nThe obtained results are promising and quite different to those in (Bartunov , 2018) and lead to the conclusion that biologically plausible learning algorithms in general and sign- symmetry in particular are effective alternatives for ANN training.\n\nAlthough all the included ideas are not fully novel, the manuscript shows a relevant originality, paving the way for what can be a major breakthrough in deep learning theory and practice in the next few years. The paper is well written and organised, with the tackled problem well framed into the context. The suite of experiments is broad and diverse and overall convincing, even if the performances are not striking. Very interesting the biological interpretation and the proposal for the construction in the brain.\nA couple of remarks: I would be interested in understanding the robustness of the sign-symmetry algorithm w.r.t. for instance dropout and (mini)batch size, and to see the behaviour of the algorithm on datasets with small sample size; second, there is probably too much stress on comparing w/ (Bartunov , 2018), while the manuscript is robust enough not to need such motivation.\n\nMinor: refs are not homogeneous, first names citations are not consistent.", "rating": "9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
