{"title": "Interesting and well-written paper", "review": "The paper presents a study on orientation selectivity in DNNs for image classification, arguing that this type of selectivity in the lower layers is crucial for generalization. This hypothesis is tested through an ablation study, which the authors interpret as a suggestion of the existence of a causal relation.\n\nThe authors tackle a very interesting problem that seems to have not received yet enough attention. The paper is quite well-written and clear, making it understandable also to non-experts. The only concern I would have is about the causal claims in Section 3.4. I\u2019m not completely sure the ablation experiments are the correct way to \u201cprove\u201d causality, as opposed to somehow trying to intervene on the orientation selectivity directly. On the other hand, this seems complicated to prove and the approach proposed in the paper seems a pragmatic solution. I would possibly hedge slightly the causal claims.\n\nFrom an outsider point of view, I think the paper provides an interesting contribution to the discussion on orientation selectivity. I particularly appreciated its clarity and reproducibility.\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}
