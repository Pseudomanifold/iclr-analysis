{"title": "Non convincing experiments   ", "review": "The paper proposes a meta algorithm to train a network with noisy labels.\nIt is not a general algorithm but a simple modification of two proposed methods.  It is presented as a heuristics and it  would be helpful to derive a theoretical framework or motivation for the proposed algorithm. \n\nMy main concern is related to the experiment results. The results of the baseline method look strange. Why there is a strong decrease in the MNIST test accuracy after 20 epochs? Standard training of neural network is very robust to label noise.  In case of  20% symmetric error  (figure 2c)  the performance degradation using standard training should be very small. \nHence it is difficult to evaluate to performance of the proposed method.\nAt the beginning of the experiment section you mentioned several algorithms   for training with noisy labels.  I expect to compare your results to at least one of them. \n    \n", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
