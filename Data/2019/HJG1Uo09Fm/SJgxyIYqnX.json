{"title": "Lack of clarity in core sections", "review": "This paper describes a meta-RL algorithm through imitation on RL policies. While the paper builds nicely up to the core part, I find essential details missing about the imitation setup. By glancing at previous BC papers (some of which are cited), the quantity for supervised imitations, etc., were clearly defined. \n\nIt will be useful for this reviewer if the authors can provide more clarity in explaining the BC task involved in their algorithm.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}
