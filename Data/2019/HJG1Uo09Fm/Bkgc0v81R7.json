{"title": "Lack of details and reproducibility", "review": "The paper presents a meta-RL method extends previous work on meta-RL by including an imitation learning step. It is mentioned that the behaviour closing part of this extended algorithm can come from a teacher or some other source. Since this extension is the major contribution, it must be discussed in more detail. I also don't understand why \n\nMy second problem with the paper is reproducibility. The purpose of OpenAI is comparability and reproducibility of algorithms. It is not sufficient to simply state that you have used TensorFlow. We need information about the architecture, etc so that the results can be reproduced. Also, since you use OpenAI, the score for each experiment should be compared to the best scores known from the website so that the performance of the new algorithm can be compared to others.", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}
