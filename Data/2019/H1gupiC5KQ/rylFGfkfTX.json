{"title": "Not enough novelty", "review": "This paper proposes a cute idea as suggesting ensembles of Q-function approximations rather than a singular DQN. \n\nHowever, at the core of it, this boils down to previously studied methods in the literature, one of which also is not cited here: \n\n@inproceedings{osband2016deep,\n  title={Deep exploration via bootstrapped DQN},\n  author={Osband, Ian and Blundell, Charles and Pritzel, Alexander and Van Roy, Benjamin},\n  booktitle={Advances in neural information processing systems},\n  pages={4026--4034},\n  year={2016}\n}\n\nExperiments provided in this paper compares with only the weak baseline of single DQN, however, it fails to compare other similar ideas in the literature such as the above paper. Hence, this paper lacks enough novelty for publication, and it is not clear from the experiments that the specific method proposed in this paper is better than others in the SOTA.
