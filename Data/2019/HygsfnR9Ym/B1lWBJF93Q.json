{"title": "Review", "review": "This paper nicely proposes a back-tracking model that predicts the trajectories that may lead to high-value states. The proposed approach was shown to be effective in improving sample efficiency for a number of environments and tasks.\n\nThis paper looks solid to me, well-written motivation with theoretical interpretations, although I am not an expert in RL.\n\nComments / questions:\n- how does the backtracking model correspond to a forward-model? And it doesn't seem to be contradictory to me that the two can work together.\n- could the authors give a bit more explanation on why the backtracking model and the policy are trained jointly? Would it still work if to train the backtracking model offline by, say, watching demonstration?\n\nOverall this looks like a nice paper.
