{"title": "Limited novelty, nice write-up, impressive results, little/no analysis", "review": "My main reservation with this paper is the limited novelty. The approach seems to be a rather direct application of a subset of the sluice network architecture in [0]\u00a0- which has been available on ArXiV since 2017 - with MUSE pre-trained embeddings. In particular, I don\u2019t think the claim that the authors \u201cpropose the first zero-resource multilingual transfer learning model\u201d is necessary - and I think it is way too strong a claim. Training an LSTM on English data with MUSE/vecmap embeddings is pretty standard by now, and this does not require any target language training data or cross-lingual supervision either. See zero-shot scenarios in [1-2], for example.\n\nApart from that, I think the write-up is nice, the approach makes a lot of sense, and results are impressive. I would have liked to see a bit more analysis. In particular, the fact that you learn gate values, makes it easy to analyze/visualize what and how your networks learn to share. \n\nI think there\u2019s a few baselines in between BWE and MAN, e.g., simple adversarial training and adversarial training with GradNorm [3], that would put your results in perspective. Finally, I would like to encourage the authors to run experiments with actual low-resource languages: A literature on cross-lingual transfer experimenting with German, Spanish, and Japanese, could end up being very heavily biased. For tasks with data in more languages, consider, for example, POS tagging [4], morphological analysis [5], or machine translation [6]. \n\n[0] https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08142\n[1] http://aclweb.org/anthology/P18-1074\t\n[2]\u00a0http://aclweb.org/anthology/P18-2063\n[3] https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.02257\n[4] http://universaldependencies.org/\n[5] http://unimorph.org/\n[6]\u00a0http://christos-c.com/bible/", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
