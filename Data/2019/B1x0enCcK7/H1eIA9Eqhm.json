{"title": "Cool idea, but not well written, and not sufficiently evaluated", "review": "This paper presents a method for generating 3D objects. They train a VAE to generate voxel occupancy grids. Then, they allow a user to generate novel shapes using the learned model by combining latent codes from existing examples. \n\nPros:\n- The idea of linking affordances to 3D object generation is interesting, and relevant to the machine learning and computer vision communities.\n\n- They propose to evaluate the quality of the shape based on a physical simulation (Section 4.4.3), which is an interesting idea.\n\nCons:\n- This paper is not well written. The method is described in too much detail, and the extra length (10 pages) is unnecessary. Cross entropy, VAEs, and many of the CNN details can usually just be cited, instead of being described to the reader.\n\n- The paper uses suggestive terminology, like \"functional essence\" and \"functional arithmetic\" for concepts that are fairly mundane (see Lipton and Steinhardt, 2018 for an extended discussion of this issue). For example, the \"functional essence\" of a class is essentially an average of the VAE latent vectors (Section 3.3.1). The paper claims, without sufficient explanation, that this is computation is motivated by the idea that \"form follows function\".\n\n- The results are not very impressive. There is no rigorous evaluation. They propose several nice metrics to use (eg. affordance simulation), but the results they present for each metric are quite limited. The qualitative results are also not particularly compelling.\n\n- The paper should more thoroughly evaluate the importance weighting that is described in Section 3.3.2.\n\n - The technical approach (combining VAE vectors to make new shapes) is not particularly novel[\n\nOverall:\n\nThe paper should not be accepted in its current form, both due to the confusing writing, and the lack of careful evaluation.\n", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
