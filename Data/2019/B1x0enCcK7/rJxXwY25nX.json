{"title": "An ad-hoc method for shape generation", "review": "\nThis paper proposed a 3D shape generation model. The model is essentially an auto-encoder. The authors explored a new way of interpolation among encoded latent vectors, and drew connections to object functionality.\n\nThe paper is, unfortunately, clearly below the bar of ICLR in many ways. It\u2019s technically incremental: the paper doesn\u2019t propose a new model; it instead suggests new way of interpolating the latent vectors for shape generation. The incremental technical innovation is not well-motivated or justified, either: the definitions of new concepts such as \u2018functional essence\u2019 and \u2018importance vector\u2019 are ad-hoc. The results are poor, much worse compared with the state-of-the-art shape synthesis methods. The writing and organization can also be improved. For example, the main idea should be emphasized first in the method section, and the detailed network architecture can be saved for a separate subsection or supplementary material. \n\nIt\u2019s good that the authors are looking into the direction of modeling shape functionality. This is an importance area that is currently less explored. I suggest the authors look into the rich literature of geometry modeling in the computer graphics and vision community, and improve the paper by drawing inspiration from the latest progress there. \n", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
