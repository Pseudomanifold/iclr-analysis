{"title": "Weak evaluation", "review": "The paper studies the credit assignment problem in multi-agent domain (soccer playing as a concrete application). The paper itself is well-written. I hope that the author could use a better methodology to make the evaluation part stronger.\n\nI have a few questions to the author:\n\n1. Why features like which team has ball possession (a boolean) is represented as a channel in the image? What if you concatenate this bit with the output of the last layer of convolution?\n\n2. Compared to the proposed algorithm, the evaluation part is somewhat weaker. \n i) I understand that it might be hard to get ground truth of the credit assignment, but is there any way to get a more competitive baseline model.\nii) the dataset you used only contains 6 games from the same team in one tournament.  This seems biased and not a reliable dataset itself.\n\nMinor typos:\n* section 4. We extract all episodes of open play (where) one team", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
