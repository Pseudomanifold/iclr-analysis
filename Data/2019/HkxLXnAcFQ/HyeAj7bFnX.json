{"title": "Conclusion is a bit confusing", "review": "The paper tried to propose a systematic/consistent way for evaluating meta-learning algorithms. I believe this is a great direction of research as the meta-learning community is growing quickly. However, my question is if a relatively simple modification could improve the baselines, are there simple modifications available to other meta-learning algorithms being investigated? If the other algorithms are not as good as they claimed, can you give any insights on why and what to improve?", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}
