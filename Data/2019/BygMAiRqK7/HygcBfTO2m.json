{"title": "Interesting idea, but need more polishing", "review": "\n1. The assumption made by the authors that \"generator is injective\" is problematic or even wrong, as it is well known that GAN suffers from mode collapsing problem. \n\n2. It is very confusing when the authors mentioned the negative Shannon entropy. Because the equation the authors wrote is the Shannon entropy, not the negative version.\n\n3. In the 5th paragraph in the  introduction section, the paper (Cuturi, 2013) has nothing to do with \"improve computational aspect of GAN\", maybe the authors want to cite this paper \"Learning Generative Models with Sinkhorn Divergences\".\n\n4. The authors failed to discuss their paper with \"ON THE QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF DECODERBASED GENERATIVE MODELS\", which uses AIS to estimate the likelihood.\n\nSuggestion:\n1. Please use \\cdot instead of , i.e. F(\\cdot) instead of F(.)\n2.
