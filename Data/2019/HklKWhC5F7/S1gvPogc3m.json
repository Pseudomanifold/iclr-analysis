{"title": "Empirical study of variation of accuracy and robustness of networks versus training data size", "review": "The paper presents an empirical study of how accuracy and robustness vary with increasing training data for four different data sets and CNN architectures. The main conclusion of the study is that while training accuracy generally increases with increasing training data, provided sufficient training data is available for training the network in the first place, the robustness on the other hand does not necessarily increase, and may even decrease.\n\nSimilar findings were presented previously in Su et al., 2018. Hence, the current paper contains incremental and marginal new findings versus the existing literature. The paper would also have been a lot stronger and significantly advanced our scientific understanding of the problem if the authors had made some attempt at trying to explain their findings theoretically. In its current form the paper does not contain sufficient contributions for acceptance.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
