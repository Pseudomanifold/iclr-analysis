{"title": "An empirical study of the influence of training data size on model robustness ", "review": "This paper conducts an empirical analysis of the effect of training data size on the model robustness to adversarial examples. The authors compared four different NN architectures using four different datasets for the task of image classification. Overall, the paper is easy to follow and clearly written. \n\nHowever, since Su et al., 2018, already presented similar findings, I do not see any major contribution in this paper. Additionally, I would expect the authors to conduct some more analysis of their results besides acc. and distortion levels. For examples, investigate the type of mistakes the models have made, compare models with the same test acc. but different amount of training data used to get there, some analysis/experiments to explain these findings (monitor models parameters/grads during training, etc.) \n\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
