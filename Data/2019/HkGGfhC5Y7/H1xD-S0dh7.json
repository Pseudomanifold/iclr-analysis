{"title": " Training procedure for VQ-VAE is equivalent to the EM algorithm", "review": "General:\nThe paper presents an alternative view on the training procedure for the VQ-VAE. The authors have noticed that there is a close connection between the original training algorithm and the well-known EM algorithm. Then, they proposed to use the soft EM algorithm. In the experiments the authors showed that the soft EM allows to obtain significantly better results than the standard learning procedure on both image and text datasets.\n\nIn general, the paper shows a neat link between the well-known EM algorithm and the learning method for the VQ-VAE. I like the manner the idea is presented. Additionally, the results are convincing. I believe that the paper will be interesting for the ICLR audience.\n\nPros:\n+ The connection between the EM algorithms and the training procedure for the VQ-VAE is neat.\n+ The paper is very well written, all concepts are clear and properly outlined.\n+ The experiments are properly performed and all results are convincing.\n\nCons:\n- The paper is rather incremental, however, still interesting.\n- The quality of Figure 1, 2 and 3 (especially Figure 3) is unacceptable.\n- There is a typo in Table 6 (row 5: V-VAE \u2192 VQ-VAE).\n- I miss two references in the related work on training with discrete variables: REBAR (Tucker et al., 2017) and RELAX (Grathwohl et al., 2018).\n- The paper style is not compliant with the ICLR style.\n\n--REVISION--\nI would like to thank authors for their effort to improve quality of images. In my opinion the paper is nice and I sustain my initial score.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
