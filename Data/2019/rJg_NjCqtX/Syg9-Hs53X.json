{"title": "Does not present new ideas", "review": "Name standardization is an important problem in Chemical Information Extraction. In the chemical literature, the same chemical could be referred to by many different names. This work focusses on standardizing non systematic names (for example Asprin to 2-Acetoxybenzoic acid). \n\nThe authors approach this as a machine translation problem. They create a parallel corpus of non-systematic and systematic names and build a seq2seq model for accomplishing this task. The authors report accuracy and BLEU score for the translation task.\n\nMy main concern with this work is novelty. It seems like this is a straightforward application of an existing model for this task. Also it is not clear why BLEU score is an appropriate metric for this task. Is it okay for downstream applications to have the systematic name partially right?\n\nOverall, I think this paper does not present substantially new ideas to merit publication.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
