{"title": "Solid paper with interesting application and dataset", "review": "This work presents a method to translate non-systematic names of chemical compounds into their systematic equivalents. Beyond that, a corpus of systematic and non-systematic chemical names is introduced that were extracted from chemistry and manually labelled.\n\nThe paper is well-structured and the authors introduce the problem setting very nicely to a machine learning audience, explain the challenges and motivate the architecture of their model. The model is a combination of tested approaches such as a spelling error correction, a byte pair encoding tokenizer and a sequence-to-sequence model consisting of (Bi)LSTMs and attention mechanisms. \n\nThe evaluation appears solid. The model achieves significantly improved results on the proposed corpus, even though compared to a underwhelming baseline. The analysis could be improved by showing and explaining some examples of failed translation attempts. It would also be interesting to see how the failed attempts are distributed over the error types (spelling, order, common name, synonym). The authors suggest a scenario where non-systematic names are converted and checked against a database of systematic names. For this, it would be interesting to know whether there are cases where a non-systematic name was translated into the wrong (but valid) systematic name.\n\nConcluding, the paper presents an interesting application for machine translation, a new dataset and a method that successfully labels 50% of the given corpus.\n\nMinor issue: The color scale of Fig. 5 is hard to recognize due to low contrast.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
