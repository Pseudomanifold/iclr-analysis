{"title": "The first work that proposes localized, graph-concolutional GANs for irregular 3D point clouds: fun ideas and exciting to read.", "review": "This paper proposes graph-convolutional GANs for irregular 3D point clouds that learn domain (the graph structure) and features at the same time. In addition, a method for upsampling at the GAN generator is introduced. The paper is very well written, addresses a relevant problem (classification of 3D point clouds with arbitrary, a priori unknown graph structure) in an original way, and supports the presented ideas with convincing experiments. It aggregates the latest developments in the field, the Wasserstein GAN, edge-conditional convolutions into a concise framework and designs a novel GAN generator. I have only some minor concerns:\n\n1)\tMy only serious concern is the degree of novelty with respect to (Achlioptas et al., 2017). The discriminator is the same and although the generator is a fully connected network in that paper, it would be good to highlight conceptual improvements as well as quantitative advantages of the paper at hand more thoroughly. Similarly, expanding a bit more on the differences and improvements over (Grover et al., 2018) would improve the paper. \n\n2)\tP3, second to last line of 2.1: reference needs to be fixed \"\u2026Grover et al. (Grover et al., 2018)\"\n\n3)\tIt would be helpful to highlight the usefulness of artificially generating irregular 3D point clouds from an application perspective, too. While GANs have various applications if applied to images it is not obvious how artificially created irregular 3D point clouds can be useful. Although the theoretical insights presented in the paper are exciting, a more high-level motivation would further improve its quality.\n\n4)\tA discussion of shortcomings of the presented method seems missing. While it is understandable that emphasis is put on novelty and its advantages, it would be interesting to see where the authors see room for improvement. \n", "rating": "9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
