{"title": "Not good enough to accept", "review": "Using the dataset MNIST, the authors empirically studied the robustness of several rotation-equivariant neural network models(GCNN, H-Nets, PTN, et al.) to geometric transformation and small pixel-wise perturbations. Their experiments showed that the equivariant network models(StdCNNs, GCNNs, H-Nets, et al.) are robust to geometric transformation but vulnerable to pixel-wise adversarial perturbations. These findings help us understand the  neural network models better.\nHowever, this paper is not acceptable due to lack of innovation and novelty.
