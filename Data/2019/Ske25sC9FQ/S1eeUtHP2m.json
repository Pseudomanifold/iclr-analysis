{"title": "Interesting empirical study of CNN robustness, potentially good workshop paper", "review": "This paper empirically studies various CNN robustifying mechanisms aiming to achieve rotational invariance. The main finding is that such robustifying mechanisms may lead to lack of robustness against pixel-level attacks such as FGSM and its variants. The paper does a comprehensive job in studying relevant robustifying schemes and attacks strategies. However, the paper does not present sufficiently new information worthy of a regular conference paper, it can be a good workshop paper though for the Robust Learning community. Some analytical insights would really strengthen the work. Also, from an empirical standpoint, the authors need to consider other data sets beyond just the MNIST data set.   \n\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n\nWhile I appreciate the authors' rebuttal and revisions, I still do not see sufficient contribution here worthy of a regular ICLR paper.  ", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
