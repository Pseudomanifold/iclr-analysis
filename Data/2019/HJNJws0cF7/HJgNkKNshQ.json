{"title": "Connecting CNNs with ODE solvers", "review": "The paper takes the perspective that a ResNet can be seen as a discrete time dynamical system approximation, and then uses that insight to introduce a Runge Kutta style continuous dynamical system.  Results are achieved that outperform DenseNet and CliqueNet\n\nQuality\n- The connection between deep nets and dynamical systems is an important one, as a small but growing literature demonstrates.\n- The quality of this paper is difficult to extract, given rather long and unclear definitions of various key choices, at key points opting instead for a speculative connection to neurosciences (see clarity below).\n- The empirical results could make this paper compelling, but the comparisons are rather shallow, in that they compare on only a few datasets and don't compare extensively to many of the state of the art methods.   For example, in Table 2 DenseNet outperforms the IRKNets, but this fact is not highlighted.  Overall this and other key omissions create the concern that the results are not particularly strong.\n- One key reference that is missing is the careful work Chen et al https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07366.  This work provides an excellent basis for how to present these ideas rigorously.\n\nClarity\n- The connections to the brain -- such as \"visual cortex\", \"ventral stream\", etc -- are not rigorous and are unrelated to the paper at hand; really all connections to brain should be removed.  \n- Figures 2 and 3 are the central architectural choices, but the writing around them does not clarify why all the choices have been made, and what the implications are.\n\nOriginality\n- This is one of a small but growing number of papers connecting deep nets to ODE solvers.  Chen et al should be cited (Chen et al https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07366).  \n- There appears to be sufficient originality.\n\nSignificance\n- hard to determine with unclear exposition and rather incomplete empirical results.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
