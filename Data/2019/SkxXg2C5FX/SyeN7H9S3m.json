{"title": "This paper presents (a) a fuzzy bag of word representation and (b) DynaMax, a similarity measure that max pools salient features from sentence pairs.", "review": "Strengths:\n- Good coverage of related work\n- Clear presentation of the methods\n- Evaluation using established SemEval datasets\n\n\nWeaknesses:\n1. It is not entirely clear what is the connection between fuzzy bag of words and DynaMax. In principle DynaMax can work with other methods too. This point should be elaborated a bit more.\n2. It is claimed that the this paper shows that max-pooled word vectors are a special case of fuzzy bag of words. This is not correct. The paper shows how to \"convert\" one to the other. \n3. It is also claimed that point 2 above implies that max-pooled vectors should be compared with the fuzzy Jaccard index instead of cosine similarity. There is no proof or substantial justification to support this. \n4.
