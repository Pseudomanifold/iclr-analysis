{"title": "Very polished paper, simple but effective.", "review": "This is one of the best papers I reviewed so far this year (ICLR, NIPS, ICML, AISTATS), in terms of both the writing and technical novelty.\n\nWriting: the author provided sufficient context and did comprehensive literature survey, which made the paper easily accessible to a larger audience. And the flow of this paper was very smooth and I personally enjoyed reading it.\n\nNovelty: I wouldn't say this paper proposed a groundbreaking innovation, however, compared to many other submissions that are more obscure rather than inspiring to the readers, this paper presented a very natural extension to something practitioners were already very familiar with: taking an average of word vectors for a sentence and measure by cosine similarity.  Both max pooling and Jaccard distance are not something new, but the author did a great job presenting the idea and proved it's effectiveness through extensive experiments. (disclaimer: I didn't follow the sentence embedding literature recently, and I would count on other reviewers to fact check the claimed novelty of this paper by the authors)\n\nSimplicity: besides the novelty mentioned above, what I enjoyed more about this paper is it's simplicity. Not just because it's easy to understand, but also it's easy to be reproduced by practitioners.\n\nQuibbles: the authors didn't provide error bar / confidence interval to the results presented in experiment session. I'd like to know whether the difference between baselines and proposed methods were significant or not.\n\nMiscellaneous: I have to say the authors provided a very eye-catching name to this paper as well, and the content of the paper didn't disappoint me neither. Well done :)\n", "rating": "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
