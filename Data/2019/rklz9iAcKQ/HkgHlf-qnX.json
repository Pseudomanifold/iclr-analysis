{"title": "Solid work, will have high impact", "review": "This paper describes an approach for unsupervised learning of node features on a graph (with known structure), so that learned local representations represent community information that has high mutual info with a graph-level summary. The general idea is they apply InfoMax to graphs via graph convolutional networks (GCN), and report impressive results, including rivaling supervised learning methods for node classification. The 3 experiments are on paper topic classification, social network modeling, and protein classification.\n\nThe idea of using InfoMax with GCNs for unsupervised node learning is clever and timely, the technical contribution is solid, the experiments are executed well, and the paper is clear and easy to read.", "rating": "9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
