{"title": "Novelty and performance evaluation are unclear", "review": "This paper describes a NN method called DyMoN for predicting transition vectors between states with a Markov process, and learning dynamics of stochastic systems.\n\nThree biological case studies are presented, it is unclear if any new biology was learned from these cases that we could not have learned using other methods, and how accurate they are. The empirical validations are all on nonbiological data and disconnected from the first part of the paper, making the main application/advantage of this method confusing.\n\nI agree with the computational advantages mentioned in the paper, however, interpretation of the representational aspect is challenging especially in the context of biological systems. Regarding denoising, what are the guarantees that this approach does now remove real biological heterogeneity? Also, a denoising method (MAGIC) was still used to preprocess the data prior to DyMon, there is no discussion about any contradictory assumptions.\n\nOverall, the main shortcoming of the paper is lack of performance evaluation, comparison to other methods and clarifying advantages or novel results over other methods. The description of the method could also be improved and clarified with presenting an algorithm.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
