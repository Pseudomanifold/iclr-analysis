{"title": "good idea but unclear model", "review": "This manuscript applies transfer learning for protein surface prediction. The problem is important and  the idea is novel and interesting. However, the  transfer learning model is unclear. \nPros:  interesting and novel idea\nCons:  unclear transfer learning model, insufficient experiments. \n\nDetail: section 4 describes the transfer learning model used in the work, but the description is unclear. It is unknown the used model is a new model or existing model. Besides, in the experiments, the proposed method is not compared to other transfer learning methods.  Thus, the evidence of the experiments is not enough.
