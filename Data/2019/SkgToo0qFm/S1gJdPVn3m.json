{"title": "Nice writing. Lack of significant contribution. Insufficient experimental evidence.", "review": "For the task of predicting interaction contact among atoms of protein complex consisting of two interacting proteins, the authors propose to train a Siamese convolutional neural network, noted as SASNet, and to use the contact map of two binding proteins\u2019 native structure.\nThe authors claim that the proposed method outperforms methods that use hand crafted features; also the authors claim that the proposed method has better transferability.\n\nMy overall concern is that the experiment result doesn\u2019t really fully support the claim in the two aspects: 1) the SASNet takes the enriched dataset as input to the neural net but it also uses the complex (validation set) to train the optimal parameters, so strictly it doesn\u2019t really fit in the \u201ctransfer\u201d learning scenario. Also, the compared methods don\u2019t really use the validation set from the complex data for training at all. Thus the experiment comparison is not really fair. 2) The experiment results include standard errors for different replicates where such replicates correspond to different training random seeds (or different samples from the enriched set?), however, it doesn\u2019t include any significance of the sampling. Specifically, the testing dataset is fixed. A more rigorous setting is to, for N runs, each run splitting the validation and testing set differently.\n\nSince this paper is an application paper, rather than a theoretical paper that bears theoretical findings, I would expect much more thorough experimental setup and analysis. Currently it is still missing discussion such as, when SASNet would perform better and when it would perform worse, what it is that the state of the art features can\u2019t capture while SASNet can. Moreover, it is the prediction performance that matters to such task, but the authors remove the non-structure features from the compared methods. Results and discussion about how the previous methods with full features perform compared to SASNet, and also how we can include those features into SASNet should complete the paper.\n\nOverall the paper is well written, and I do think the paper could be much stronger the issues above are addressed.\n\n\nSome minor issues:\n1)\ton page 4, Section 3, the first paragraph, shouldn\u2019t \u201cC_p^{val} of 55\u201d be \u201cC_p^{test} of 55\u201d?\n\n2)\tIt is not clear what the \u201creplicates\u201d refer to in the experiments.\n\n3)\tSome discussion on why the \u201cSASNet ensemble\u201d would yield better performance would be good; could it be overfitting?\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
