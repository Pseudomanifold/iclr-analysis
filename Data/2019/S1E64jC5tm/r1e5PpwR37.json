{"title": "Incremental and trivial observations", "review": "The paper studies embeddings of directed graphs based on SVD. It proposes an interpretation of the embedding obtained from the normalized adjacency matrix in terms of the forward-backward random walk on the graph. In such random walk odd steps are taken using the edges of the graph while even steps are taken using reverse edges. Such an interpretation seems to be a trivial extension of the work for undirected graphs. \n\nFor example, consider bipartite graphs, in such graphs the forward-backward random walk can be seen as a standard random walk on the graph with directions removed. Indeed, if the walk starts in part A then remove all edges from B to A and make A to B edges undirected.\n\n", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
