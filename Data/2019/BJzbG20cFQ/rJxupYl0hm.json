{"title": "Review of Towards Metamerism via Foveated Style Transfer", "review": "This paper presents an interesting analysis of metamerism and a model capable of rapidly producing metamers of value for experimental psychophysics and other domains.\n\nOverall I found this work to be well written and executed and the experiments thorough. Specific points on positives and negatives of the work follow:\n\nPositives:\n- The paper shows a solid understanding of the literature in this domain and presents a strong motivation\n- The problem itself is addressed at a deep level with many nuanced (but important) considerations discussed\n- Ultimately the results of the model seem convincing in particular with the accompanying psychophysical experiments\n\nNegatives:\n- (Maybe not a negative, but a question) At the extreme tradeoff between intrinsic structure and texture, the notion of a metamer seems somewhat obscured. At what point is a metamer no longer a metamer?\n- (Also not necessarily a negative) Exercising SSIM is a valid decision given it's widespread use. I am curious if MS-SSIM, IW-SSIM or other metrics make any significant difference.
