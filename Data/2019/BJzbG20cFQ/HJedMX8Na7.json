{"title": "Towards Metamerism via Foveated Style Transfer", "review": "Summary\nThis paper proposes a NeuroFovea (NF) model for generation of point-of-fixation metamers. As opposed to previous algorithms which use gradient descent to match the local texture and image statistics, NF proposed to use a style transfer approach via an Encoder-Decoder style architecture, which allows it to produce metamers in a single forward pass, allowing it to achieve a significant speed-up as compared to early approaches.\n\nPros\n-The paper tackles a very intriguing topic.\n-The paper is very well written using concise and clear language allowing it to present a large -amount of information in the 10 pages + appendix.\n-The paper provides a thorough discussion of both the problem, related work and the model itself.\n-A single forward pass nature of the model allows it to achieve a 1000x speed-up in generating metamers as opposed to previous GD based approaches.\n-The authors provide enough details to allow for reproducibility.\n\nCons\n-(Not necessarily a negative) Requires a very careful reading as the paper provides a lot of information (though as mentioned it is very well written)\n-The quantitative evaluation is somewhat lacking in that there are no quantitative psychophysical experiments to compare this model to competing ones across different observers. For example, it would have been interesting to compare the ability of observers to distinguish between original images and metamers generated by different models. \n\nAdditional comments\nOn page 10., you show Fig. 13 however you mention at the end of the first paragraph you further elaborate on Fig 13. in the Supplementary Materials. I think it would be better to either provide more discussion in the text and refer to the figure, or just move it fully to Supplementary materials.\n\nAlso, in the qualitative comparison of various models you mention that SideEye runs in milliseconds whereas NF runs in seconds. It would be interesting to discuss the potential trade-off between speed and the quality of generated metamers between the models.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
