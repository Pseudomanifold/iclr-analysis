{"title": "Interesting paper that needs more work", "review": "This work proposes Variational Beta-Bernoulli Dropout, a Bayesian way to sparsify neural networks by adopting Spike and Slab priors over the parameters of the network. Motivated by the Indian Buffet Process the authors further adopt Beta hyperpriors for the parameters of the Bernoulli distribution and also propose a way to set up the model such that it allows for input specific priors over the Bernoulli distributions. They then provide the necessary details for their variational approximations to the posterior distributions of both such models and experimentally validate their performance on the tasks of MNIST and CIFAR 10/100 classification.\n\nThis work is in general well written and conveys the main ideas in an clear manner. Furthermore, parametrising conditional group sparsity in a Bayesian way is also an interesting venue for research that can further facilitate for computational speedups for neural networks. The overall method seems simple to implement and doesn\u2019t introduce too many extra learnable parameters.\n\nNevertheless, I believe that this paper needs more work in order to be published. More specifically:\n\n- I believe that the authors need to further elaborate and compare with \u201cGeneralized Dropout\u201d; the prior imposed on the weights for the non-dependent case is essentially the same with only small differences in the approximate posterior. Both methods seem to optimise, rather than integrate over, the weights of the network and the main difference is in how to handle the approximate distributions over the gates. Why would one prefer one parametrisation rather than the other? Furthermore, the authors of this work argue that they employ asymptotically unbiased gradients for the binary random variables, which is incorrect as the continuous relaxation provides a biased gradient estimator for the underlying discrete model.\n\n- At section 3.2 the authors argue about the inherent sparsity inducing nature of the IBP model. In the finite K scenario this is not entirely the case as sparsity is only encouraged for alpha < K.\n\n- At Eq. 11 the index \u201cn\u201d doesn\u2019t make sense as the Bernoulli probability for each point depends only on the global pi_k. Similarly for Eq. 12.\n\n- Since you tie q(z_nk|pi_k) = p(z_nk|pi_k) then it makes sense to phrase Eq.16 as just D_KL(q(pi) || p(pi)). Furthermore, I believe that you should properly motivate on why tying these two is a sensible thing to do.\n\n- Figure 1 is misleading; you start from a unimodal distribution and then you simply apply a scalar scale and shift to the elements of that distribution. The output of that will always be a unimodal distribution but somehow you end up with a multimodal distribution on the third part of the figure. As a result, I believe that in this case you will not have two clear modes (one at 0 and one at 1) when you apply the hard-sigmoid rectification.\n\n- The motivation for 21 seems a bit confusing to me; what do you mean with insignificant dimensions? What overflow does the epsilon prevent? If the input to the hard sigmoid is a N(0, 1) distribution then you will approximately have 1/3 of the activations having probability close to 1. Furthermore, it seems that you want beta to be small / negative to get sparse outcomes but the text implies that you want it to be large.\n\n- It would be better to rewrite eq. 22 to include also the fact that you have a separate z per layer as currently it seems that the there is only one z. Furthermore, you have written that the variational posterior distribution depends on x_n on the RHS but not on the LHS.\n\n- Above eq. 23 seems that it should be q(z_nk| pi_k, xn) = p(z_nk| pi_k, xn) rather than q(z_nk| pi_k) = p(z_nk| pi_k, xn)\n\n\nRegarding the experiments; the MNIST results are not particularly convincing as the numbers are, in general, similar to other methods. Furthermore, Figure 2 is a bit small and confusing to read. Should FLOPS be on the y-axis or something else? Almost zero flops for the original model doesn\u2019t seem right. Finally, at the CIFAR 10/100 experiment it seems that both BB and DBB achieve the best performance. However, it seems that the accuracy /sparsity obtained for the baselines is inferior to the results obtained on each of the respective papers. For example, SBP managed to get a 2.71x speedup with the VGG on CIFAR 10 and an error of 7.5%, whereas here the error was 8.68% with just 1.34x speedup. The extra visualisations provided at Figure 3 do look interesting though as it shows what the sparsity patterns learn.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
