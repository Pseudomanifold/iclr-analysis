{"title": "Improves stability of training of GANs", "review": "The paper builds on the experimental observations made in Miyato et al. (2018) in which the authors highlight the utility of spectral normalization of weight matrices in the discriminator of a GAN to improve the stability of the training process. The paper proposes to reparameterize the weight matrices by something that looks like the singular value decomposition, i.e. W = U E V^T. Four different techniques to control the spectrum of W by imposing various constraints on E have been discussed. For maintaining the orthonormality of U and V penalties are added to the cost function. The paper also derives a bound on the generalization error and experimentally shows the \"desirable slow decay\"  of singular values in weight matrices of the discriminator. Other experiments which compare the proposed approach with the SN-GAN have also been given.\n \n(1)The paper puts a lot of stress on the stability of the training process in the beginning but clear experiments supporting their claim related to improved \"stability\" are lacking. \n(2)It would be helpful for the readers if more clarity is added to the paper with respect to the desirability of \"slow decay of singular values\" and spectral normalization.\n(3)The point regarding convolutional layers should be part of the main paper.\n\n ", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}
