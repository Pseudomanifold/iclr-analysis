{"title": "An interesting read on the convergence of GANs with gradient penalties, lacking comparisons to WGAN-GP", "review": "Summary: \nThe paper proposes to add to the original GAN (2014) loss a zero-centered gradient penalty as the one defined in the WGAN-GP paper. It also provides an analysis on the mode collapse and lack of stability of classical GANs. The authors compare results using their penalty on a few synthetic examples and on image net dogs generations to results using the classical GAN loss with or without gradient penalties. \n\nPositive points:\nThe paper is interesting to read and well illustrated. \nAn experiment on imagenet illustrates the progress that can be achieved by the proposed penalty.\n\nPoints to improve: \n\nIf I understood correctly, the main contribution resides in the application of the GP proposed by WGAN-GP to the original setting. Why not compare results to WGAN-GP in this case? Since the proposal of GANs, many papers addressed the mode collapse problem. WGAN-GP, VEEGAN, or Lucas et al arXiv:1806.07185, ICML 2018 to name only a few. \nThe related work section looks incomplete with some missing related references as mentioned above, and copy of a segment that appears in the introduction. \nThe submission could maybe improved by segmenting the work into intro / related / background (with clear equations presenting the existing GP) / analysis / approach / experiments\nThe experiments on synthetic data could be improved: for reproducibility, many works on GANs used the same synthetic data as VEEGAN. \nThe imagenet experiment lacks details.
