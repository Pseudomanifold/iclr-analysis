{"title": "a well evaluated solution to an interesting and challenging problem", "review": "This paper presents a method for inferring physical properties of the world (specifically, normals and coefficients of restitution) from both visual and dynamic information.  Objects are represented as trajectories of point clouds used under an encoder/decoder neural network architecture.  Another network is then learned to predict the post bounce trajectory representation given the prebounce trajectory representation given the surface parameters.  This is used both to predict the post bound trajectory (with a forward pass) but also to estimate the surface parameters through an optimization procedure.  This is coupled with a network which attempts to learn these properties from visual cues as well.  This model can be either pretrained and fixed or updated to account for new information about a scene.\n\nThe proposed model is trained on a newly collected dataset that includes a mixture of real sequences (with RGB, depth, surface normals, etc) and simulated sequences (additionally with physical parameters) generated with the help of a physics engine.  It is compared with a number of relevant baseline approaches and ablation models.  The results suggest that the proposed model is effective at estimating the physical properties of the scene.\n\nOverall the paper is well written and thoroughly evaluated.  The problem is interesting and novel, the collected dataset is likely to be useful and the proposed solution to the problem is reasonable.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
