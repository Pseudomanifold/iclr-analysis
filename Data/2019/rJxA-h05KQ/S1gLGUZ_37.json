{"title": "Inhibited Softmax for Uncertainty Estimation in Neural Networks", "review": "Paper claims that the modified version of softmax known as inhibited softmax can be used to calculate uncertainty.\n\nInhibited softmax can be thought of as having an extra output, i.e if there were 3 classes then normal softmax would have 3 nodes at the output but inhibited softmax can be thought of as having the 4th node with a constant output(value of constant is hyperparameter).\n\nThe output of this extra node in inhibited softmax is used to quantify uncertainty.\n\n\nPros\n- The method requires only one forward pass, unlike popular Bayesian methods.\n- seems to work for out of distribution detection.\n\nCons\n- No mathematical intuition as to why the output of the extra node can be taken as a measure for uncertainty.\n- In cases where final output is not a softmax (i.e regression) then the method is not applicable in its current form. (This and other cons have been acknowledged in the paper)\n\nMy concerns\n- the method does some modifications such as turning off bias in the penultimate layer etc. What if we do all those changes and keep the softmax layer as it is? This might help to figure out if the advantage was due to inhibited softmax alone or the engineering tricks done to make it work.\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
