{"title": "Review", "review": "This paper proposes a novel approach with the hypothesis that the reliable features can guide the less reliable ones. This approach is applied to the object detection task and show consistent performance improvements.\n\npros)\n(+) This paper is well-written and easy to follow.\n(+) The base idea that divides the learned features into two sets; the reliable feature set and the less reliable one is very interesting and looks novel. Plus, the hypothesis, which is that reliable features can guide the features in the less reliable set is also interesting.\n(+) The performance improvements are quite large.\n(+) Extensive ablative studies are provided to support the proposed method well.\n\ncons)\n(-) The method of obtaining the representative in buffer B is not clearly presented.\n(-) The overall training and inference procedure are not clearly presented. \n(-) Some notations and descriptions are vague and confusing.\n(-) More than two datasets are necessary to show the effectiveness of the methods\n\ncomments)\n- What is the higher level feature map P_m? and How did you choose the higher level feature map at the m-th level in option (b) and (c) in Section 3.3.\n- What is the meaning of the \"past\" features in Section 3.2?\n- It is better to show the exact architecture of the make-up module and the critic module.\n- Can this method apply to the other backbones such as VGG or ResNets without FPN?\n- The sentences at the bottom of p.4 starting with \"Note that only~\" looks ambiguous. \n- f_critic^j may be the j-th element of F_critic, please denote what f_critic^j stands for.\n\nEven if the paper needs to be revised for better readability, I think this paper is above the standard of ICLR because the idea is interesting and novel. Furthermore, the experimental studies are properly designed and well support the main idea. I am leaning toward acceptance, but I would like to see the other reviewers' comments.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
