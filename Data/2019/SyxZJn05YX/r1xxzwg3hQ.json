{"title": "performance is good but novelty is limited", "review": "This paper aims to facilitate feature learning in NN models by exploiting more from reliable examples. This is very similar to self-paced learning where the model  learns from the easier samples at first and proceeds to learn from difficult and challenging samples. The authors should discuss their difference with self-paced learning. \n\nThe method is positioned as a general one for feature learning. I do not know the reason why the authors only apply for object detection on a very specific dataset. It is expected to see whether the proposed method is also effective for image classification. \n\nMore datasets for evaluation are needed, even only for the object detection application.
