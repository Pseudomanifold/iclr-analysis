{"title": "Very interesting and promising approach", "review": "The authors introduce a continuous relaxation for categorical variables so as to utilize the gradient descent to optimize the connection weights and the network architecture. It is a cool idea and I enjoyed the paper. \n\nOne question, which I think is relevant in practice, is the initialization of the architecture parameters. I might be just missing, but I couldn't find description of the initial parameter values. As it is gradient based, it might be sensitive to the initial value of alpha. \n\nIn (5), the subscript for alpha should be removed as it defines a function of alpha. I think (5) is misleading as it is because of k-1.
