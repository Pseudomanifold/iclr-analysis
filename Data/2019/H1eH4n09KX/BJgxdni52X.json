{"title": "Fascinating problem & fair results", "review": "This paper presents a GAN-based method to perform audio super-resolution. In contrast to previous work, this work uses auto-encoder to obtain feature losses derived from unlabeled data. \n\nComments:\n(1) Redundant comma: \u201cfilters with very large receptive fields are required to create high quality, raw audio\u201d.\n\n(2) There are some state-of-the-art non-autoregressive generative models for audio waveform e.g., parallel wavenet, clarinet. One may properly discuss them in related work section. Although GAN performs very well for images, it hasn't obtained any compelling results for raw audios. Still, it\u2019s very interesting to explore that. Any nontrivial insight would be highly appreciated.\n\n(3) In multiscale convolutional layers, it seems only larger filter plays a significant role. What if we omit small filter, e.g., 3X1?\n\n(4) It seems the proposed MU-GAN introduces noticeable noise in the upsampled audios. \n\nPros:\n- Interesting idea and fascinating problem. \nCons:\n- The results are fair. I didn\u2019t see big improvement over previous work (Kuleshov et al., 2017).\n\nI'd like to reconsider my rating after the rebuttal.\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
