{"title": "Differentially private variant of the federated learning framework", "review": "The paper revisits the federated learning framework from McMahan in the context of differential privacy.  The general concern with the vanilla federated learning framework is that it is susceptible to differencing attacks. To that end, the paper proposes to make the each of the interaction in the server-side component of the gradient descent to be differentially private w.r.t. the client contributions. This is simply done by adding noise (appropriately scaled) to the gradient updates.\n\nMy main concern is that the paper just described differentially private SGD, in the language of federated learning. I could not find any novelty in the approach. Furthermore, just using the vanilla moment's accountant to track privacy depletion in the federated setting is not totally correct. The moment's accountant framework in Abadi et al. uses the \"secrecy of the sample\" property to boost the privacy guarantee in a particular iteration. However, in the federated setting, the boost via secrecy of the sample does not hold immediately. One requirement of the secrecy of the sample theorem is that the sampled client has to be hidden. However, in the federated setting, even if one does not know what information a client sends to the servery, one can always observe if the client is sending *any* information.
