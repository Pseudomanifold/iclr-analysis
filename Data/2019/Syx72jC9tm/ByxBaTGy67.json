{"title": "Beautiful work -- problems with experiments", "review": "The paper presents a maximally expressive parameter-sharing scheme for hypergraphs, and in general when modeling the high order interactions between elements of a set. This setting is further generalized to multiple sets. The paper shows that the number of free parameters in invariant and equivariant layers corresponds to the different partitioning of the index-set of input and output tensors. Experimental results suggest that the proposed layer can outperform existing methods in supervised learning with graphs.\n\nThe paper presents a comprehensive generalization of a recently proposed model for interaction across sets, to the setting where some of these sets are identical. This is particularly useful and important due to its applications to graphs and hyper-graphs, as demonstrated in experiments.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed reading the paper. My only concern is the experiments:\n\n1) Some of the benchmark datasets for the proposed task as well as some well-known methods (see Battaglia et al\u201918 and references in there) are missing.\n\n2) Applying the model of Hartford et al\u201918 to problems where interacting sets are identical is similar to applying convolution layer to a feature vector that is not equivariant to translation. (In both cases the equivariance group of data is a strict subgroup of the equivariance of the layer.)  Do you agree that for this reason, all the experiments on the synthetic dataset is flawed?\n", "rating": "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
