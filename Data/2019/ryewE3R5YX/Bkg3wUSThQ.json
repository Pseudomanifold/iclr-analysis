{"title": "Connections of each attack setting to a specific threat scenario should be discussed.", "review": "The attack methods are clearly and extensively described and the paper is well organized overall. Some of the attacks are a straightforward variation of known attacks.  Strong original contributions are not found in this work while I do not think lack of original contributions is a minus for this type of paper. One concern is that the connections of each attack setting to a specific threat scenario in the real world are not discussed in this paper. The authors display 14 types of attacks under various settings. Which attack is likely to be performed by what kind of adversaries in what situation?  For this type of security research, contribution becomes weak without a connection to a threat in the real world. Suppose attack scenario A destroys a policy network more seriously than attack scenario B. Even in such a situation, a rescue for attack scenario A might not be needed if attack scenario A is not realistic at all. Even if connections to threats in the real world is not clear, it would be important for security analysis to learn about the worst case. Unfortunately, this work simply exhibits a catalogue of attacks against RL and does not give a deep insight into what we should do to make RL secure. \n\nThe summarization of the attack scenarios against RL is high quality and the results shown in this paper would be useful for many researchers. I expect authors to give more discussions on connections to the real world.\n \n\n\n\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
