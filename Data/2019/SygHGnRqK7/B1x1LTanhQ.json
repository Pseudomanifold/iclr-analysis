{"title": "Unclear advantage", "review": "The paper uses the beta process to do federated neural matching. The brief experimental results show worse performance than the other techniques compared with. Also, the motivation for the hierarchical beta process isn't clear, since each group has a single Bernoulli process. This makes learning each second level beta process a meaningless task. Why not have a single beta-Bernoulli process?", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
