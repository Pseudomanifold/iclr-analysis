{"title": "LEARNING INTERNAL DENSE BUT EXTERNAL SPARSE STRUCTURES OF DEEP NEURAL NETWORK", "review": "The authors bridge two components (density of CNNs and sparsity structures) by proposing a new network structure with locally dense yet externally sparse connections. \n\n+ Combination of being dense and sparse is an interesting area.\n- Although experiment results demonstrate evolving sparse connection could reach competitive results, it would be interesting to show how separating a network into several small networks is useful, for example, interpretablity of deep neural network. There is an interesting work: \"Using deep learning to model the hierarchical structure and function of a cell\" https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.4627\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}
