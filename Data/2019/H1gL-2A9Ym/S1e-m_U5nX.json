{"title": "review on \"Personalized Embedding Propagation: Combining Neural Networks on Graphs with Personalized PageRank\"", "review": "This paper proposed a variant of graph neural network, which added additional pagerank-like propagations (with constant aggregation weights), in additional to the normal message-passing like propagation layers. Experiments on some benchmark transductive node classification tasks show some empirical gains.\n\nUsing more propagations with constant aggregation weights is an interesting idea to help propagate the information in a graph. However, this idea is not completely new. In the very first graph neural network [1], the propagation is done until convergence. If the operator in each layer is a contraction map, then according to the Banach Fixed Point theorem [2], a unique solution can be guaranteed. The constant operator used in this paper is thus a special case of this contraction map.\n\nAlso, the closed form solution in (3) is not practical. It may not be suitable for large graphs (e.g., graphs with >10k nodes). And that\u2019s why this approach is not suitable for Pubmed and Microsoft dataset. The PEP_A is more practical. However, in this case I\u2019m curious how it would compare with a GNN having same number of layers, but with proper gating/skip connections like ResNet. \n\nThe experiments show some marginal gains on the small graphs. However, I think it would be important to test on large graphs. Since small graphs typically have small diameter, thus several GNN layers would already cover the entire graph, and the additional propagation done by pagerank here might not be super helpful. \n\nFinally, I think the author should properly cite another relevant paper [3], which uses fixed point iteration to help propagate the local information. \n\n[1] Scarselli et.al, \u201cThe Graph Neural Network Model\u201d, IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks, 2009\n[2] Mohamed A.
