{"title": "Interesting but limited contribution", "review": "The thurst behind this paper is that graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are constrained by construction\nto focus on small neighborhoods around any given node. Large neighborhoods introduce in principle\na large number of parameters (while as the authors point out, weight sharing is an option to avoid this issue), \nplus even worse oversmoothing may occur. Specifically, Xu et al. (2018) showed that for a k-layer GCN one can \nthink of the influence score of a node x on node y as the probability  that a walker that starts at x, \nlands on y after k steps of random walk (modulo some details). \n\nTherefore, as k increases the random walks reaches its stationary distribution, forgetting any local information that is useful, \ne.g., for node classification. To avoid this problem, the authors propose the following: use personalized Pagerank\ninstead of the standard Markov chain of Pagerank. In PPR there is a restart probability, which allows \ntheir algorithm to avoid \u201cforgetting\u201d the local information around a walk, thus allowing for an arbitrary \nnumber of steps in their random walk. The authors define two methods PEP, and PEPa based on PPR. The latter \nmethod is faster in practice since it approximates the PPR.   \n\nA key advantage of the proposed method is the separation of the node embedding part from the propagation scheme. In this sense, \nfollowing the categorization of existing methods into three categories, PEP is a hybrid of message passing algorithms,\nand random walk based node embeddings. The experimental evaluation tests certain basic properties of the proposed method. One interesting performance feature of \nPEP and PEPa is that they can perform well using few training examples. This is valuable especially when obtaining labeled\nexamples is expensive.  Finally, the authors compare their proposed methods against state-of-the-art GCN-based methods.  \n\nSome remarks follow. \n\n- The idea of using PPR for node embeddings has been suggested in recent prior work \u201cLASAGNE: Locality and structure aware graph node embeddings\u201d \nBy Faerman et al.  While according to the authors\u2019 categorization of the existing methods in the intro, LASAGNE \nfalls under the \u201crandom walk\u201d family  of methods, the authors should compare against it. \n \n- Continuing the previous point,  even simpler baselines would be desirable. How inferior is for instance \nan approach on one-vs-all classification using the approximate personalized Pagerank node embedding and \nsupport vector machines?  \n \n- Also, the authors mention \u201csince our datasets are somewhat similar\u2026\u201d. Please clarify with respect to \nwhich aspects? Also, please use datasets that are different. For instance, see the LASAGNE paper for \nmore datasets that have different number of classes.  \n\n- In the experiments the authors use two layers for fair comparison. Given that one of the advantages of the \nproposed method is the  ability to have more layers without suffering from the GCN shortcomings \nwith large neighborhood exploration, it would be interesting to see an experiment where the number of layers is a variable. \n\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
