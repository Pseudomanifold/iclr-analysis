{"title": "strong paper ", "review": "The Authors of this paper investigate Neuro-Symbolic methods in the context of learning a SAT solver generalized to the Circuit-SAT problem. Using a reinforcement learning \u2013 inspired approach to demonstrate a framework that is capable of (unsupervised) learning, by means of an end-to-end differentiable training procedure. Their formulation incorporates the solving of a given SAT problem into the architecture, meaning the algorithm is trained to produce a solution if a given problem is satisfiable. This is in contrast to previous similar work by (Selsam et al. 2018), where the framework was trained as a SAT classifier. Their results outline the performance increase over the previous work (Selsam et al. 2018) on finding a given solution for a SAT problem, on in-sample and out-sample results.\n\nNeg: \nFigure descriptions are not very clear\nWhen it comes to comparing the results, they do use a prepossessing step for their algorithm which they do not incorporate into the results\n\nPros:\nClear outline of the data sets used for benchmarks.\nGood Literature review, expressing in-depth knowledge of the current state of the art formulation for same/similar tasks \nExtensive background section, that explains the theoretical concepts and their architecture used well.\nClear outline of the Solver, where the individual parts/networks are explained and justified in detail\nVery well outlined argumentation for approaching this particular problem by the proposed method/\nThe experimental results as well are easy to follow and show promising results for the proposed framework\nThe proposed method as well is novel and outperforms similar algorithms in the experimental evaluation.\n\n\nThe paper is very well written, proposes a novel Neuro-Symbolic  approach to the classical SAT problem, and demonstrates promising results.\n ", "rating": "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
