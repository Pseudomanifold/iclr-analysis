{"title": "Potentially interesting results, very dense and confusing writing", "review": "The paper shows Turing completeness of two modern neural architectures, the Transformer and the Neural GPU. The paper is technically very heavy and gives very little insight and intuition behind the results. Right after surveying the previous work the paper starts stacking definitions and theorems without much explanations.\n\nWhile technical results are potentially quite strong I believe a major revision to the paper might be necessary in order to clarify the ideas. I would even suggest to split the paper into two, one about each architecture as in the current form it is quite long and difficult to follow. \n\nResults are claimed to hold without access to external memory, relying just on the network itself to represent the intermediate results of the computation. I am a bit confused by this statement -- what if the problem at hand is, say EXPSPACE-complete? Then the network would have to be of exponential size (or more generally of arbitrary size which is independent of the input). In this case the claim about not using external memory seems to be kind of vacuous as the network itself has unbounded size. The whole point of Turing-completeness is that the program size is independent of the input size so there seems to be some confusion here.\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}
