{"title": "not entirely novel with few concerns but includes results leading to interesting insights", "review": "The paper has two distinct parts. In the first part (section 2) it studies the volume of preimage of a ReLU network\u2019s activation at a certain layer as being singular, finite, or infinite. This part is an extension of the work in the study of (Carlsson et al. 2017). The second part (section 3) builds on the piecewise linearity of a ReLU network\u2019s forward function. As a result, each point in the input space is in a polytope where the model acts linearly. In that respect, it studies the stability of the linearized model at a point in the input space. The study involves looking at the singular values of the linear mapping. \n\nThe findings of the paper are non-trivial and the implications potentially interesting. However, I have some concerns about the study.\n\nThere is a key concern about the feasibility of the numerical analysis for the first part. That is, a layer-by-layer study can have a computational problem where the preimage is finite at each layer but can become infinite by the mapping of the preceding layers. In that regard, I would like the authors to comment on the worst-case computational complexity of the numerical analysis for determining the volume of a preimage through multiple layers.\n\nAs for the second part, the authors mention the increase in the dimensionality of the latent space in the current deep networks. However, this observation views convolutional networks as MLPs. However, there is more structure in a convolutional layer\u2019s mapping function. The structure is obtained by the shared and sparse rows of matrix A. I would like the authors to comment on how the studies will be affected by this property of the common networks.\n\nAll in all, while there are some concerns and the contributions are not entirely novel, the reviewer believes the findings of the paper is generally non-trivial and shed more light on the inner workings of the ReLU networks and is thus a valuable contribution to the field.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
