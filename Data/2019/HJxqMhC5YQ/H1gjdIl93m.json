{"title": "Applying known techniques to a non problem", "review": "The authors propose to build a speech recognition system that has been trained to recognize a recording that has been produced by mixing multiple recordings from different languages together, and allowing for some code switching (also done artificially by concatenating different recordings).\n\nWhile this sounds fancy and like a hard problem, it is in fact easier than recognizing two speakers that have been mixed together speaking the same language, which has already been solved in (Seki, 2018a), from what I can tell. I don't see any contribution in this paper, other than explaining how to create an artificial (un-realistic) database of mixed speech in multiple languages, and then training a multi-speaker end-to-end speech recognition system on that database.\n", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
