{"title": "not enough novelty", "review": "This paper presents an end-to-end system that can recognize single-channel multiple-speaker speech with multiple languages.\n\nPros:\n- The paper is well written.\n- It shows the existing end-to-end multi-lingual ASR (Seki et al., 2018b) and end-to-end multi-speaker ASR (Seki et al., 2018a) techniques can be combined without any change to achieve reasonable performance.\n- It demonstrates the challenge of single-channel multi-lingual multiple-speaker speech recognition, and compares the performance of the multiple-speaker system on the mixed speech and the single-speaker system on the isolated speech.\n\nCons:\n- It lacks novelty: the proposed framework just simply combines the two existing techniques as mentioned above.\n- The training and evaluation data are both artificially created by randomly concatenating utterances with different languages from different speakers with different context. I am not sure of how useful the evaluation is, since this situation is not realistic. Also, currently it cannot test the real code-switching since the utterances are not related and not from the same speaker.\n- There are not enough analyses. E.g. it would be good to analyze what contributes to the gap between the single-speaker ASR system performance on the isolated speech and the multi-lingual multi-speaker ASR system on the mixed speech. How well does the proposed end-to-end framework perform compared to a two-step framework with speaker separation followed by multi-lingual single-speaker ASR?", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
