{"title": "Clever idea with some weaknesses...", "review": "Thanks for the submission of you work. As far as I understood it correctly you deal with the idea to test the shift invariance of a given model on Helvetica digits. You propose that idea as general quantifiable approach.\n\nIn general, your paper is well-written, compact, in a good style and with a length of 5 pages really short.\n\nIn the introduction, you cite the work of Hinton and Sabour and describe the Capsule framework in general. I think that this description is not really precise. The aforementioned contributions are really different and your general explanation is technically incorrect.\n\nThe major concerns about your contributions are:\n1. Helvetica digits are not in American digit style, e.g. check the digit one. The MNIST database consists of American handwritten digits. Why you\u2019re not using an American digit font? What is the impact on your model due to that change?\n2. Fig. 1 in your contribution: It seems that your digits are too small compared to MNIST digits. Is that true? Note that MNIST digits are size normalized.\n3. What is the outstanding advantage of your proposal compared to a simple shift of a MNIST digit or the usage of the affNIST dataset?\n4. Page 4: You are mentioning that it is interesting that the reconstructed image looks like a handwritten digit. Why you think it is interesting? I would assume that this is a natural behavior since your network was trained to do so.\n\nPlease clarify the questions above and highlight what is the advantage of your method compared to simple shifts of MNIST digits or even the usage of affNIST. Right now, I\u2019m not seeing a real advantage neither a scientific contribution.  \n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
