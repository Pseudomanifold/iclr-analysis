{"title": "Not sufficiently novel", "review": "\n- This \"neural brainwashing\" is catastrophic forgetting. Technically speaking, this is catastrophic forgetting. \n\n- Also, some works targeting NAS (which I reckon should as well be cited due to being quite related) have targeted similar forgetting issues, e.g. Xu and Zhu, NIPS 2018 \"Reinforced continual learning\". It is nice to enrich the literature with new terms, when there is a need to. In my opinion, in this particular case, neural brainwashing is catastrophic forgetting. \n\n- Forgetting is not necessarily an \"individual problem\", sticking to the language used in the third paragraph of the first page. The same applies to \"single-model forgetting\". \n\n- page 1 \"Our work is the first of which we are aware to identify neural brainwashing and to propose a solution.\": According to the authors' argument, this is the case. Again, mine is different.\n\n- Novelty w.r.t. works tackling catastrophic forgetting, most notably EWC, is minimal. Also, comparing to other state-of-the-art algorithms targeting catastrophic forgetting can further enrich the experiments. \n\n- 3.1.1. On a technical level, there is no inherent difference, between EWC and the proposed algorithm. \n\n- Writing can improve, both in terms of the flow and the language. There are also a few typos, e.g. in the first line of the caption of Figure 2.\n\n- Apart from the aforementioned issue (comparing to other state-of-the-art catastrophic forgetting algorithms), the experiments are rigorously prepared.
