{"title": "Original idea, clear presentation", "review": "*Summary*\nA clear an interresting presentation on learning sequences distributions. It achieve this objective by replacing the discriminator with a \"mediator\", a mixture between the training distribution and the target distribution which is estimated via maximum likelihood.\n\n*Pros*\n- Original idea for modelling distribution of sequence data\n- Theoretical convergence in the Jensen Shanon divergence sense\n- Promising experiments\n\n*Cons*\n- No major cons to the best of my knowledge\n\n*Typos*\n- It would be very nice to have black and white / color blind friendly graphs\n- Eq 10 too long\n- Introduce J_m & J_g in  sentence\n- Coma at the end of Eq 5, and maybe align Generator and Discriminator in some position (e.g. at the semi colon).\n- missing dot at Eq 8.\n\n*Question*\n- How would you ensure reproducibility (e.g. link to some code?)\n- Is there any hope to obtain consistency (convergence) wrt other metrics?", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}
