{"title": "Mathematically elegant, insufficient experimentation", "review": "The paper proposes the use of Survival Continuous Ranked Probability score instead of maximum likelihood estimation for personalised probabilistic forecasts of time-to-event data, thus estimating a distribution over future time. The authors describe the evaluation their method using (1) proper scoring rule objectives; (2) evaluation of calibration using sharpness as a metric; (3) the survival precision recall curve. The authors then apply these techniques to predicting time-to-mortality using an RNN that takes EHR patient records to predict the probability of death at a given time point. It\u2019s not clear how this is related to the Survival CRPS model or how this model is incorporated into the RNN.\nOverall, this is an important framework for estimating personalised predictions of survival events for patients with interval-censored data. The authors present a well thought-out paper with clearly and realistically articulated modelling  assumptions. The authors also give an excellent critique of the underlying assumptions of current state-of-the-art survival methods. The authors are also to be commended for the mathematical elegance \nAlthough the paper is very well written and extremely well structured, I struggled with the lack of experiments available in the paper.\nThe text embedded in Figure 3 is too small. \nThe results section is somewhat sparse. Although the mathematical formulation is well-motivated and structured, it\u2019s not clear what the contribution of this work is. The difference between CRPS-INTVL and MLE-INTVL is incremental and it\u2019s unclear what the significant benefits are of CRPS vs MLE. What would the interpretation of these differences in a real-world setting? \n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
