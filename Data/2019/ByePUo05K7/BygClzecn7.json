{"title": "clever experiments with interesting implications", "review": "This paper adds to a growing body of literature which suggests that modern CNNs use qualitatively different visual strategies for object recognition compared to human observers. More specifically, the authors create shapeless object features (by adding noise masks in various forms or single pixels that are predictive of categorization to object images) to study how much CNNs rely on shape information (as humans would) as opposed to shapeless arbitrary statistical dependencies between pixels. \n\nThe hypotheses tested are straightforward and the experiments cleverly answer these questions. On the negative side, there is nothing groundbreaking in this study. As acknowledged by the authors, the results are not all that novel in light of recent work that has already shown that one could conduct adversarial attacks by corrupting a single pixel as well as work that has shown that CNNs do not generalize to noise degradations they have not seen. Still, there is value in the work presented as the empirical tests described address the role of shape in object recognition with CNNs.\n\nIn a sense, the present study offers a null result and obviously, the work would have been much more significant had the authors offered a mechanism to get CNNs to learn to prioritize \"shape\" features (then verifying that such network would work on CIFAR, but performed poorly on the shapeless images).\n\nAdditional analysis involving visualization methods to further explain why shape features were ignored would have been a plus\u2013 with bonus points for providing a heuristic to determine the \"shapelessness\" of a convolution kernel.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
