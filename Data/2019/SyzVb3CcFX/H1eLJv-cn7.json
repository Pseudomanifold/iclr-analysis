{"title": "Very interesting proposal and well-written method. Experiments section is though poorly structured", "review": "Revision\n----------\nThanks for taking the comments on board. I like the paper, before and after, and so do the other reviewers. Some video results might prove more valuable to follow than the tiny figures in the paper and supplementary. Adding notes on limitations is helpful to understand future extensions.\n\n-----------------------------------------------\nInitial Feedback:\n---------------------\nThis is a very exciting proposal that deviates from the typical assumption that all future frames can be predicted with the same certainty. Instead, motivated by the benefits of discovering bottlenecks for hierarchical RL, this work attempts to predict \u2018predictable video frames\u2019 \u2013 those that can be predicted with certainty, through minimising over all future frames (in forward prediction) or all the sequence (in bidirectional prediction). Additional, the paper tops this with a variational autoencoder to encode uncertainty, even within those predictable frames, as well as a GAN for pixel-level generation of future frames. \n\nThe first few pages of the paper are a joy to read and convincing by default without looking at experimental evidence. I do not work myself in video prediction, but having read in the area I believe the proposal is very novel and could make a significant shift in how prediction is currently perceived. It is a paper that is easy to recommend for publication based on the formulation novelty, topped with VAEs and GANs as/when needed.\n\nBeyond the method\u2019s explanation, I found the experiment section to be poorly structured. The figures are small and difficult to follow \u2013 looking at all the figures it felt that \u201cmore is actually less\u201d. Many of the evidence required to understand the method are only included in the appendices. However, having spent the time to go back and forth, I believe the experiments to be scientifically sound and convincing.\n\nI would have liked a discussion in the conclusion on the method\u2019s limitation. This reviewer believes that the approach will struggle to deal with cyclic motions. In this case the discovered bottlenecks might not be the most useful to predict, as these will correspond to future frames (not nearby though) that are visually similar to the start (in forward) or to the start/end (in bidirectional) frames. An additional loss to reward difficult-to-predict frames (though certain compared to other times) might be an interesting additional to conquer more realistic (rather than synthetic) video sequences.\n", "rating": "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
