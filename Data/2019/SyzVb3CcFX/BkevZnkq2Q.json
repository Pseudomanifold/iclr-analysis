{"title": "Good novel contribution", "review": "Summary:\nThe paper reformulates the task of video prediction/interpolation so that a predictor is not forced to generate frames at fixed time intervals, but instead it is trained to generate frames that happen at any point in the future. The motivation for such approach is that there might be future states that are highly uncertain \u2013 and thus, difficult to predict \u2013 that might not be useful for other tasks involving video prediction such as planning. The authors derive different loss functions for such Time-Agnostic Prediction (TAP), including extensions to the Variational AutoEncoders (VAE) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) frameworks, and conduct experiments that suggest that the frames predicted by TAP models correspond to \u2018subgoal\u2019 states useful for planning.\n\nStrenghts:\n[+] The idea of TAP is novel and intuitively makes sense. \nIt is clear that there are frames in video prediction that might not be interesting/useful yet are difficult to predict, TAP allows to skip such frames.\n[+] The formulation of the TAP losses is clear and well justified. \nThe authors do a good job at showing a first version of a TAP loss, generalizing it to express preferences, and its extension to VAE and GAN models, showing that \n\nWeaknesses:\n[-] The claim that the model discovers meaningful planning subgoals might be overstated. \nThe hierarchical planning evaluation experiment seems like it would clearly favor TAP compared to a fixed model (why would the middle prediction in time of the fixed model correspond to reasonable planning goals?). Furthermore, for certain tasks and environments it seems like the uncertain frames might be the ones that correspond to important subgoals. For example, for the BAIR Push Dataset, usually the harder frames to predict are the arm-object interactions, which probably would correspond to the relevant subgoals.\n\nOverall I believe that the idea in this paper is a meaningful novel contribution. The paper is well-written and the experiments support the fact that TAP might be a better choice for training frame predictors for certain tasks.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
