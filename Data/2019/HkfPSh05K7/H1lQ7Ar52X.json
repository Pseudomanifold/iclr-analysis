{"title": "Interesting and encouraging results but limited novelties", "review": "The paper proposes a multi-document extractive machine reading model and algorithm. The model is composed of 3 distinct parts. First, the document retriever and the document reader that are states of the art modules. Then, the paper proposes to use a \"multi-step-reasoner\" which learns to reformulate the question into its latent space wrt its current value and the \"state\" of the machine reader.\n\nIn the general sense, the architecture can be seen as a specific case of a memory network. Indeed, the multi-reasoner step can be seen as the controller update step of a memory network type of inference. The retriever is the attention module and the reader as the final step between the controller state and the answer prediction.\n\nThe authors claim the method is generic, however, the footnote in section 2.3 mentioned explicitly that the so-called state of the reader assumes the presence of a multi-rnn passage encoding. Furthermore, this section 2.3 gives very little detailed about the \"reinforcement learning\" algorithms used to train the reasoning module.\n\nFinally, the experimental section, while giving encouraging results on several datasets could also have been used on QAngoroo dataset to assess the multi-hop capabilities of the approach. Furthermore, very little details are provided regarding the reformulation mechanism and its possible interpretability.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
