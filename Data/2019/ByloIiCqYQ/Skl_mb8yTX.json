", "review": "This paper proposes a model to automatically extracted features for vulnerability detection using deep learning technique. \n\nPros:\n+ Create a labeled dataset for binary code vulnerability detection and attempts to solve the difficult but practical task of vulnerability detection.\n+ Expend VAE from single prior to multiple priors. \n+ Using figures and visualizations to show the behaviors of model.\n\nCons:\n- The operation that creates dataset may introduce bias or variance. (The developed tool that automatically detects the syntactical errors in a given piece of source code, fixes them, and finally compiles the fixed source code into binaries, may change the distribution of data.) Why not follow the way of producing dataset of malware detection or other tasks that using binary code.\n- It seems that the proposed model fails to consider the properties of the binary codes in this task. It would be more interesting if some design incorporates the special properties of the task.\n- The discussion in Figure 2 and equations  are unclear. More explanations are needed. e.g. how to testing with label-unknown data.\n- Many typos are found. E.g., : the given given  -> the given;    k = 1,2 should be k = 0,1  \n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
