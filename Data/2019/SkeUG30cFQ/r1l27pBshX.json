{"title": "An important contribution.", "review": "In this paper, the authors prove that bounded width diagonal-circulant ReLU networks (I will call them DC-ReLU henceforth) are universal approximators (this was shown previously without the bounded width condition). They also show that bounded width and small depth DC-ReLUs can approximate deep ReLU nets with row rank parameters matrices. This explains the observed success of such networks. The authors also provide experiments to demonstrate the compression one can achieve without sacrificing accuracy.\n\nPros: The authors provide strong approximation results that explain the observed success of DC-ReLUs.\n\nCons: Too many grammatical errors (mainly improper pluralization of verbs and punctuation errors), typos, stylistic inconsistencies seriously affect the readability of the paper. The authors should pay more attention to these.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
