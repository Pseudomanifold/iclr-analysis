{"title": "Contributions seem incremental and concerns regarding the formulated approach", "review": "The paper proposes an improvement over the AQM approach for an information-theoretic framework for task-oriented dialog systems. Specifically, the paper tries to circumvent the problem of explicitly calculating the information gain while asking a question in the AQM setting. While the original AQM approach sweeps over all possible guesses and answers while estimating information gain, this is rendered impractical in scenarios where this space cannot be tractably enumerated. As a solution, AQM+ proposes sweeping over only some top-k relevant instantiations of answers and guesses in this space by normalizing the probabilities of the subset of the space in consideration. In addition, unlike AQM, AQM+ can ask questions which are relevant to the dialog context so far. Consequentially, this is generalizable and applicable for dialog systems with non \u2018yes/no\u2019 answers. Empirical observations demonstrate improvements over the existing approaches for such task-oriented dialog systems. The paper is not very well-written and at times is hard to understand. The contributions seem incremental as well in addition to the concerns mentioned below.\n\nComments:\n- The paper is overloaded with notations and the writing is not very smooth. The terse nature of the content makes it hard to follow in general. If someone apriori was not familiar with task-oriented dialog or the visual dialog setting in Das et al. (2017b), it would be quite hard to follow.\n- While mentioning SL/RL approaches while comparing or introducing the setup, the authors do not make any distinction between discriminative and generative dialog models. Specifically, SL approaches could either be trained discriminatively to rank options among the provided ones given dialog context or in a generative manner via token-level teacher forcing. The authors should clearly make this distinction in the introduction and in other places where it\u2019s needed.\n- The authors should stress more upon the approximations involved while calculating mutual information. As far as I understand, even in the AQM approach the numerator and the denominator within the logarithm are estimated from a different set of parameters and as such they need not be consistent with each other under marginalization. The term resembles MI and ensuring consistency in such a framework would require either of the numerator or the denominator to be close to something like a variational approximation of the true distribution. In addition, AQM+ adopts the same framework as AQM but computes MI over some top-k of the random variables being considered. Could the authors comment more on why restricting the space of r.v.\u2019s to some top-k samples is a good idea? Would that not lead to somewhat of a biased estimator?\n- Unless I am missing something, training aprxAgen from the training data (indA) seems odd. Assuming, this to be Qbot\u2019s mental model of Abot -- there is no prior reason why this should be initialized or trained in such a manner. Similarly, the training paradigm of the depA setting is confusing. If they are trained in a manner similar to a regular Abot -- either SL or RL -- then they\u2019re not approximate mental models but are rather just another Abot agent in play which is being queried by Qbot.\n- Under Comparative Models, in paragraph 2 of section 4.1, the authors state that \u201cthere are some reports\u2026.looks like human\u2019s dialog\u201d. Can the authors elaborate on what they mean by this statement? It\u2019s not clear what the message to be conveyed here is.\n- Comparisons in GuessWhich highly rely on the PyTorch implementation in the mentioned github repository. However, the benchmarking performed in that repository for RL over SL is not accurate because of inherent bugs in the implementation of REINFORCE (see https://github.com/batra-mlp-lab/visdial-rl/issues/13 and https://github.com/batra-mlp-lab/visdial-rl/pull/12 ). I would suggest the authors to take this into account.\n- Can the authors also show performances for the GuessWhich models (under the AQM+ framework) on the original retrieval metrics for Visual Dialog mentioned in Das et al. (2017a)? This would be useful to judge the robustness of the proposed approach over the methods being compared with. \n\n\nUpdated Thoughts\n- The authors adressed the issues raised/comments made in the review. In light of my comments below to the author responses -- I am inclined towards increasing my rating.\n- In addition, I have mentioned some updates in the comments which might make the paper stronger -- centered around clarifications regarding the computation of the top-k info-gain term.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
