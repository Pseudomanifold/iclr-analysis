{"title": "An interesting paper on adversarial examples, but with certain concerns", "review": "This paper tried to analyze the high-dimensional geometry of adversarial examples from a geometric framework. The authors explained that there exists a tradeoff between being robust to different norms. They further proved that it is insufficient to learn robust decision boundaries by training against adversarial examples drawn from balls around the training set. Moreover, this paper showed that nearest neighbor classifiers do not suffer from this insufficiency.\n \nIn general, I think this paper is very interesting and enlightening. The authors analyzed the most robust boundary of norm 2 and norm infinity in different dimensions through a simple example and concluded that the single decision boundary cannot be robust in different norms. In addition, the author started from a special manifold and proposed a bound (ratio of two volumes) to prove the insufficiency of the traditional adversarial training methods and then extended to arbitrary manifold. It is good that this might provide a new way to evaluate the robustness of adversarial training method. However, I have some concerns: 1) Is it rigorous to define the bound by vol_X/vol_pi? In my opinion, the ratio of the volume of intersection (X^\\del and \\pi^\\del) and vol \\pi^\\del may be more rigorous? 2) I don't know if such bound can be useful or easily applied in other work? In my opinion, it might be difficult, since the volume itself appears difficult to calculate. \nI think the paper is a bit complicated or heavy in mathematics, and not easy to follow (though I believe I have well understood it). Some typos and minor issues are also listed as below. \n\nMinor concerns:\n1. At the end of the introduction, 3 attacking methods, FGSM, BIM, and PGD, should be given their full names and also citations are necessary.\n2. Could you provide a specific example to illustrate the bound in Eq. (3), e.g. in the case of d=3, k=1.\n3. In Page 7, \u201cFigure 4 (left) shows that this expression approaches 1 as the codimension (d-k) of Pi increases.\u201d  I think, the subfigure shows that the ratio approaches 1 when d and k are all increased.\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
