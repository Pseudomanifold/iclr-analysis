{"title": "An Submission Substantially Below Acceptance Bar", "review": "This paper proposed stacked U-Net for image segmentation. The main contribution as claimed by the authors is stacking multiple U-Net to repeat the high-low-high feature representation. \n\nGenerally speaking, the proposed idea is completely out-of-date as a submission for ICLR 2019. There are a large number of research works have been done to improve the first encoder-decoder design since 2016. Stacked multiple U-Nets to repeat the information concentration and recovering process is widely used as a standard design such as Hourglass network. I can hardly believe that this idea can be considered as significant for an ICLR submission in 2019.\n", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
