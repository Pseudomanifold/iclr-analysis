{"title": "Interesting architecture design, but the experiments are not convincing", "review": "This paper proposed an architecture similar to stacked hourglass network, while replacing each block with module similar to UNet. It is claimed to achieve competitive results while using much less parameters. Many techniques are adopted to improve its performance, e.g. skip connection, residual connection, 1 stride convolution, multi-grid dilation, ect. \n\nQuestions for experiment comparison:\n 1. As mentioned by authors the main task of this model is semantic segmentation instead of classification, so when comparing with the performance of ResNet101, especially borrowing the results from Chen et al. 2017's work, it would be better also comparing with the 'block5-7' results, instead of 'block4' solely. \n2. On MS-COCO dataset the experiment setting is slightly different (30k image more for training comapring with Chen et al. 2017). Thus the boost of accuracy is not very convincing.\n3. It has not outperform the state-of-the-art models on VOC2012 or Cityscapes.\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
