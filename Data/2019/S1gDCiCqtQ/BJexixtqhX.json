{"title": "A simple ideas works well in a challenging RL domain. The generalizability and significance can be improved if more domains can be tested", "review": "This paper proposed a model-free HRL method, which is combined with unsupervised learning methods, including abnormality discovery and clustering for subgoal discovery. In all, this paper studies a very important problem in RL and is easy to follow. The technique is sound. Although the novelty is not that significant (combining existing techniques), it showed good results on Montezuma\u2019 revenge, which is considered as a very challenging  problem for primitive action based RL.\n\nAlthough the results are impressive, I still have some doubt about the generalizability of the method. It might be helpful to improve its significance if more diversified domains can be tested.\n\nThe paper can be strengthen by providing some ablation test, for example, is performance under different K for Kmeans? \n\nAlso some important details seems missing, for example, the data used for kmeans, it is mentioned that the input to the controller is four consecutive frame of size 84x84, so the input data dimension is more than 10k, I guess some further dimensionality reduction technique has to be applied in order to run kmeans effectively.\n\nRegarding the comparisons, the proposed method is only compared with one primitive action based method. It might be better to include results from other HRL methods, such as Kulkarni et al.\n\nIs the curve based on the mean of different runs? It might be useful to include an errorbar to show the statistical significance.\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
