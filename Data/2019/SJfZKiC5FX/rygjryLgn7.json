{"title": "Simple and effective restoration approach ", "review": "Summary\n\nThis paper decomposes the image restoration task in two part: the restoration part handled by a restoration RNN, and the number of steps to apply the RNN is determined using a policy unit. \nState of the art results are achieved on blind grey level Gaussian noise denoising on the BSD68 dataset.\n\nThe approach is novel to my knowledge, the paper is well written, the results are good and well illustrated.\n\nQuestions:\n-It would be nice to present results on color images, and on datasets that contains natural noises.  \n-Lowering the learning rate on plateaus during training is done by hand or is there an automatic criterion to define the plateaus?\n\nMinor:\npage 1: extra \")\" after ref to Bredies et al 2010\ncould cite Chen, Zu, Koltun ICCV17 in deep models for restoration\nSeveral \"L\" have been replaced by \"_' e.g. under review at IC_R, R_-based, etc in the whole paper\np.4: rain-> train\ngreatly influence -> greatly influences\np5: typo performace\nmake a uniform bib: whole first name or abbr. , no URL, etc.\np6: the weight -> the set of weights \nadd the specification that the noise is Gaussian\nthe sentence \"the training set and testing set of ...\" is used twice, remove one.\np7 Table 1: the perf of DnCNN-B is 29.16 and not 29.15 for sigma 25, right?", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
