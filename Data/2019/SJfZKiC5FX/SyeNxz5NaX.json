{"title": "An improvement to the SoA of the domain, more explanations and analysis welcomed", "review": "The paper proposes a restoration method based on deep reinforcement learning. It is the idea of trainable unfolding that motivates the use of Reinforcement learning, the restoration unit is a SoA U-Net. \n\nRemarks\n\n* The author seems to make strong assumptions on the nature of the noise and made no attempt to understand the nature of the learning beyond a limited set of qualitative example and PSNR. \n\n* Even if the experimental protocol has been taken from prior work, it would have been appreciated to make it explicit in the paper, especially as ICLR is not a conference of image processing. Indeed, It would have made the paper more self-sufficient. \n\n* Second 2 describing the method is particularly hard to understand and would require more details. \n\n* In the experimental section, the authors claim that \"These results indicate that the restoration unit has the potential to generalize on unseen degradation levels when trained with good policies\". It would have been important to mention that such generalization capability seems to occur for the given noise type used in the experiments. I didn't see any explicit attempt to variate the shape of the noise to evaluate the generalization capability of the model.\n\nIn conclusion, the paper proposes an interesting method of image denoising through state of the art deep learning model and reinforcement learning algorithm. The main difference with the SoA on the domain is the use of a diffusion dynamics. IMHO, the paper would need more analysis and details on the mentioned section.\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
