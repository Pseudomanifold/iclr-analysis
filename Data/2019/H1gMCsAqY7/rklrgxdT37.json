{"title": "The paper proposes an idea of combining different size models together into one shared net. And the performance is claimed to be slightly worse for classification and much better for detection.", "review": "The idea is really interesting. One only need to train and maintain one single model, but use it in different platforms of different computational power.\n\nAnd according to the experiment results of COCO detection, the S-version models are much better than original versions (eg. faster-0.25x, from 24.6 to 30.0) . The improvement is huge to me. However the authors do not explain any deep reasons.\n\nAnd for classification, there are slightly performance drop instead of a large improvement which is also hard to understand. \n\nFor detection, experiments on depth-wise convolution based models (such as mobilenet and shufflenet) are suggested to make this work more solid and meaningful.\n\n", "rating": "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
