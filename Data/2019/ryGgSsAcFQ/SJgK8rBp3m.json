{"title": "Review of \"Deep, Skinny Neural Networks are not Universal Approximators\"", "review": "This paper proves a theoretical limitation of narrow-and-deep neural networks. It shows that, for any function that can be approximated by such networks, its level set (or decision boundary for binary classification) must be unbounded. The conclusion means that if some problem's decision boundary is a closed set, then it cannot be represented by such narrow networks.\n\nThe intuition is relatively simple. Under the assumptions of the paper, the neural network can always be approximated by a one-to-one mapping followed by a linear projection. The image of the one-to-one mapping is homeomorphic to R^n, so that it must be an open topological ball. The intersection of this open ball with a linear hyperplane must include the boundary of the ball, thus it extends to infinity in the original input space. The critical assumptions here, which guarantees the one-to-one property of the network, are: 1) the network is narrow, and 2) the activation function can be approximated by a one-to-one function.\n\nThe authors claim that 2) captures a large family of activation functions. However, it does exclude some popular activation families, such as the polynomial activation, which were proven effective in multiple areas. As a concrete example, the simple function f(x1,x2) = x_1^2 + x_2^2 has bounded level sets, but it can be represented by a narrow 2-layer neural network with the quadratic activation.\n\nOverall, I feel that the result is interesting but it depends on a strong assumption and doesn't capture all interesting cases. It is also not clear how this theoretical result can shed insight on the empirical study of neural networks. \n\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
