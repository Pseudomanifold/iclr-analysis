{"title": "Experiments and motivation can be improved", "review": "In this paper, the authors propose a method for optimizing quadratic penalties over non-convex loss functions. The authors motivate their approach by showing the complexity of training non-convex models with linear constraints and proposing a simpler method to introduce these constraints as regularization terms. Finally, they show how their proposed method compares to alternative solutions on a series of benchmarks.\n\nUse of double sampling method for estimating the loss and second order penalty appears to be novel, however, there is no discussion of the implications of using this method to train non-convex models --- one would suspect that use of double sampling may make the gradient descent susceptible to high variance. Simulation results in the paper only demonstrate how the use of the loss changes the solution but there is no discussion or experiments on complexity of training models that use this approach. This is particularly important because authors are claiming their method does not suffer from complexity issues which other methods suffer, but this claim is not supported by any evidence. For example, how many iterations were necessary to train the model? How sensitive is the training to initial conditions and changes in hyper parameters?\n\nAuthors motivate their method by pointing out the limitations of using fairness constraints in non-convex models, however, they don\u2019t provide-sufficient evidence for why non-convex models are actually useful in their experiments --- the datasets they used are small and models that are actually convex may perform just as good or nearly as good as highly non-linear, non-convex models which authors are trying to use.\n\nOverall, I would recommend the authors to improve the presentation by providing more context for the use of double sampling method and other relevant works in this area (at least showing the impact of using double sampling on training). Moreover, given the datasets and scope of questions related to fairness they need to provide better experiments that motivate the use of their method (compared to simpler methods) or consider other problems where their approach could be more useful. Given these considerations I believe this paper does not meet the standards for publication.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
