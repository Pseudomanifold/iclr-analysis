{"title": "An interesting form of \"imitation learning\".", "review": "This paper considered the idea of accelerating sampling process by exploring uncertainty of rewards. The authors claimed more efficient sampling by building a reference policy and an exploration policy. Algorithm was tested on grids and Atari games.\n\nThe authors proposed eDQN, which is more like exploring the uncertainty of Q values instead of rewards. The reviewer is also expecting to see the convergence guarantee of eDQN.\n\nThe paper is well-organized and easy to understand. Written errors didn't influence understanding.\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
