{"title": "extension of multi-scale network, and expected good results", "review": "The big-little module is an extension of the multi-scale module. Different scales takes different complexities: higher complexity for low-scale, and lower complexity for high scale. Two schemes of merging two branches are also discussed, and the linear combination is empirically better. \n\nAs expected, the results are better than ResNets, ResNexts, SEResNexts. I do not have  comments except ablation study is needed to show the results for more choices of alpha, beta, e.g., alpha =1, beta =1.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
