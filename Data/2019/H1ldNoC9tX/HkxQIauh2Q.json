", "review": "This paper studied classification problem, with Positive, Unlabeled and biased Negative labeled data. The paper presents a two-step method, where the first-step is instance weighting and the second-step is standard binary classification. The paper shows theoretical proofs on the error estimation. Experiments on several well-known data sets are conducted and compared. \n\nThe good things of the paper are clear. \n\n1.\tTechnical sound with statistical foundation\n2.\tTheoretical foundation\n3.\tProblem is general\n4.\tPaper is general well written.\n\nSome weak points as well\n1.\tApplication value is not so big, as there is no real application problem and the experiments are based on simulation.\n2.\tAlthough the studied problem is reasonable, the setup is a bit too general and need rather strict condition to have a good method. \n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
