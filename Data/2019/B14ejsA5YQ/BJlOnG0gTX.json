{"title": "An interesting approach ; some concerns regarding assumptions and experiments", "review": "The paper proposes an approach to learn nonlinear causal relationship from time series data that is based on empirical risk minimization regularized by mutual information.  The mutual information at the minimizer of the objective function  is used as causal measure.\nThe paper is well written and the proposed method well motivate and intuitive. \n\nHowever I am concerned by the assumption that the lagged variables X_{t-1}^{(j)} follow a diagonal gaussian distribution. This appears to be very restrictive, since typically the values of time series j at time t-1 are typically depending say of those that time t-2, t-3 etc.\n\nAnother key concern concerns scalability.  The authors mention gene regulatory networks , neuroscience etc as key applications. Yet the experiments considered in the paper are limited to very few time series. For instance the simulation experiments use  N=30,  which is much smaller than the number of time series usually involved say in gene regulatory network data.  The real data experiments use N= 6 or N=2. This is way to small. \n\nThe real data experiments (sections 4.2 and 4.3) are not very convincing, not only because of the very small size of N, but also because there is no comparison with the other approaches.  How do these compare? Does the proposed approach offer  insights on these datasets which are not captured by the comparison methods?", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
