{"title": "A easy-to-follow paper on nonlinear Granger causality which requires some further clarification", "review": "This paper aims to estimate time-delayed, nonlinear causal influences from time series under the causal sufficiency assumption. It is easy to follow and contains a lot of empirical results. Thanks for the results, but I have several questions.\n\nFirst, In Theorem 2, which seems to be a main result of the paper, the authors were concerned with the condition when W_{ji} >0, but there is not conclusion if W_{ji} =0. In order to correctly estimate causal relations from data, both cases must be considered.\n\nSecond, the conclusion of Theorem 2 seems to be flawed. Let me try to make it clear with the following example. Suppose x^1_{t-2} directly causes x^2_{t-1} and that x^2_{t-1} directly causes x^3_{t}, without a direct influence from x^1_{t-2}  to x^3_{t}. Then when minimizing (2), we have the following results step by step:\n1) The noise standard deviation in x^2_{t-1}, denoted by \\eta_2, may be non-zero. This is because we minimize a tradeoff of the prediction error (the first term in (2)) and a function of the reciprocal of the noise standard deviation \\eta_2 (the second term in (2)), not only the prediction error.\n2) If \\eta_2 is non-zero, then x^1_{t-2} will be useful for the purpose of predicting x^3_{t}. (Note that if \\eta_2 is zero, then x^1_{t-2} is not useful for predicting x^3_{t).) From the d-separation perspective, this is because x^1_{t-2} and x^3_{t} are not d-separated by x^2_{t-1} + \\eta_2 \\cdot \\epsilon_2, although they are d-separated by x^2_{t-1}. Then the causal Markov condition tells use that x^1_{t-2} and x^3_{t} are not independent conditional on x^2_{t-1} + \\eta_2 \\cdot \\epsilon_2, which means that x^1_{t-2} is useful for predicting x^3_{t}.\n3) Given that x^1_{t-2} is useful for predicting x^3_{t}, when (2) is minimized, \\eta_1 will not go to infinity, resulting in a non-zero W_{13), which *mistakenly* tells us that X^{1}_{t-1} directly structurally causes x^{(3)}_t.\n\nThis illustrates that the conclusion of Theorem 2 may be wrong.  I believe this is because the proof of Theorem 2 is flawed in lines 5-6 on Page 16. It does not seem sensible to drop X^{j}_{t-1} + \\eta_X \\cdot \\epsilon_X and attain a smaller value of the cost function at the same time. Please carefully check it, especially the argument given in lines 10-13.\n\nThird, it is rather surprising that the authors didn't mention anything about the traditional causal discovery methods based on conditional independence relations in the data, known as constraint-based methods, such as the PC algorithm (Spirtes et al., 1993), IC algorithm (Pearl, 2000), and FCI (Spirtes et al., 1993). Such methods are directly applicable to time-delayed causal relations by further considering the constraint that effects temporally follow the causes. \n\nFourth, please make it clear that the proposed method aims to estimate \"causality-in-mean\" because of the formulation in terms of regression. For instance, if x^j_{t-1} influences only the variance of x^i_{t}, but not its mean, then the proposed method may not detect such a causal influence, although the constraint-based methods can.\n\nAny response would be highly appreciated.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
