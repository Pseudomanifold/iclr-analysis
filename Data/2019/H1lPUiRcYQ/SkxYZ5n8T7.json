{"title": "Interesting application paper, somewhat incremental improvement over prior work", "review": "This paper looks at the problem of computing committor functions, which is defined as the probability a state first visits a local minimum of the energy landscape in Langevin dynamics. The authors motivates the problem well by explaining why this is difficult to compute. Khoo et al, 2018 uses a deep network to variationally approximate this function. The major contribution of this paper is several improvements to the techniques of Khoo et al. I will comment on each of the improvements in turn. \n\nIn section 3.1 the authors proposes that instead of using optimization to satisfy boundary condition, it might be better to parameterize the function to satisfy the boundary condition. This contribution seems incremental. Eq.(9) guarantees satisfaction of the boundary conditions when lambda is large enough, so I imagine that lambda is not very difficult to pick. Therefore, the practical reason to use the more sophisticated parameterization is unclear. The new proposal removes a hyper-parameter lambda, but introduces new hyper-parameters epsilon and the exact smoothing for the two functions X_A, X_B.\n\nThe contribution in 3.2 seems interesting. The authors replace the original sampling function, which has high variance, with importance sampling. It seems that importance sampling is very well suited for this problem, and the authors found a very natural and reasonable proposal distribution. This method is generally interesting for estimating the expectation of any random variable with respect to a Boltzmann distribution.\n\nIn section 3.3 the authors proposes to work on a feature space. This is interesting to audience interested in the specific applications. But for machine learning this is a standard procedure, so has limited methodology novelty. \n\nOne issue of this paper is limited audience in ICLR. It seems much more appropriate to submit to statistical physics, material science or other relevant communities. I am not capable to judge the significance of this paper to those communities. As an application paper, the proposed methods are somewhat incremental; I only find section 3.2 interesting to a broader audience. \n\nWriting:\nI like the writing. Everything symbol is defined before use, and the notation is clean and unambiguous. I can easily follow the author\u2019s arguments down to the minor details. \n\nA minor improvement to section 2 is to first explain the shortcoming of Eq.(5), then introduce Eq.(6)(7). \n\nEq.(11) can be better explained. The definition doesn\u2019t look like a smooth function, and it takes some time to figure out what the authors mean here. \n\nMinor comments:\nA, B \\in \\Omega should be A, B \\subset \\Omega in Section 2\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
