{"title": "The paper studies how perturbations in 3D shape/texture may be used to generate adversarial inputs.  Evaluation is done on densenet, inception-v3 nets.   Other aspects covered include - the specification of a 3D smoothing loss to describe degree of perturbations in the mesh, the study of transferability of adversarial meshes  among different rendering schemes , etc.", "review": "\nPros:  Studies how perturbations in 3D shape and albedo maps may be used to generate adversarial inputs and evaluates them on densenet and Inception-v3 nets.   \n\nCons:  The paper should be checked for sentence structure, typos, etc. There are a number of places with linguistic errors.  The paper is hard to read.  The claims in the contributions section (in page 2) are not adequately supported by extensive experimentation.  For instance, the section claims that an in-depth analysis of vulnerable regions in 3D meshes is done in the paper and the discussion in the paper is mainly about a case study visualizing the vertex flow in the given mesh region. While the authors try to cover reasonable ground in terms of studying how adversarial data can be generated starting from mesh data,   a systematic in-depth study of each of the factors outlined in the contribution section will strengthen the paper and could offer insights into how the work can be used to improve robustness of classification.  \n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
