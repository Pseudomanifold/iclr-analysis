{"title": "review", "review": "This paper focuses on introducing an application of generative adversarial model in generating irradiated material images, where alloy material features are extracted as vector to serve as prior information for the generation. Along with this paper, the authors also introduced a dataset of 22000 irradiated images with 22,143 sets of corresponding parameters.\nHere are the evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work.\n\nQuality: \n1) this paper is poorly written, with typos and errors here and there, e.g., \"some researchs\", \"methods... which has replaced\", \"Attn(\\cdot)\" vs \"Att(\\cdot)\", etc. \n2) Most variables are mentioned in the introduction section but not defined. Some of them are defined in later section but some are never defined.  The shape of these variables also need to be defined.\n3) The author should explain many concepts that are only familiar to some domain, e.g., \"cavity\", \"swelling cavities distribution\". Although they were mentioned in introduction and highlighted as important concepts, I am still confused what \"cavity\" refers to even finish reading this paper.\n4) The quality of all figures are extremely low! Especially Fig 3 which suppose to show performance comparison! I am shocked to see these figures in an ICLR submission.\n\nClarity:\nThe paper is not clearly structured and presented. Also the formulations are not fully motivated. For example, why the latent variables follow this prior distribution? Any explanation for the choice? \n\nOriginality:\ngenerative models for image, material, molecule generation has been studied for years. The model is not novel. The data is new, but less interesting than the publicly available molecular data repo, such as ZINC. \n\n \n", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
