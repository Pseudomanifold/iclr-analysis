{"title": "Interesting idea, but difficult to read", "review": "This paper presents a new framework to describe and understand the dynamics of RNNs inspired by quantum physics. The authors also propose a novel RNN architecture derived by their analysis. \n \nAlthough I found the idea quite interesting, my main concern is that the jargon used in the paper makes it hard to understand. I suggest that the authors to add an in-depth \"background\" section, so the reader becomes more familiar with the terms that will be introduced later. \n \nDespite this paper is mainly a theory paper, it would have a lot more strength if the authors provide some experiments to demonstrate the strength of the proposed architecture over LSTMs. \n \nAs a minor suggestion, the term \"universal\" should be removed from \"UNIVERSAL COMPUTING NEURAL NETWORK\" as all recurrent neural networks are, in theory, universal. \n\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}
