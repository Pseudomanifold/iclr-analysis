{"title": "Good paper with detailed experiments, but the idea seems lacking novelty", "review": "Major Contribution:\nThe paper introduces a method that combines the advantage and of model-based RL and imitation learning and offset their weakness. The method proposes a probabilistic inference approach to analyze the action of the model.\n\nOrganization/Style:\nThe paper is well written, organized, and clear on most points. \n\nTechnical Accuracy:\nI'm not an expert in RL. The method is obscure to me, but from my point of view, the experiments are done quite thoroughly and the results look good.\n\nPresentation:\nGood. \n\nAdequacy of Citations: \nThe author should consider adding the related works include:\nBojarski, Mariusz, et al. \"End to end learning for self-driving cars.\": using CNNs to implement imitation learning for self-driving cars\n\nMultimedia:\nVideos are helpful to understand the method and are well composed.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess"}
