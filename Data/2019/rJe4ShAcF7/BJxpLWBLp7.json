{"title": "Implementation trick to reduce memory footprint of transformer / experiments on music generation", "review": "This paper presents an implementation trick to reduce the memory footprint of relative attention within a transformer network. Specifically, the paper points out redudant computation and storage in the traditional implementation and re-orders matrix operations and indexing schemes to optimize. As an appllication, the paper applies the new implementation to music modeling and generation. By reducing the memory footprint, the paper is able to train the transformer with relative attention on longer musical sequences and larger corpora. The experimental results are compelling -- the transformer with relative attention outperforms baselines in terms of perplexity on development data (though test performance is not reported) and by manual evaluation in a user study.\n\nOverall, I'm uncomfortable accepting this paper in its current form because I'm not sure it constitutes a large enough unit of novel work. The novelty here, as far as I can tell, is essentially an implementation trick rather than an algorithm or model. Transformer networks have been applied to music in past work -- the only difference here is that because of the superior implementation the model can be trained from larger musical sequences. All that said, I do think the proposed implementation is useful and that the experimental results are compelling. Clearly, when trained from sufficient data, transformer networks have something to offer that is different from past techniques.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
