{"title": "Good but novelty concerns", "review": "This review will be short considering the current state of the paper and the reviews. I would just like to note to the authors that a somewhat similar piece of work was done in \"Learning Locomotion Skills Using DeepRL: Does the Choice of Action Space Matter?\". The authors optimized muscle insertion locations as part of their results. There is also an abstract on the topic that learns how to add links and morphology in \"Real-time motion generation for imaginary creatures using hierarchical reinforcement learning\".\n\nBest of luck, look forward to seeing more work.\n\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
