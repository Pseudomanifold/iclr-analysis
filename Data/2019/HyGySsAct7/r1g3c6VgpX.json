{"title": "Evaluation is weak", "review": "This paper proposes a black-box attack on multi-word ASR systems.  Most work on black-box attacks have focused on tasks in vision. This work adds to the literature on attac\nks on speech systems. The key novelties are the handling of a loss function over multiple decodings as well as the use of novel genetic algorithms to generate the adversari\nal examples.\n\nA weakness of this paper is that they do not compare to the closely related Alzantot et al. work. While the latter is focused on single word settings and is thus solving an\n easier problem, what would happen if the Alzantot et al. method was applied to each\n\n\nWhile the idea is interesting but incremental, the evaluation of the approach is weak.\n\n1. Insted of choosing random pairs of words as target phrases, it would be interesting to pick phrases that are likely to occur in English and to ask how success rate varie\ns as a function of the initial phrase and target phrase.\n\n2. To confirm that the resulting adversarial examples are similar to audio samples in the original dataset, the authors should do user studies. This is a key component in e\nvaluating the efficacy of such attacks. The cross correlation is useful but does not get at perceptual similarity.\n\n3. Table 1 is not useful since either the datasets are different or information is not given on the specific white box attacks.\n\n4. Does increasing the iterations lead to a higher success rate as claimed at end of page 7?\n\n\nAbstract:\n1. This sentence is misleading : \"Current work..are known\" given the Alzantot et al. work focuses on black-box attacks.\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
