{"title": "Interesting, but there are some unclear issues", "review": "This paper proposes to generalize both BN and cBN using Whitening and Coloring based batch normalization. Whitening is an enhanced version of mean subtraction and normalization by standard deviation. Coloring is an enhanced version of per-dimension scaling and shifting.\nEvaluation experiments are conducted on different datasets and using different GAN networks and training protocols. Empirical results show improvements over BN and cBN.\n\nThe proposed method WC is interesting, but there are some unclear issues.\n\n1. Two motivations for this paper: BN improves the conditioning of the Jacobian, stability of GAN training is related to the conditioning of the Jocobian. These motivate the paper to develop enhanced versions of BN/cBN, as said in the introduction. More discussions why WC can further improve the conditioning over ordinary BN would be better.\n\n2. It is not clear why WC performs better than W_zca C (Table 3), though the improvement is moderate. The difference is that WC uses Cholesky decomposition and ZCA uses eigenvalue decomposition. Compared to W_zca C, WC seems to be an incremental contribution.\n\n3. It is not clear why the proposed method is much faster than ZCA-based whitening.\n\n===========  comments after reading response ===========\n\nThe authors make a good response, which clarifies the unclear issues from my first review. I remove the mention of the concurrent submission.\n\nSpecially, the new Appendix D with the new Fig. 4 clearly explains and shows the benefit of WC over W_zca.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}
