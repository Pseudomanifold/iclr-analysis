{"title": "Paper badly written and very little contribution", "review": "This paper precomputes skip-thought vectors and then feeds it into several types of GANs to use the skip-though decoder on generated samples of skip-thought vectors.\n\nThe contribution of this paper is almost trivial which is worsen by truly bad writing and questionable experiments. Paper does not provide any comparison to previous work.\n\nThe paper seems to be written in rush:\n- no conclusion nor summary\n- the introduction does not properly introduce nor motivate this work\n- experiment description is very scarce and not sufficient for understanding (what is the metric? how to compute it? why is it reasonable? only a couple of questions paper should have answered)\n\nAnd minor points:\n- many citations are missing the year (I suggest to add \"circa ...\" if it is unknown)\n- strange question marks on p3\n- references to Tables 2a-d seem to be broken", "rating": "2: Strong rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
