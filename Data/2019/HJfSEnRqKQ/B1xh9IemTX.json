{"title": "Interesting novel Active Learning setting", "review": "The authors introduce a new Active Learning setting where instead of querying for a label for a particular example, the oracle offers a partial or weak label. This leads to a simpler and more natural way of retrieving this information that can be of use many applications such as image classification. \n\nThe paper is well-written and very easy to follow. The authors first present the overview of the learning scenario and then suggest three sampling strategies based on the existing AL insights (expected information gain, expected remaining classes, expected decrease in classes). \n\nAs the labels that the algorithm has to then use are partial, they make use of a standard algorithm to learn from partial labels -- namely, minimizing a partial log loss. It would be nice to properly reference related methods in the literature in Sec. 2.1.\n\nThe way of solving both the learning from partial labels and the sampling strategies are not particularly insightful. Also, there is a lack of theoretical guarantees to show value of a partial label as compared to the true label. However, as these are not the main points of the paper (introduction of a novel learning setting), I see these as minor concerns.\n\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
