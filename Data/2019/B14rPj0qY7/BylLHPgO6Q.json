{"title": "The paper showed the benefit of the proposed multi-task architecture, but not novel enough for ICLR level", "review": "This paper presents one end-to-end multi-task learning architecture for depth & segmentation map estimation and the driving prediction. The whole architecture is composed of two components, the first one is the  perception module (segmentation and depth map inference), the second one is the driving decision module. The training process is sequential, initially train the perception module, then train the driving decision task with freezing the weights of the perception module. The author evaluated the proposed approach on one simulated dataset, Experimental results demonstrated the advantage of multi-task compared to the single task. \n\nAdvantages:\nThe pipeline is also easy to understand, it is simple and efficient based on the provided results.\nThe proposed framework aims to give better understanding of the application of deep learning in self-driving car project. Such as the analysis and illustration in Figure 3. \n\nQuestions:\nThere are several typos needed to be addressed. E.g, the question mark in Fig index of section 5.1. There should be comma in the second sentence at the last paragraph of section 5.2.  \nMulti-task, especially the segmentation part is not novel for self-driving car prediction, such as Xu et al. CVPR\u2019 17 paper from Berkeley. The experiment for generalization shows the potential advancement, however, it is less convincing with the limited size of the evaluation data, The authors discussed about how to analyze the failure causes, however, if the perception  learning model does not work well, then it would be hard to analyze the reason of incorrectly prediction.\n\nIn general, the paper has the merits and these investigations may be helpful for this problem, but it is not good enough for ICLR.\n\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
