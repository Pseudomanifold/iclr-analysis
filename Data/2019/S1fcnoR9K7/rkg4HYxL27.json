{"title": "Interesting method, but more experimental results are needed", "review": "In this paper the authors propose a method called \u201cAll learning rates at once\u201d (Alrao) which aims to save the time needed to tune learning rate for DNN models testing. The method sets individual learning rate to each feature in each layer of a network using the values sampled from truncated log-uniform distribution. The only cost of the method is the creation of several branches of the classifier layer. Each of the branches is trained with a predefined learning rate value, and the final predictions are obtained by model averaging. In the presented experiments Alrao demonstrates performance comparable to SGD with optimal learning rate and more stable results compared to Adam. The authors indicate limitations of Alrao caused by the overhead in the final layer which complicates the application of the method for models with large classifier layer.\n\nOverall, the paper is written clearly and organized well. However, Equation (2) needs to be corrected. The denominator in the normalizing constant of log-uniform distribution should be \\log\\eta_{max} - \\log\\eta_{min}.\n\nMy main concern is related to the experimental evaluation of the method. I find the experimental evidence for the effectiveness of Alrao insufficient. As the authors propose to employ the method to quickly evaluate models and select best models to further training it would be beneficial to have more results in order to ensure that the method is reliable in this setting. Other demonstrations which would show possibly that the method enhances performance of architecture search methods may emphasize significance of the proposed method. Also, more experiments comparing Alrao against sampling learning rates per weight are needed. Given the current results, it is still unclear whether the proposed method performs better. Finally, I recommend to include comments explaining how much more time is needed in practice to train model with Alrao compared to SGD training.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
