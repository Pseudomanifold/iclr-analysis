{"title": "Deep Hazard Modeling with Mixture of Distributions ", "review": "This paper proposes to use a mixture of distributions for hazard modeling. They use the standard censored loss and binning-based discretization for handling irregularities in the time series. \n\nThe evaluation is quite sub-par. Instead of reporting the standard ranking/concordance metrics, the authors report the accuracy of binary classification in certain future timestamps ahead. If we are measuring the classification accuracy, there is a little justification for using survival analysis; we could use just a classification algorithm instead. Moreover, the authors do not compare to the many existing deep hazard model such as Deep Survival [1], DeepSurv [2], DeepHit [3], or many variations based on deep point process modeling. The authors also don\u2019t report the result for non-mixture versions, so we cannot see the true advantages of the proposed mixture modeling.\n\nA major baseline for mixture modeling is always non-parametric modeling. In this case, given that there are existing works on deep Cox hazard modeling, the authors need to show the advantages of their proposed mixture modeling against deep Cox models.\n\nOverall, the methodology in this paper is quite limited and the evaluation is non-standard. Thus, I vote for rejection of the paper.\n\n\n[1] Ranganath, Rajesh, et al. \"Deep Survival Analysis.\" Machine Learning for Healthcare Conference. 2016.\n\n[2] Katzman, Jared L., et al. \"DeepSurv: personalized treatment recommender system using a Cox proportional hazards deep neural network.\" BMC medical research methodology 18.1 (2018): 24.\n\n[3] Lee, Changhee, et al. \"Deephit: A deep learning approach to survival analysis with competing risks.\" AAAI, 2018.", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
