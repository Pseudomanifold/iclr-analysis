{"title": "A functional version of Riemannian Langevin dynamics is used in order to perform inference with Bayesian neural networks. It is not quite convincing due to a lack of effort in explaining the approach.", "review": "The idea of extending  Riemannian Langevin dynamics to functional spaces is elegant, however it is extremely hard to follow the proposed method as details are kept to a minimum. The finite approximation of the posterior distribution is a function of the parameters theta, however it displays parameters lambda. The couple of sentences: \"Then by sampling \u03bb, we sample a functional f equivalently. The Riemannian Langevin dynamics on the functional space can thus be written as: (6)\" come without a single explanation.\n\nMinor comments\n* Max and Whye is the casual version for reference Welling and Teh.\n* proper nouns in References should be capitalized", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}
