{"title": "not clear about the originality", "review": "This paper proposes a spontaneous and self-organizing communication learning scheme in multi-agent RL setup. The problem is interesting. I mainly have one concern regarding its originality.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, it's not clear to me that there's much novelty in this approach.  I guess it might be the case the focus of the paper is to propose a framework or scheme. However, almost all the ingredients/components are standard.\n\nRegarding clarity, it's not clear to me:\n* how the structure from Figure 2 can be reproduced. \n* how statistically significant the evaluation results are.
