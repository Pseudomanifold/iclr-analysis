{"title": "interesting methods, ok results", "review": "The paper investigates the use of multi-objective optimization techniques in GAN-setups where there are multiple discriminators. Using multiple discriminators was proposed in Durugkar et al, Arora et al, Neyshabur et al and others. The twist here is to focus on the Pareto front and to import multiple gradient descent and hypervolume-maximization based methods into GANs. \n\nThe results are decent. The authors find that optimizing with respect to multiple discriminators increases diversity of samples for a computational cost. However, just scaling up (and carefully optimizing), can yield extremely impressive samples, https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.11096. It is unclear how the tradeoffs in optimizing against multiple discriminators stack-up against bigger GANs. \n\nFrom my perspective, the paper is interesting because it introduces new methods into GANs from another community. However, the results themselves are not sufficient for publication. \n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
