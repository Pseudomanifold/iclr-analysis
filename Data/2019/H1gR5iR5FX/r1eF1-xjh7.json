{"title": "Interesting dataset, but the evaluation and comparison need to be improved", "review": "This paper presents a new synthetic dataset to evaluate the mathematical reasoning ability of sequence-to-sequence models. It consists of math problems in various categories such as algebra, arithmetic, calculus, etc. The dataset is designed carefully so that it is very unlikely there will be any duplicate between train/test split and the difficulty can be controlled. Several models including LSTM, LSTM + Attention, Transformer are evaluated on the proposed dataset. The result showed some interesting insights about the evaluated models. The evaluation of mathematical reasoning ability is an interesting perspective. However, the un-standard design of the LSTM models makes it unclear whether the comparisons are solid enough. \n\nThe paper is relatively well-written, although the description of the neural models can be improved. \n\nThe generation process of the dataset is well thought out. The insights from the analysis of the failure cases are intriguing, but it also points out that the neural networks models are not really performing mathematical reasoning since the generalization is very limited. \n\nOne suggestion is that it might be useful to also release the structured (parsed) form besides the freeform inputs and outputs, for analysis and for evaluating structured neural network models like the graph networks. \n\nMy main concerns are about the evaluation and comparison of standard neural models. The use of \u201cblank inputs (referred to as \u201cthinking steps\u201d)\u201d in \u201cSimple LSTM\u201d and \u201cAttentional LSTM\" doesn\u2019t seem to be a standard approach. In the attentional LSTM, the use of \u201cparse LSTM\u201d is also not a standard approach in seq2seq models and doesn\u2019t seem to work well in the experiment (similar result to \u201cSimple LSTM\"). I think these issues are against the goal of evaluating standard neural models on the benchmark and will raise doubts about the comparison between different models. \n\nWith some improvements in the evaluation and comparison, I believe this paper will be more complete and much stronger. \n\ntypo:\npage 3: \u201cfreefrom inputs and outputs\u201d -> \u201cfreeform inputs and outputs\u201d\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
