{"title": "Interesting idea, however, more explanations needed. ", "review": "This paper proposes a method to use weighted Frechet Mean (wFM) for the operation on Manifold valued data for CNN. The novel point is to view wFM as a convolutional layer. Overall, this paper is mathematically well written, however, how each theory improves CNN and the model used in experiments are not clear enough. \n\nPros\n+ The use of wFM instead of a convolutional layer is an interesting idea. \n+ This paper is mathematically well written. \n\nCos \n- It is hard to understand how each theory presented in this paper helps to improve CNN. For example, the invariance to group operation. Some experimental results would help to understand the advantage of the group invariance.\n\n- It is also unclear why the authors constructed the invariant last layer although the inputs of the last layer are invariant under group operations. \n\n- In the introduction section, the authors raised the omnidirectional camera, diffusion magnetic resonance imaging, elastography as examples of manifold-valued data. However, experiments are limited to standard video sequences. \n\n- It is unclear how to obtain the weights {w_i} of wFM by backpropagation. \n\n- Since the contribution of this paper is to to use wFM instead of a convolutional layer, it is more interesting to visualize the weights {w_i}. \n\n- More explanation needs for the model used for experiments. Especially in dimensional reduction experiments, I could not understand how each subspace is obtained and averaged. If each frame is a subspace, by averaging frames, the reconstruction would be blurred. \n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
