{"title": "review for Curiosity-Driven Experience Prioritization via Density Estimation", "review": "The paper proposes a novel method for sampling examples for experience replay. It addresses the problem of having inbalanced data (in the experience buffer during training). The authors trained a density model and replay the trajectories that has a low density under the model. \n\nNovelty:\n\nThe approach is related to prioritized experience replay, PER is computational expensive because of the TD error update, in comparison, CDR only updates trajectory density once per trajectory.\n\nClarity:\n\nThe paper seems to lack clarity on certain design/ architecture/ model decisions.  For example, the authors did not justify why VGMM model was chosen and how does it compare to other density estimators.  Also, I had to go through a large chunk of the paper before coming across the exact setup. I think the paper could benefit from having this in the earlier sections.\n\n\nOther comments about the paper:\n\n-  I do like the idea of the paper. It also seems that curiosity in this context seems to be very related to surprise? There are neuroscience evidence indicating that humans turns to remember (putting more weights) on events that are more surprising.\n\n- The entire trajectory needs to be stored, so the memory wold grow with episode length. I could see this being an issue when episode length is too long.\n\n\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
