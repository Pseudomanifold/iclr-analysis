{"title": "Novelty is limited. No comparison with SOTA models", "review": "This paper proposes to improve the chemical compound generation by the Bayes optimization strategy, not by the new models. \nThe main proposal is to use the acquisition that switches the function based on the violation of a constraint, estimated via a BNN. \n\nI understand that the objective function, J_{comp}^{QED} is newly developed by the authors, but not intensively examined in the experiments. \nThe EIC, and the switching acquisition function is developed by (Schonlau+ 1998; Gelbard, 2015). \nSo I judge the technical novelty is somewhat limited. \n\nIt is unfortunate that the paper lacks intensive experimental comparisons with \"model assumption approaches\". \nMy concern is that the baseline is rely on the SMILE strings. \nIt is well known that the string-based generators are much weaker than the graph-based generators. \nIn fact, the baseline model is referred as \"CVAE\" in (Jing+, 2018) and showed very low scores against other models. \n\nThus, we cannot tell that these graph-based, \"model-assumption\" approaches are truly degraded in terms of the validity and the variety of generated molecules, \ncompared to those generated by the proposed method. \nIn that sense, preferable experimental setting is that to \ntest whether the constrained Bayesian optimization can boost the performance of the graph-based SOTA models. \n\n\n+ Showing that we can improve the validity the modification of the acquisition functions\n- Technical novelty is limited. \n- No comparison with SOTA models in \"graph-based, model assumption approaches\". \n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
