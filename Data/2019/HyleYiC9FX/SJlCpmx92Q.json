{"title": "Interesting results but need more experiments and clearer explanation", "review": "This paper proposed a retrieval model based on the residual network and evaluated the use of ELMo word embedding with/without IDF weight. The results showed that there are significant gain when adding the residual network on top of the word embedding. \n\nPros:\n* This work set a strong baseline for the retrieving target paragraph for question answering on the SQuAD dataset.\n* The experiments were sounds and leverage interesting points -- the use of word embedding itself as the feature representation didn't have as much impact to retrieval performance as the distance function.\n* The studied problem -- retrieval for answering question rather than getting the most relevant document worth more attention.\n\nCons:\n* The motivation of using the word embedding and contextual word embedding over the TF-IDF feature wasn't clear. Results on using simple feature like TF-IDF maybe useful to give readers better judgement of the use of word embedding.\n* The choice of dataset, SQuAD over more retrieval based QA like TrivialQA also wasn't strongly motivated. Also, it would be nice to see how the QA result would be improve with better retrieval model. \n* Another use of TF-IDF/IDF and embedding is to use TF-IDF/IDF to identify the related document and then use word embedding to resolve semantic ambiguity. Do you have theoretical/empirical reason why this shouldn\u2019t be considered?\n\nComment on writing:\n    - In Section 3.1: the dimension of the tensor should reflect the meaning (vocab size, embedding size or the number of documents) rather than numbers.\n    - In Section 3.1: since the weighting for each document is not shared, it would be clearer to just use M and W for each document instead of M\u2019, W'\n    - In Section 3.1: Evaluation metrics, e.g., recall@k, ROC, AUC; technical details, for example, tensor dimension, optimizer hyperparameters should be moved to the experiment section", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
