{"title": "Bias-reduced uncertainty estimation for deep neural classifiers", "review": "This paper presents an improved method for uncertainty estimation in deep neural networks, based on  their observations that the confidence scores based on highly confident points and low confidence points would be quite different. \n\nThe paper is in general well presented. The proposed method is well motivated (as in section 5). The results of the AES algorithm support well the proposed idea, which nevertheless looks simple. \n\nSection 3 needs further improvement in clarity. \n\nFigure 1 needs to be better presented. \n\nFigure 2(a) - please make the curves color-blind friendly. \n\nSGD (stochastic gradient descent?) needs to be defined, and you can't assume everybody knows what it is.
