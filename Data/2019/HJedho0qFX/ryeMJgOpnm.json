{"title": "Rough idea. The proposed relationship is not properly confirmed.", "review": "The authors propose a new method of measuring a knowledge within the learned CNN: the representations of CNN layers and word2vec embeddings and compared, and the similarity between them are calculate. The authors claim that the similarity score increases with learning time, and the higher layers of CNN have more similarity to word2vec embeddings than the lower layers..\n\nCNN and word2vec use different datasets. CNN uses the vision pixels and word2vec uses the words in the sentences. A certain amount of representation patterns can be expected to be shared, but surely the extent is limited (correlation 0.9 in Fig. 1). Because of this limitation, the proposed similarity measure must not be claimed as the measure of knowledge accumulation in CNN. \n\nIn addition, the authors have to be precise in defining the measure and provide the information captured by the measure. In the literature, I can see \u201csomething\u201d is shared by the two algorithms but do not know what is this \u201csomething.\u201d The authors claim that \u201csemantics\u201d are shared, but replacing \u201csemantics\u201d to \u201csomething\u201d does not make any difference in this manuscript. Further investigations and confirmations are needed to report which information is actually similar to each other.\n\nMinor: the 1 vs. 2 accuracy measure is not defined.\n\nIn summary, the proposed measure may capture some information but the explanation about this information is unclear. The information seems to be a rough similar pattern of concept representations. Further rigorous investigation of the proposed measure is necessary to confirm which information is captured. The current version is not sufficient for acceptance.\n", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
