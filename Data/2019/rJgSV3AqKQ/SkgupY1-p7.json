{"title": "A technical report rather than a research paper", "review": "General:\nIn general, this looks like a technical report rather than a research paper to me. Most parts of the paper are about the empirical analysis of adaptive algorithms and hyper-gradient methods. The contribution of the paper itself is not sufficient to be accepted.\n\nPossible Improvements:\n1. The study of such optimization problem should consider incorporating mathematics analysis with necessary proof. e.g. show the convergence rate under specific constraints. Even the paper is based on others' work, the author(s) could have extended their work by giving stronger theory analysis or experiment results.\n2. Since this is an experimental-based paper, besides CIFAR10 and MNIST data sets, the result would be more convincing if the experiments were also done on ImageNet(probably should also try deeper neural networks).\n3. The sensitivity study is interesting but the experiment results are not very meaningful to me. It would be better if the author(s) gave a more detailed analysis.\n4. The paper could be more consistent. i.e. emphasize the contribution of your own work and be more logical. I might miss something, but I feel quite confused about what is the main idea after reading the paper. \n\nConclusion:\nI believe the paper has not reached the standard of ICLR. Although we need such paper to provide analysis towards existing methods, the paper itself is not strong enough.", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
