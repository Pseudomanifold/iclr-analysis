{"title": "Paper proposes multi-agent sequential generative models. This is influential beyond toy simulations presented in the paper.", "review": "Very strong paper, building on top of variational RNNs for multi-agent sequential generation. Dialogue use case is mentioned in Discussion is indeed very exciting. The approach extends VRNN to a hierarchical setup with high level coordination via a shared learned latent variable. The evaluations are not very strong due to toy task setup, however the approach is clear and impactful.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
