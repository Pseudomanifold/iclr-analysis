{"title": "An interesting model without enough experimental justifications", "review": "This paper proposed a new training framework to disentangle global structures from local structures \nbased on Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). They first generate a transformed image by shuffl\u000fing the \npatches of the original image to destroy the global structures. The training task forces the model to\nreconstruct the original image and shuffled images from different latent variables, thus separating \nglobal long-range structural correlations and local patch-wise correlations .\n\nInstead of adjusting the objective function or model structure, the paper proposed a new and simple\ntraining framework to disentangle the global and local structures, which is novel. \n\nThe experiment results are good on SVHN. Some visual inspection experiments on CIFAR10 are performed. \nThe plot (Figure2 (d)) is very blurry and people cannot really tell local structure from it. The rest experiments \nare all based on SVHN, which is too simple. \n\nMore experiments based on other types of data sets with clear global structures such as faces or stop signs will \nbe more convincing.\n\nIn the digit dataset, the local and global structures are relatively easy to separate. However, in Table 1, the \nperformance of VAE+Auxiliary is not better than two of the other methods.\n\nThe idea in this paper is novel but experiments do not seem to be enough. More experiments on datasets \nwith clear global and local structure separations with careful analyses are required to make the paper stronger.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
