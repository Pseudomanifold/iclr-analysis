{"title": "Interesting, but unsure about the impact", "review": "This paper proposes an exploration of the effect of normalization and initialization in residual networks. In particular, the Authors propose a novel way to initialize residual networks, which is motivated by the need to avoid exploding/vanishing gradients. The paper proposes some theoretical analysis of the benefits of the proposed initialization. \n\nI find the paper well written and the idea well executed overall. The proposed analysis is clear and motivates well the proposed initialization. Overall, I think this adds something to the literature on residual networks, helping the reader to get a better understanding of the effect of normalization and initialization. I have to admit I am not an expert on residual networks, so it is possible that I have overlooked at previous contributions from the literature that illustrate some of these concepts already. Having said that, the proposal seems novel enough to me. \n\nOverall, I think that the experiments have a satisfactory degree of depth. The only question mark is on the performance of the proposed method, which is comparable to batch normalization. If I understand correctly, this is something remarkable given that it is achieved without the common practice of introducing normalizations. However, I have not found a convincing argument against the use of batch normalization in favor of ZeroInit. I believe this is something to elaborate on in the revised version of this paper, as it could increase the impact of this work and attract a wider readership.
