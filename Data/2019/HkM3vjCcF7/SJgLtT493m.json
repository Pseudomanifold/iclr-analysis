{"title": "Ok but incremental", "review": "Summary: \n\nThis paper proposes a modification to the original hourglass network for single pose estimation using (1) a preprocessing network to generate multiscale feature maps (2) a upgrade of hourglass network backbone (3) using a adaptive loss weighting strategy. It yields some improvements over the original baseline. \n\nCons: \nThe method is somewhat incremental with respect to original work and only compares algorithm 2 years ago without comparing to current SOTA methods. \n\nBy checking the online benchmarks of MPII, the Tang et al., ECCV'18 results has already reach 92.8 while the proposed one is 91.2, which is significant lower than other SOTA strategies. \n\n\n\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
