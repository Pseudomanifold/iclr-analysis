{"title": "Useful result on universality. Probably not extremely relevant to ICLR", "review": "The paper investigates the approximation properties of a family of neural networks designed to address multi-instance learning (MIL) problems. The authors show that results well-known for standard one layer architectures extend to the MIL models considered. The authors focus on tree-structured domains showing that their analysis applies to these relevant settings. \n\nThe paper is well written and easy to follow. In particular the theoretical analysis is clear and pleasant to read. \n\nThe main concern is related to the relevance of the result to ICLR. As the authors themselves state, the result is not surprising given the standard universality result of one-layer neural networks (and indeed Thm. 2 heavily relies on this fact to prove the universality of MIL architectures). In this sense the current work might be more suited to a journal venue. \n\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
