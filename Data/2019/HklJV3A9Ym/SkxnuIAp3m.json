{"title": "Interesting but...", "review": "This paper generalizes the universal approximation theorem (usually stated for real functions on some Euclidean space) to real functions on the space of measures (at least a compact set of proba. measures).\n\nThis result might be interesting but not really surprising and the paper does not put any new theoretical ideas or proof techniques. The proof is actually almost identical than in the original paper of Hornik, Stinchcombe and White (89) [and not the 91 paper of Hornik as indicated in the paper], the only difference being a trick on the density of f\\circ h instead of just considering cos() function.\n\nAll in all, the contributions is interesting but really incremental", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
