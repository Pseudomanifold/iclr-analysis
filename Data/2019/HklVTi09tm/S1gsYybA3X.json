{"title": "A nice application of machine learning without much insight to machine learning practitioners.", "review": "In this paper the authors apply methods developed in computer vision towards the identification of topological defects in nematic liquid crystals. Typically, defects are identified using a costly algorithm that is based on numerically computing the winding number at different locations in the image to identify defects. The authors demonstrate that a deep learning approach offers improvement to both the identification accuracy and rate at which defects can be identified. Finally, the authors do some work investigating the limitations of the model and show that breakdown occurs near the edge of the field of view of the microscope. They show that this also happens with a conventional approach.\n\nOverall, this seemed like a nice application of machine learning to a subject that has received significant attention from soft matter community. The results appear to be carefully presented and the analysis seems solid. However, it does not seem to me that ICLR is a particularly appropriate venue for this work and it is unclear exactly what this paper adds to a discussion on machine learning. While there is nothing wrong with taking an existing architecture (YOLO) and showing that it can successfully be applied to another domain, it does limit the machine learning novelty. It also does not seem as though the authors pushed particularly hard in this direction. I would have been interested, for example, in seeing some analysis of the features learned by the architecture trained to classify defects appropriately.\n\nI would encourage the authors to either submit this work to a journal closer to soft matter or to do some work to determine what insights and lessons might help machine learning researchers working on other applied projects. The closest I got from the paper was the discussion of bounding box sizes and subclassification in section 3. It would have been nice to see some work discussing the dependence on this choice and what physical insights one might be able to glean from it. \n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
