{"title": "A definite incautious paper, no novelty and wrong formatting", "review": "This paper applied an object detection network, like SSD, for optical character detection and recognition. This paper doesn't give any new contributions and has no potential values.\n\nweakness:\n1. the paper is lack of novelty and the motivation is weak. I even can't find any contribution to OCR or object detection.\n\n2. the paper is written badly so that I can't follow easily. In addition, the figures and tables are not always explained in the main body, which makes the experimental results confusing.\n\n3. There are no titles in the figures and tables in this paper\n\n4. the authors don't confirm the superiority of the proposed method to others.\n\nminor comments\n1. what's the meaning of Target mAP in the table?\n2. It seems that Some figures are cropped from TensorBoard, with some extra shadows.", "rating": "2: Strong rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
