{"title": "Interesting but is hardly to ready due to the confusing introduction", "review": "The authors proposed a Modulated Variational auto-Encoders (MoVE) to perform musical timbre transfer. The authors define timbre transfer as applying parts of the auditory properties of a musical instrument onto another. It replaces the usual adversarial translation criterion by a Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) objective. By further conditioning our system on several different instruments, the proposed method can generalize to many-to-many transfer within a single variational architecture able to perform multi-domain transfers.\nSome detailed comments are listed as follow,\n1 The implementation steps of the proposed method (MoVE) are not clear. Some details are missing, which is hardly reproduced by the other researchers.\n2 The experimental settings are not reasonable. The current experimental settings are not matched with the practice environment. \n3 The proposed method can transfer the positive knowledge. However, some negative knowledge information can be also transferred. So how to avoid the negative transferring? \n4 For the model, the optimization details or inferring details are missing, which are important for the proposed model.\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
