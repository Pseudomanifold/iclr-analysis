{"title": "Contextual decomposition for general DNNs", "review": "**Summary**\n\nIn this paper, the authors extend an existing feature interpretation method for LSTMs to more generic DNNs. They introduce a hierarchical clustering of the input features and the contributions of each cluster to the final prediction. \n\n**Strength**\n\n1. Splitting information into binary groups at each layer is a neat approach to segregate interpretations.\n2. Experiments are elaborate and cover the breadth of the proposed method well.\n3. The paper is well presented and fairly easy to follow. \n\n\n**Weakness**\n\n1. Limited contributions in terms of novelty. This approach for RNNs is presented fairly well in the previous paper [Beyond Word Importance: Contextual Decomposition to Extract Interactions from LSTMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.05453).\n2. It seems that there is not enough justification for the modifications in beta and gamma made for convolution and pooling layers.\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
