{"title": "An application of tree and DAG LSTMs with important details missing from the draft", "review": "The paper proposes to plan by taking an initial plan and improving it. The authors claim that 1) this will achieve results faster than planning from scratch and 2) will lead to better results than using quick, local heuristics. However, when starting with an initial solution there is always the danger of the final solution being overly biased by the initial solution. The authors do not address this adequately. They show how to apply tree and DAG-based LSTMs to job scheduling and shortening expressions. Since they are simply using previously proposed LSTM variants, I do not see much contribution here. The experiments show some gains on randomly generated datasets. More importantly, details are missing such as the definitions of SP and RS from section 4.4.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
