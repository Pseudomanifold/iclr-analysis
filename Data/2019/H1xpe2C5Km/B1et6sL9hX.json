{"title": "A neat idea", "review": "This paper proposes a traceback layer for capsule networks to do semantic segmentation. Comparing to previous works that use capsule networks for semantic segmentation, this paper makes explicit use of part-whole relationship in the capsule layers. Experiments are done on modified MNIST and Hippocampus dataset. Results demonstrate encouraging improvements over U-Net. The writing could be tremendously improved if some background of the capsule networks is included. \n\nI have a question about the traceback layer. It seems to me that the traceback layer re-uses the learned weights c_{ij} between the primary capsules and the class capsules as guidance when \u201cdistributing\u201d class probabilities to a spatial class probabilistic heatmap. One piece of information I feel missing is the affine transformation that happens between the primary capsule and the class capsule. The traceback layer doesn\u2019t seem to invert such a transformation. Should it do so? \n\nSince there have been works that use capsule networks for semantic segmentation, does it make sense to compare to them (e.g. LaLonde & Bagci, 2018) ?", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
