{"title": "Not good enough", "review": "This paper tries to build a neural net to learn Nash equilibrium of games, even though it has been proved that no uncoupled algorithm can do that, except on specific games, as the ones considered in the example (0-sum, potentiel, solvable by iterated elimination of dominated strategies, etc.).\n\nThe algorithm proposed is a classical neural net without any insight (I believe its behavio must more or less be similar to regret matching).\n\nIn table 10, I do not think that the underline case is the NE. \n\nIn table 12, the algorithm si conveniently initiated at the NE.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
