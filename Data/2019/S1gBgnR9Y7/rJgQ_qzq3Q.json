{"title": "The paper introduces Gapnet, that uses a CNN architecture to learn pharmacological assays from high-resolution microscopy images. The paper deals with a valid problem of handling images in a segmentation-agnostic way.", "review": "The paper is well written, deals with a valid and crucial end-to-end imaging problem. \n\nComments\n1) Section 2: It is not clear how 10574 compounds increase to 11585 (2nd paragraph page 3). Also how does one arrive at 11171 compounds (para 3). \n2) How do you arrive at 209 assays from 10818?\nDo consider enumerating this Section: data dimensions you started with and then how the dimensions were reduced per step. I gather you have mentioned this but it is confusing to grasp, at this point. \n\n3) In page 2, you mention the images have 5 channels but towards the end of the section on page 3, it says 1) views have \u20186\u2019 such images per sample image and 2) 4 channels for stains. How many stains are there per channel and how are 5 channels related to the \u20186\u2019 and 4 channels? \n\n4) In Section 4 and Appendix 6, it does not seem that Gapnet outperforms, rather it is at par to, other architectures. Is the only gain with Gapnet the runtime across epochs?", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
