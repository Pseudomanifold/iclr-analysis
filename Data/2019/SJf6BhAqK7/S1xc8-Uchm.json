{"title": "Novelty is unclear", "review": "The paper proposes a meta-learning method that utilizes unlabeled examples along with labeled examples. The technique proposed is very similar to the one by (Ren et al. 2018), only differing in the choice of a different clustering algorithm (Kulis and Jordan, 2012) instead of soft k-means as used by Ren et al. \n\nI feel the contrast to Ren et al, is not provided to the degree it should be. The Appendix paragraph A4 is not sufficient in terms of explaining why this method is conceptually different or significantly better than the related approach. It is hard for me to certify the merits of their work, including explaining the experimental results.\n\nI also do not understand the significance of \"multi-model clustering\" in this context. Also, by their definition of \"variadic\", how is this more variadic than Ren et al. or Snell et al.?\n\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}
