{"title": "Good paper", "review": "The paper observes the gradient of multiple objective such as IWAE, RWS, JVI are in the form of some \u201creward\u201d multiplied with score function which can be calculated with one more reparameterization step to reduce the variance. The whole paper is written in a clean way and the method is effective.\n\nI have following comments/questions:\n\n1. The conclusion in Eq(5) is correct but the derivation in Sec. 8.1. may be arguable. Writing \\phi and \\tilde{\\phi} at the first place sets the partial derivative of \\tilde{\\phi}  to \\phi as 0. But the choice of \\tilde{\\phi} in the end is chosen as \\phi. If plugging  \\phi to \\tilde{\\phi}, the derivation will change. The better way may be calculating both the reparameterization and reinforce gradient without redefining a \\tilde{\\phi}.\n\n2. How does the variance of gradient calculated where the gradient is a vector? And how does the SNR defined in the experiments?\n\n3. How does the variance reduction from DReG changes with different value of K?\n\n4. Is there any more detailed analysis or intuition why the right hand side of Eq(5) has lower variance than the left hand side?", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
