{"title": "Doubly Reparameterized Gradient Estimators for Monte Carlo Objectives", "review": "This paper applies a reparameterization trick to estimate the gradients objectives encountered in variational autoencoder based frameworks with continuous latent variables.  Especially the authors use this double reparameterization trick on Importance Weighted Auto-Encoder (IWAE) and Reweighted Wake-Sleep (RWS)  methods. Compared to IWAE, the developed method's SNR does not go to zero with increasing the number of particles.\n\nOverall, I think the idea is nice and the results are encouraging. I checked all the derivations, and they seem to be correct. Thus I recommend this paper to be accepted in its current form.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
