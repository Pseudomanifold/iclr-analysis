{"title": "main contributions: bringing in the concept from teacher-student, same task to different task in transfer learning by modifying the weights of outer layers", "review": "Summary\nThe paper describes using the technique of modifying the weights for the outer layers, used in teacher-student network for same task, to transfer learning for different tasks by modifying the loss function and pre-training using target network labels to emphasize the neurons that are considered important for prediction. The technique seems to be no more/slightly better than the Lsquare SP, but exceeds when used with attention.\n\nImprovements\n- the amount of training time needed to pre-train using the L-square FE and target labels should be mentioned as it seems that for large network, and large data, this can be a factor\n- The choice of Resnet, at least one of the more recent networks for object detection (Inception, YOLO etc.)  would be a good add", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
