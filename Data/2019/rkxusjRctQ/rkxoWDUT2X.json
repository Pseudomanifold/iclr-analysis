{"title": "Very informative and great paper", "review": "This paper proposes generative approaches to localization without explicit high definition geometric maps. A generative baseline (GQN) and an extension to that with attention is introduced in the context of localization. \n\nThe paper is clearly written, and the relevant previous work is discussed to satisfying degree. \n\nFigures 2 and 3 help understanding the GQN and the proposed attention version a lot. \n\nI am intrigued with the result presented in table 1. especially with the fact that attention is helping the generative method quite a bit, but not so much for the discriminative method. This is not discussed in detail in the paper, I suggest the authors expand their discussion a bit in this direction. \n\nThe second suggestion is in terms of the data. I understand the motivations behind using the minecraft world. however, real data is still quite different than this data, think about various differences in the real world at time of training and test even at the same location texture of sky and lighting will change. On top of this, there is quite a bit of variance in levels of detail compared to the monotonic minecraft world. I suggest using a real dataset for another set of experiments. This can be added as an appendix. \n\nIn general, very good motivation, and intriguing work for the community -- localization with high definition geometric works is tough to scale, and implicit world representations are an important piece in relaxing this dependency. I believe this paper will motive more future work. ", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
