{"title": "Some mixed results and needs further analysis", "review": "This paper presents question generation models by designing variations of copying mechanism and reward functions. Experimental results show that different copying mechanism can improve upon basic seq2seq models, some of the reward functions also produce better results. I think the results are interesting, especially the ones compared with human evaluation (fig. 1), but it's might be better to explain on which aspect each of the feature contributes to the improvement. For instance, the authors can give some insights based on empirical results on what kind of questions will benefit from each type of copying. \n\n\nThe authors should better organize table 1 and 2, and inform the readers on what is the consistent conclusion (if any). For table 2, there is no result for adding \"adversarial discriminator\" only. Also the item \"+226\" on the second row, is that an error?\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
