{"title": "Novelty limited and experiments not convincing enough", "review": "In the paper, author investigate the use of copy mechanisms for the question generation task. It evaluates on the SQuAD dataset. The model is a popular seq2seq/encoder-decoder model with copy mechanisms using pointer networks. \n\nPros:\nIt is well motivated. For the question generation task, a word to be predicted can be from either a global vocabulary list or copied from the given documents (location vocabulary).  There are some overlap between these two vocabulary lists.  This paper mainly investigates this issue.\n\nIt is well written and easy to follow.\n\nInteresting analysis of human/automatic metrics.\n\nCons:\nThe tricks here are a bit of ad hoc. It is better to have a systemic study.\n\nBaseline results are too low. E.g., officially QANet results (from the paper) on SQuAD v1 is around 82.7 (my implementation obtains 83.1). However in the paper, its best result is 72.6 in terms of F1 score. \n\nThe authors only evaluated on one dataset. It is hard to convincing.\n\nIt is lack of comparison results of question generation in literature. \n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
