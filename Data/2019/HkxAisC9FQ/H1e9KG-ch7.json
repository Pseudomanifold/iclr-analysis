{"title": "Interesting idea -- could be significantly strengthened", "review": "Summary: this paper uses a trick to simplify the adversarial loss by one in which the adversarial perturbation appears in closed form.\n\npros:\n\n- interesting idea\n- experiments are interesting\n\ncons:\n\n- formal results are either trivial or could be improved in their statements \n- experimental guarantees only, up to what is hidden in the Big-Oh notations of Theorem 2.2, 2.3.\n\ndetails:\n\n* In Theorem 2.2, you need to remove the $O(epsilon^2)$, unless you point to the Taylor theorem that guarantees that for the identity you claim before (5). The closest one I see is that the O(||a||^2) is in fact $||a|| u(||a||)$ with $\\lim u(x) = 0$ as $x \\rightarrow 0$, which does not guarantee the $O$ notation for any $a$.\n\n* In Theorem 2.2, how do you pass from the solution of (5) (which is indeed a vector) to the solution of the following equation, which, without constraint, gives a dim > 1 subspace in the general case ?\n\n* In all cases, you do not get Theorem 2.3 in its form as the $O$ notation just guarantees you an upperbound. You need to rephrase.\n\n* Figure ?? (twice) before Section 3\n\n* Define the \u201cgroup norm\u201d notation appearing with the max in (8) (isn\u2019t one redundant ?)\n\n* Section 3.4 is interesting. Have you looked at generalising your observation in the last identity to more losses  = f-divergences (hence, proper losses modulo assumptions) ? \n\n* Section 4: many Figure ??", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
