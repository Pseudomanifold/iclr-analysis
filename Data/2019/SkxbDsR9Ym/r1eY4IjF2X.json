{"title": "The paper \"RELWALK \u2013 A LATENT VARIABLE MODEL APPROACH TO KNOWLEDGE GRAPH EMBEDDING\" is about a generative knowledge graph embedding process and a theoretic motivation for a corresponding scoring function.", "review": "+ Theoretic explanation for the scoring function.\n+ (Promise for) Online provided source code.\n+ The paper is well-written.\n\n- The authors missed [1] which also introduces a generative model for knowledge graph embeddings. \n- The use of the datasets FB15k-237 and WN18RR instead of FB15k and WN18 (without inverse relations) would enable a better empirical evaluation. By using the flawed FB15k and WN18 datasets, the evaluation is biased towards the usage of inverse relations which should not exist in a link prediction evaluation dataset.\n- The authors are not mentioning and comparing to walk based approaches like node2vec [2], Deepwalk [3], and rdf2vec [4]. \n\n\nDue to the missing comparisons to the mentioned references above and the possible bias in the evaluation, I am leaning towards rejecting the paper.\n\n\nMinor comments:\n\n.
