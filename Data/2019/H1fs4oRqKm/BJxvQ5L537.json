{"title": "Interesting \"fix\" to Godard et al 2017", "review": "Summary: This work is closely based on Godard et al 2017. The latter work does not handle occlusions well, as they give rise to artefacts and duplicates due to the use of backwards bilinear sampling (which is key to the method however, since it is locally sub-differentiable). Such artefacts, in turn, result in blurred disparity maps once trained on. The present work fixes this, and correspondingly obtains good experimental results, by defining an occlusion mask (section 3.2), and a way to get rid of the blurriness (section 3.3).\nThe experimental validation of the fix is carried out similarly to Godard et al 2017, with identical losses, on the same KITTI dataset, using the same splits, but also on the virtual KITTI dataset.\n\nThe paper is structured alright. The presentation is rather sloppy overall, with agrammatical sentences (noun-gerund-infinitive confusions, mainly) which repeatedly get in the way of understanding, sloppy character spacing and punctuation, references from the main text to the supplementary material. Individual paragraphs are exempt of errors and read smoothly.\nThe experimental evaluation seems adequate. \nThe related work section is uncomfortably similar to Godard et al 2017, from which it borrows the presentation structure, and mostly the order of introduction of individual references.\n\nIt almost seems like this is an obligatory fix to Godard et al 2017, and might in the future be considered a standard correction to it. Overall, the scientific contribution appears to be slim.\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
