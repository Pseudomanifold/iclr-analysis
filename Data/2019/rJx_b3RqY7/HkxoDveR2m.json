{"title": "A Review on Adversarial Inference by Matching Priors and Conditionals", "review": "The goal this is work is to develop a generative model that enjoys the strengths of both GAN and VAE without their inherent weaknesses. The paper proposes a learning framework, in which a generating process p is modeled by a neural network called generator, and an inference process q by another neural network encoder. The ultimate goal is to match the joint distributions, p(x, z) and q(x, z), and this is done by attempting to match the priors  p(z) and q(z) and matching the conditionals p(x|z) and q(x|z). As both q(z) and q(x|z) are impossible to sample from, the authors mathematically expand this objective criterion and rewrite to be dependent only on p(x|z), q(x) and q(z|x), that can be easily sampled from. In the main part of the work, the authors use the f-divergence theory (Nowozin et al., 2016) to present the optimization problem as minmax optimization problem, that is learned using an adversarial game, using training and inference algorithms that are proposed by the authors. In experiments, the authors consider both reconstruction and generation tasks using the MNIST, CIFAR10 and CelebA datasets. Results show that the proposed method yields better MSE reconstruction error as better as a higher inception scores for the generated examples, compared to a standard GAN and a few other methods. \n\nThis work establishes an important bridge between the VAE and GAN framework, and has a a good combination of theoretical and experimental aspects. Experiments results are encouraging, even though only relatively simple and small datasets were used. Overall, I would recommend accepting the paper for presentation in the conference.
