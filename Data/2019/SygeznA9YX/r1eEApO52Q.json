{"title": " I think this paper is an OK paper, although it can be further improved if more experimental results are provided.", "review": "In this paper, the authors proposed a pipeline to solve Data Interpretation over Plots (DIP) problem, involving learning from datasets containing triplets of the form {plot, question, answer}. This paper introduces a new dataset for the DIP problem. The authors develop a pipeline that break down the task into two step, to learn from this dataset. \n\nIn general, this paper is well-written. I am able to understand the DIP problem, the dataset and the proposed pipeline. \n\nThe process of constructing the DIP dataset looks reasonable. The strategy adopted in the proposed pipeline, which break down the task into two step, looks interesting. However, I do not consider this strategy completely novel, since each component of the proposed pipeline is based on existing method.\n\nMy major concerns about this paper might be related to the experiments. In the paper, the authors claim that the dataset is very challenging and beyond existing end-to-end models. I believe this claim might be true; however, I think the authors should still support this claim with experiments, even if end-to-end models give very poor results. I would also suggest the authors test the proposed method on easier dataset, such that it can be fairly compared with existing methods. \n\nIn summary, I think this paper is an OK paper, although it can be further improved if more experimental results are provided.\n\nI found a typo in the paper.
