{"title": "limited novelty ", "review": "This paper present a spatio-temporal (i.e., 3D version) of Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks (CycleGAN) for unsupervised video-to-video translation. The evaluations on multiple datasets show the proposed model is better able to work for video translation in terms of image continuity and frame-wise translation quality. \n\nThe major contribution of this paper is extending the existing CycleGAN model from image-to-image translation and video-to-video translation using 3D convolutional networks, while it additionally proposes a total penalty term to the loss function. So I mainly concern that such contribution might be not enough for the ICLR quality. \n", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
