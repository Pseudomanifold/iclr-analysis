{"title": "Interesting but not good enough!", "review": "This paper proposes to train a Universal Phonetic Model for building speech recognition for new languages without any training data. It suggests to use X-SAMPA to map phones from all the languages into a single phonetic space. The prediction models are designed to first predict the phonetic features and then the phones depending on the target language.\nOverall , the paper is quite clear written. \n- Strengthens:\n+ It observed overall improvements for all the target languages.\n\n- Weaknesses:\n+ The idea and the proposed model are not novel. \n+ All the baseline systems have relative high phone error rates.\n+ The authors claimed to have a universal phonetic model but actually the model was trained only with English data. Therefore, experimental setup could be improved. In my opinion, it makes more sense to define a bunch of resource-rich languages as source and then train a real universal phonetic model. \n+ Overall, this paper lacks an analysis what are exactly improved and why the improvements for some target languages are larger than for the others.\n ", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
