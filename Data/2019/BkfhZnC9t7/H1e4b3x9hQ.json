{"title": "Review", "review": "This paper presents an approach to address the task on zero-shot learning for speech recognition, which consist of learning an acoustic model without any resources for a given language. The universal phonetic model is proposed, which learns phone attributes (instead of phone label), which allows to do prediction on any phone set, i.e. on any language. The model is evaluated on 20 languages and is shown to improve over a baseline trained only on English.\n\nThe proposed UPM approach is novel and significant: being able to learn a more abstract representation for phones which is language-independent is a very promising lead to handle the problem of ASR on languages with low or no resources available. \n\nHowever, the results are the weak point of the paper. While the results demonstrate the viability of the approach, the gain between the baseline performance and the UPM model is quite small, and it's still far from being usable in practice. \n\nTo improve the paper, the authors should discuss the future work, i.e. what are the next steps to improve the model.\n\nOverall, the paper is significant and can pave the way for a new category of approaches to tackle zero-shot learning for speech recognition. Even if the results are not great, as a first step they are completely acceptable, so I recommend to accept the paper.\n\nRevision:\nThe approach of using robust features is interesting and promising, as well as the idea of training on multiple languages. Overall, the authors response addressed most of the issues, therefore I am not changing my rating.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
