{"title": "Diversity and Depth in Per-Example Routing Models - Review", "review": "Overall, this is a valuable read. Authors tackle the head on problem of what is a good architecture where we can having routing with diverse models. The papers is written well, with comparisons to mixture of experts, other models that tackled this problem with either homogeneous architectures or static architectures. Below is my assessment on various axis:\n\nQuality - Enough experiments to justify some conclusions, equations helped ground the method with math.\n\nclarity - Very well written, good figures and analysis.\n\noriginality - While the authors achieve SOA results on OmniGlot and do explore a few options, I feel the work still lacks originality in the formulation or does not have original contributions to either the architectures used or the optimization procedures employed.\n\nsignificance - very significant to look at this problem both in terms of compute, accuracy perspective as well as scaling these networks for multiple tasks.\n\npros - thorough analysis, even the negative experiments are well written and throw more light into the problem space.\n\ncons - OmniGlot comparisons seem not fair as the model capacity is not added as part of the table which raises concerns on achieving state of the art with more high complexity models than routing mechanism. Will be great to move from CIFAR-10 and test things on CIFAR-100 to really see the value of proposed work. I would recommend a higher rating if authors address these two concerns.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
