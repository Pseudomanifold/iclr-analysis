{"title": "Interesting paper on co-optimizing robot structure and control", "review": "This paper discusses the optimization of robot structures, combined with their controllers. The authors propose a scheme\nbased on a graph representation of the robot structure, and a graph-neural-network as controllers. The experiments show\nthat the proposed scheme is able to produce walking and swimming robots in simulation. The results in this paper are impressive, and the paper seems free of technical errors. \n\nThe main criticism I have is that I found the paper harder to read. In particular, the exact difference between the proposed method and the ES baseline is not as clear as it could be. This makes the contribution of this paper in terms of the method\nhard to judge. Please include further description of the ES cost function and algorithm in the main body of the paper.\n\nThe second point is that the proposed approach seems to modify a few things from the ES baseline. The efficacy of the separate modifications should be tested. Therefore I would like to see experiments with the ES cost function, but with\ninclusion of the pruning step, and experiments with the AF-function but without the pruning step.", "rating": "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
