{"title": "Interesting paper that shows a failure case of FID", "review": "The paper proposes a new evaluation metric for generative adversarial networks and shows that it is better aligned with human judgment than FID. The metric is based on a domain-specific encoder to extract features of the image rather than ImageNet inception network and a class-aware Frechet distance which makes a Gaussian mixture assumption for the extracted features rather than a simple Gaussian assumption for FID. The paper shows an advantage for the new metric vs the others by constructing examples where FID fails while the proposed metric doesn't. Although this is an interesting finding, it is not a breakthrough in the sense that a domain-specific representation is expected to be better behaved than the features of the inception classifier and using a Gaussian mixture would be an obvious step after FID. Moreover, other metrics don't even rely on any assumption on the features distributions [1,2], so I would expect them to behave at least as well as the proposed metric.  \n\n\n[1] :M. Arjovsky, S.
