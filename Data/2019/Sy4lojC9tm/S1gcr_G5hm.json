{"title": "An algorithm to reduce datatset size for  NNs", "review": "The paper presents an algorithm for compressing the size of entire training data into a few synthetic training samples. The method is based on neural networks and is applied on image datsets. The authors comment two possible applications of their method domain adaptation and effective data poisoning attack.\n\nThe proposed technique seems to be limited to neural networks since it seems that is linked to the initialization of the networks. In this aspect, it could be interesting to have a more general method.\n\nThere are related works that are not commented, for instance :\n\nOlvera-L\u00f3pez, J. Arturo, et al. \"A review of instance selection methods.\" Artificial Intelligence Review 34.2 (2010): 133-143.\n\n\nExperimental section is weak. Few datasets are considered, other problems should be added. Additionally, related methods should be included to  compare the performance of the proposal. Some comments about the computational cost should be inserted. In this aspect, the experimental section should be improved following these recommendations.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
