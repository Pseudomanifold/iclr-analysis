{"title": "Several misleading claims", "review": "This paper describes a system for classifying  images  displayed  on  the  websites  by  using an incremental  learning  classifier with Deep Convolutional Neural Network to be used in context aware advertisement.\n\nThis is more of an application paper which is not the focus of a venue like ICLR. Further the paper makes several misleading claims. They claim that their system is inspired by the human brain while providing scant evidence to prove that claim (Unless we take it in a very broad sense to mean that neural networks resemble the human brain). Also they propose a convolutional autoencoder as a kind of an encryption method to store images to alleviate privacy and legal concerns. This is not a good idea because encoding an image using a convnet is not a substitute for encryption. In fact any image hence encoded can be decoded easily to reveal the original contents of the image. Overall this paper is not appropriate for ICLR in its current form.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
