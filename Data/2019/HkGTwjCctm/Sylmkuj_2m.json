{"title": "Nice model with somewhat lacking experimental validation.", "review": "This paper proposes a pyramid based neural net which both decomposes a signal into several scales (learning the basis functions to do that) and processes the resulting bands in a scale invariant manner. The method is applied to 1D signals with underlying processes occurring at different time scales where the task is change point detection.\n\nPros:\n* Nice model and model formulation - learning the basis functions both for the low and high frequency is a nice idea. I also liked the way weights are shared across scales. In particular that the information flow between consecutive scales is shared, as well as through time.\n\n* Writing is very clear and method is well motivated\n\nCons:\n* I found the experimental validation a bit limited - the presented results are nice and for the problem quite comprehensive but I would have wanted something a bit more complicated than change point detection. Specifically, since the natural world is full of scale free phenomena it would have been much more interesting with other tasks (generative models? natural images? many options). I feel this would have made the case for the paper much stronger.\n* There's also very little analysis of what is learned from the data - how do the kernels look like and how do they correspond to known wavelets? to the data? would be nice to understand what's going on here.\n\n\nBottom line:\nI like the proposed model and for what it is it's quite good but it would have been a much more convincing paper with more experiments demonstrating the power of the method and analyzing it.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
