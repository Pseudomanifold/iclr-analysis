{"title": "Interesting paper", "review": "This paper proposes a new architecture for adversarial training that is able to improve both accuracy and robustness performances using an attention-based model for feature prioritization and L2 regularization as implicit denoising. The paper is very clear and well written and the contribution is relevant to ICLR. \n\nPros:\n\n- The background, model and experiments are clearly explained. The paper provides fair comparisons with a strong baseline on standard datasets.\n- Using attention mechanisms to improve the model robustness in an adversarial training setting is a strong and novel contribution \n- Both quantitative and qualitative results are interesting. \n\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}
