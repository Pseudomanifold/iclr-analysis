{"title": "Review for the paper: \"On Inductive Biases in Deep Reinforcement Learning\"", "review": "This paper focuses on deep reinforcement learning methods and discusses the presence of inductive biases in the existingRL algorithm. Specifically, they discuss biases that take the form of domain knowledge or hyper-parameter tuning. The authors state that such biases rise the tradeoff between generality and performance wherein strong biases can lead to efficient performance but deteriorate generalization across domains. Further, it motivates that most inductive biases has a cost associated to it and hence it is important to study and analyze the effect of such biases. \n\nTo support their insights, the authors investigate the performance of well known actor-critic model in the Atari environment after replacing domain specific heuristics with the adaptive components. The author considers two ways of injecting biases: i) sculpting agents objective and ii) sculpting agent's environment. They show empirical evidence that replacing carefully designed heuristics to induce biases with more adaptive counterparts preserves performance and generalizes without additional fine tuning.\n\nThe paper focuses on an important concept and problem of inductive biases in deep reinforcement learning techniques. \nAnalysis of such biases and methods to use them judiciously is an interesting future direction. The paper covers a lot of related work in terms of various algorithms and corresponding biases.\nHowever, this paper only discusses such concepts at high level and provides short empirical evidences in a single environment to support their arguments. Further, both the heuristics used in practice and the adaptive counterparts that the paper uses to replace those heuristics are all available in existing approaches and there is no novel contribution in that direction too.\nFinally, the adaptive methods based on parallel environment and RNNs have several limitation, as per author's own admission.\n\nOverall, the paper does not have any novel technical contributions or theoretical analysis on the effect of such inductive biases which makes it very weak. Further, there is nothing surprising about the author's claims and many of the outcomes from the analysis are expected. The authors are recommended to consider this task more rigorously and provide stronger and concrete analysis on the effects of inductive biases on variety of algorithms and variety of environments.\n\n\n\n", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
