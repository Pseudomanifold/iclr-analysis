{"title": "Lacks clarity", "review": "In the manuscript entitled \"Likelihood-based Permutation Invariant Loss Function for Probability Distributions\" the authors propose a loss function for training against instances in which ordering within the data vector is unimportant.  I do not find the proposed loss function to be well motivated, find a number of confusing points (errors?) in the manuscript, and do not easily follow what was done in the examples.\n\nFirst, it should be noted that this is a very restricted consideration of what it means to compare two sets since only sets of equal size are under consideration; this is fundamentally different to the ambitions of e.g. the Hausdorff measure as used in analysis.  The logsumexp formulation of the proposed measure is unsatisfactory to me as it directly averages over each of the independent probabilities that a given element is a member of the target set, rather than integrating over the combinatorial set of probabilities for each set of complete possible matches.  Moreover, the loss function H() is not necessarily representative of a generative distribution.\n\nThe definition of the Hausdorff distance given is directional and is therefore not a metric, contrary to what is stated on page 2.\n\nI find the description of the problem domain confusing on page 3: the space [0,1]^NxF is described as binary, but then values of log y_i and log (1-y_i) are computed with y in [0,1] so we must imagine these are in fact elements in the open set of reals: (0,1).\n\nClarity of the examples could be greatly improved, in particular by explaining precisely what is the objective of each task and what are the 'ingredients' we begin with.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
