{"title": "novelty would be low", "review": "The paper evaluates two moving average strategies for GAN optimization. Since exact theoretical analysis is difficult for this case, some informal consideration are provided for explanation of performance gain. Experiments confirmed high performance of averaging.\n\nThe basic idea seems to be reasonable. Moving average-based strategy would stabilize optimization process. \n\nThe obvious weakness of the paper is technical novelty. Although the experimental improvement is confirmed, I would have to say just comparing two known averaging methods would not have strong novelty.\n\nSection 3.1 would be most important part of the paper, but it only mentions quite general tendency of averaging (seems not specific to GAN).", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}
