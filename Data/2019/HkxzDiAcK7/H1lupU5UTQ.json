{"title": "The motivation of the problem is not clear", "review": "1) Motivation of the problem is not very clear: It seems like the aim is classify impulse noise types and if they originate from the top, bottom or same floor. What is not clear, however, is the usefulness of collecting the test and train data from the same building. Shouldn't the test and train data be from mutually exclusive buildings?\n2) It is also not clear whether the datasets were collected from one or many buildings\n3) The authors should also provide an intuitive explanation why the sounds from the three floors would sound different. And is this specific to a particular building or can be generalized across buildings? Would the size and contents of the rooms (e.g, carpets, furnitures) have an impact on the accuracy?", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}
