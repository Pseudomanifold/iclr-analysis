{"title": "Novel application area but lacking in novelty in modeling technique.", "review": "This work describes the use of convolutional neural networks in a novel application area of building noise type classification and noise position classification. The paper describes the motivation, dataset and the evaluation in great detail . However the modeling techniques being used are lacking in originality.\nThe paper is unique and interesting but this conference might not be the most appropriate one for this publication.
