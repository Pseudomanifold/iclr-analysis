{"title": "Ill-defined", "review": "The authors propose to study what they call weak contraction map. The idea may have its merits, but in the present form, it is not acceptable.\n\nNotably, the key definition of the paper, that is that of the weak contraction mapping (starting with \"Then a mapping T : X \u2192 X is called weak\") is incomplete, because it uses a \\mathcal{R}, which is never defined. This makes it hard to evaluate any of the results. \n\nFurther, there is no clear separation between text and theorems. Worse, the theorems are not self-contained. E.g. what could perhaps be Theorem 2 (Starting with \"x* is a fixed-point of T in X0.\") does not define x*.\n\nWhile I cannot be certain because of the reasons stated above, the authors seem to have had in mind something like the Kakutani theorem:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakutani_fixed-point_theorem\nwhich they don't cite. Their assumptions on the map are weaker than that of Kakutani (upper hemicontinuity), which makes me a bit doubtful as to whether the statements could be proven, even if made precise.
