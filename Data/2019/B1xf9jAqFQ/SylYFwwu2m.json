{"title": "review", "review": "The paper proposes a fast-reading method using skip and jump actions. The paper shows that the proposed method is as accurate as LSTM but uses much less computation.\n\n* pros: \n- very fast reading model (?). \n\n* cons: \n- although the paper is well written, the jump is not described in details. \n- using 'structural-jump' is a little misleading. The model will jump to \".,!\" or end of sentence. What is called \"structural\"? Note that those punctuation marks are not 100% correlated to sentence structure. For example, \"He hate fruits such as apples, pears, and oranges.\" The mode should jump to the end of sentence rather than the first \",\" when reading \"such\". \n- maybe the authors should say a little bit about the used computation-cost-reduction method. (I.e. in an appendix). ", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
