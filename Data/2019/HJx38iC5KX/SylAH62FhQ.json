{"title": "The proposed problem seems similar to traditional conditional distribution matching problem. ", "review": "The paper proposed a problem that most prior methods overlooked the underlying dependency of classes on domains, namely p (y|d) \\= p(y).   Figure 1 is used to illustrate this issue. \n\nIf the conditional probability of source domain and target domain is not equal (i.e., p(y|x_S) \\= p(y|x_T)  ), the optimal invariance can lead the same generalization problem.   Unfortunately, a lot of works has been done [1,2] in matching domain classifier or conditional probability.  It is desirable to discuss the difference between these two problems and compared with the missing references in experiments. \n\nIt is also suggested to conduct the analysis of why the datasets satisfy the assumption of the dependence of class and domains. \n\nReference:\n[1] Flexible Transfer Learning under Support and Model Shift, NIPS 2014.\n[2]Conditional Adversarial Domain Adaptation, NIPS 2018", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
