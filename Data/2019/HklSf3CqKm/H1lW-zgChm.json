{"title": "Non-smooth non-convex optimization approach to complete dictionary learning", "review": "This paper is a direct follow-up on the Sun-Qu-Wright non-convex optimization view on the Spielman-Wang-Wright complete dictionary learning approach. In the latter paper the idea is to simply realize that with Y=AX, X being nxm sparse and A a nxn rotation, one has the property that for m large enough, the rows of X will be the sparsest element of the subspace in R^m generated by the rows of Y. This leads to a natural non-convex optimization problem, whose local optimum are hopefully the rows of X. This was proved in SWW for *very* sparse X, and then later improved in SQW to the linear sparsity scenario. The present paper refines this approach, and obtain slightly better sample complexity by studying the most natural non-convex problem (ell_1 regularization on the sphere).\n\n\nI am not an expert on SQW so it is hard to evaluate how difficult it was to extend their approach to the non-smooth case (which seems to be the main issue with ell_1 regularization compared to the surrogate loss of SQW).\n\n\nOverall I think this is a solid theoretical contribution, at least from the point of view of non-smooth non-convex optimization. I have some concerns about the model itself. Indeed *complete* dictionary learning seemed like an important first step in 2012 towards more general and realistic scenario. It is unclear to this reviewer whether the insights gained for this complete scenario are actually useful more generally.\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
