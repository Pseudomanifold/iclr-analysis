{"title": "An opaque presentation that is not well exploited", "review": "This paper introduces four \"low cost\" alternatives to the standard convolution operation that can be used in place of the standard convolution operation to reduce their computational complexity.  The particular architectures presented are motivated by their superficial resemblance to a Reaction-Diffusion model.\n\nThe attempt to connect the work in this paper with Reaction-Diffusion models, or with PDEs in general, is very poorly executed.  Explaining the low cost convolution operators in terms of RD models in Section 3 involves the use of non-standard notation, which makes the paper much more difficult to follow than necessary.\n\nAn unusual presentation could be justified if the connection to RD models were exploited in some useful way, but that does not seem to be the case here.  The only place the PDE connection is essential is in the definition of the implicit RD architecture, but according to table 2 this architecture appears to underperform the explicit RD architecture across the board.\n\nThe first sentence of Section 3.2.2 implies that the motivating theory suggests that the implicit architecture should outperform its explicit counterpart.  The fact that it convincingly does not do so draws the applicability of the motivation into question.\n\nThe proposed architectures achieve worse performance than the MobileNet baseline in almost all cases. In many cases the drop in performance is marginal but it is quite consistent.  The timing comparison would be more compelling if it also included a runtime comparison for some full architectures.\n\n\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
