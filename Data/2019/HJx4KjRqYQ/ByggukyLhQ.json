{"title": "simple idea that might be useful, but unnecessarily complicated exposition", "review": "This paper proposes training latent variable models (as in VAE decoders) by running HMC to approximate the posterior of the latents, and then estimating model parameters by maximizing the complete data log-likelihood. This is not a new idea by itself and is used e.g. as a baseline in Kingma and Welling's original VAE paper. The novelty in this paper is that it proposes tuning the parameters of the HMC inference algo by maximizing the likelihood achieved by the final sample in the MCMC chain. This seems to work well in practice and might be a useful method, but it is not clear under what conditions it should work.\n\nThe paper is written in an unnecessarily complicated and formal way. On first read it seems like the proposed method has much more formal justification than it really has. The discussion up to section 3.5 makes it seem as if there is some new kind of tractable variational bound (the ERLBO) that is optimized, but in practice the actual objective in equation 16 is simply the likelihood at the final sample of the MCMC chain, that is Monte Carlo EM as e.g. used by Kingma & Welling, 2013 as a baseline.  The propositions and theorems seem to apply to an idealized setting, but not to the actual algorithm that is used. They could have been put in an appendix, or even a reference to the exisiting literature on HMC would have sufficed.\n\nThe experiments do not clearly demonstrate that the method is much better than previous methods from the literature, although it is much more expensive. (The reported settings require 150 likelihood evaluations per example per minibatch update, versus 1 likelihood evaluation for a VAE). Also see my previous comments about evaluation in this paper's thread.\n\n- Please explain why tuning the HMC algo by maximizing eq 16 should work. I don't think it is a method that generally would work, e.g. if the initial sample z0 ~ q(z|x) is drawn from a data dependent encoder as in HVI (Salimans et al) then I would expect the step size of the HMC to simply go to zero as the encoder gets good. However in your case this does not happen as the initial sample is unconditional from x. Are there general guidelines or guarantees we can conclude from this?\n\n- The authors write \"Because MPFs are equivalent to ergodic Markov chains, the density obtained at the output of an MPF, that is, qL, will converge to the stationary distribution \u03c0 as L increases.\"\n\nThis is true for the idealized flow in continuous time, but HMC with finite step size does generally NOT converge to the correct distribution. This is why practical use of HMC includes a Metropolis-Hastings correction step. You omit this step in your algorithm, with the justification that we don't care about asymptotic convergence in this case. Fair enough, but then you should also omit all statements in the paper that claim that your method converges to the correct posterior in the limit. E.g. the writing makes it seem like Proposition 2 and Theorem 1 apply to your algorithm, but it in fact they do not apply for finite step size. Maybe the statements are still correct if we take the limit with L->inf and the stepsize delta->0 at a certain rate? This is not obvious to me.\n\nIn practice, you learn the stepsize delta. Do we have any guarantees this will make delta go to zero at the right rate as we increase the number of steps L? I.e. is this statement from your abstract true? -> \"we propose a novel method which is scalable, like mean-field VI, and, due to its theoretical foundation in ergodic theory, is also asymptotically accurate\". (convergence of uncorrected HMC only holds in the idealized case with step size -> 0)", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
