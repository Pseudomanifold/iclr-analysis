{"title": "The proposed method has no guarantee, and lacks enough details to repeat the experiments.", "review": "This paper aims to the problem of domain  shift.  The key idea is to introduce a collaborative low-rank reconstructive layer. Though experiments are conducted to verify effectiveness of the proposed method, there exist many problems in the draft.\n\n1.  Why can low-rank representation help to relieve the domain shift problem? It seems that the authors lack good insights about this problem. Also, more convincing experiments should be done to illuminate how  the collaborative low-rank representation help to address the domain shift problem.  \n\n2. Another concern is the generalization of the proposed method. By introducing  the collaborative low-rank representation, the authors expect that the proposed method is less sensitive to the domain shift. However, the collaborative low-rank reconstructive layer is learnt from data sets. How do the authors guarantee the generalization of the learnt weights? \n\n3. The authors do not show the concrete architecture of the collaborative low-rank reconstructive layer.  The readers can not repeat the model. \n\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
