{"title": "Problem and framework not well explained", "review": "The motivation of the work is not clear but the novelty seems to be present.\n\nThe paper is very hard to follow as the problem description and intuition of the D-GAN is not clearly written.\n\nBased on the experiments, the proposed method achieves marginal improvement in terms of F1 score but sometimes also slightly lower performance than other GAN based such as PGAN, so the impact of this work to solve positive unlabelled data problem is not evident. \n\nI am personally not as familiar with the PU problem and existing frameworks so my confidence in the assessment is low; my main experience is in the computer vision for autonomous driving and sparse coding.\n\nBut my feeling is this paper is marginally below the threshold of acceptance.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess"}
