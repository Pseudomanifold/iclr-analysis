{"title": "Good Paper", "review": "The paper presents algorithms for optimization using sign-SGD when the access is restricted to a zero order oracle only, and provide detailed analysis and convergence rates. They also run optimization experiments on synthetic data. Additionally, they demonstrate superiority of the algorithm in the number of oracle calls for black box adversarial attacks for MNIST and CIFAR-10. The provided algorithm has optimal iteration complexity from a theoretical viewpoint. \n\nThe paper was, overall very well written and sufficient experiment were presented. The math also seems correct. However, I think they should have explained the motivation for the need of developing such an algorithm better. Section 3 can be improved. \n\nI think this is an important paper because it provides a guaranteed algorithm for zero order sign-gradient descent. However, the ideas and the estimators are not novel. They show applicability of standard gradient estimators for zero order oracles for sign-sgd algorithm.
