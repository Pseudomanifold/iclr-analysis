{"title": "why is this an important problem?", "review": "The authors provide an algorithm that aims to compute optimal value functions and policies as a function of a set of constraints.  The ideas used for designing the algorithm seem reasonable.  However, I don't fully understand the motivation here.  Given a set of constraints, one can simply carry out value iteration with what the authors call the scalarized reward in order to generate an optimal policy.  Why go through the effort to compute things in a manner parameterized by the constraints?  Perhaps the intention is to use this for sensitivity analysis, though the authors do not discuss that?\n\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}
