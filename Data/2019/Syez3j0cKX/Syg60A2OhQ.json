{"title": "This paper points out the limitation of IRGAN but it  is better to submit to SIGIR.", "review": "This paper is closely related to the SIGIR 2017 paper \u201cIRGAN: A minimax game for unifying generative and discriminative information retrieval models\u201d. The SIGIR paper proposed a Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN) model for Information Retrieval (IRGAN). And in this paper, the authors dissect the IRGAN model and figure out that the discriminator and generator of IRGAN are optimizing directly opposite loss functions. They also provide experimental studies and show that the superiority of IRGAN in the experiments are mainly because of the discriminator maximizing the likelihood of the real data and not because of the generator.  \nStrong Points:\nConsidering that the IRGAN becomes popular after it being published, I should say the analyzing of this paper is important for researchers in the IR domain.\n\nConcerns or Suggestions:\n1.\tExcept the analyzing on IRGAN, the contribution of this paper is limited. Most of the parts of this paper introduce GAN and IRGAN. Only Section 5 focuses on the analyzing. The methods claimed new proposed, Single Discriminator and Co-training, are good for supporting the analyzing but they are not quite novel.\n2.\tIt is strange to introduce the two models, Single Discriminator and Co-training in the experimental setting section. I would suggest to separate them out and introduce them earlier.\n3.\tThe topic of this paper is more related to the IR domain. It will be better to publish it in SIGIR, together with the IRGAN paper.\n4.\tBesides, if it is possible, I would suggest researchers who have direct experiences on the implement and study on IRGAN give more comments on this paper.
