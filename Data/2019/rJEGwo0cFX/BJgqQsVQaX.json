{"title": "The paper is not prepared for acceptance", "review": "The paper aims to learn interactions between agents based on an attention-based model. I admit that the paper is interesting and well motivated, but it is still far from being publishable. The reasons are the following:\n\nFirst, the authors claim that DIAN is an attention-based mechanism spanning over both time and graph structure, and also based on different edge representation than Hohsen (2017) and Velickovic (2017). Some of the differences are mentioned in the introduction, but why such differences are necessary or are increasing the merit of the problem in general?\n\nSecond, the paper claims it is different than Kipf (2018) which considers independent edge interactions. Instead, they consider global views. Such statements are particularly vague.  \n\nThird, what is the objective function in their learning mechanism? Did I somehow miss that? Could the authors refer to where they are pointed out?\n\nFourth, despite there are papers which consider attention over graph structure, I am a bit skeptical because for graphs we have short diameters and then why we really need attention in such case?\n\nApart from these, the presentation of the paper is too poor.  The abstract contains, \"we argue to scale such network design...\" . Somehow, that is a bit misleading. If I understand correctly, the entire model lies over an underlying network, not network processing.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
