{"title": "An application paper below the acceptance bar", "review": "This paper proposes to apply attention mechanism to process message passing in a graph over time. It suffers from the following limitations:\n\n- The problem definition is unclear. What is the objective of the proposed model? Predict the attributes of a specific node or all the nodes? Forecast the types or weights of edges? Dynamically change the graph architecture? It is vague in the elaboration. The authors should prove precise and concise mathematical definitions of the task.\n\n- The background discussion is inadequate. As the proposed method is a follow-up research of GNN, the authors should present more discussions on previous GNN, GCN, and message passing designs.\n\n- The technique contribution is limited.  In my opinion, the proposed framework is a straightforward simplification of a general GNN design. The authors highlight their contributions on sub-graph (neighbors) operation over time. Nevertheless, this is nature consideration or built-in design in a GNN with message passing mechanism.\n\n- The proposed applying attention mechanism in graph operation is nothing new without a comprehensive design. For instance, does the proposed method can be scaled up for a high-degree graph? There is no discussion or analysis but only empirical descriptions. \n\n- What does it by claiming \"DIAN do not have a different network for each edge type, but only different encoders for a given node and its neighbors.\" If \"edge type\" means different modalities or embeddings of different dimensions, the proposed method can not handle different edge type by simply using an RNN encoder either. \n\n- Equation (1) should be removed or it is necessary to explain what Q and K represent.\n\n- Typos. \"... the a given node...\" and etc.", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
