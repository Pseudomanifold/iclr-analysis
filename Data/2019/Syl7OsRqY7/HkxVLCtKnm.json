{"title": "Method that is well adapted to the task to be solved; clear and well written", "review": "This paper proposes a method for multi-hop QA based on two separate modules, which are called coarse-grained and fine-grained modules. The coarse-grained module reads all of the supporting documents for QA, whereas the fine-grained one reads the local context surrounding each candidate entity's mentions. Both modules are used to predict the score of a candidate entity being the answer, with the final result being the sum of the two scores.\n\nThis is a fine paper and achieves a new state of the art on the Qangaroo multi-hop QA dataset. The paper is clearly written, presents the models intuitively, while not foregoing technical detail should that be interesting to a reader. I appreciated the ablation results, as well as the qualitative analyses. The overall idea of encoding different levels of context is an important one, and I am glad that this paper shows that this approach works for a complex QA task.\n\nThere are two downsides to the paper. The first is that I am not sure it is really accurate to call the coarse-grained model as such, as it still seems to require passing every word in the supporting documents to an encoder. It seems to be more aimed at capturing global information from the supporting documents, rather than to make a quick, high-level pass at inference. The second weakness is that the coarse- and fine-grained modules barely interact at all, as their prediction scores are simply summed at the output layer. It is nice that even such a simple method of interaction already works so well, but I would have expected some exploration or comment on how more interactions could be enabled.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
