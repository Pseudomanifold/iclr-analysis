{"title": "Actor critic for sequence labeling; not very novel but good results on transliteration; inadequate comparison", "review": "The authors propose actor-critic method for sequence labeling and show that it performs better (is more stable than) other RL approaches and also outperforms other techniques for countering exposure bias like scheduled sampling.\n\nThe results show very small improvement in tagging tasks like NER and CCG supertagging compared to other approaches ; but they show good improvement in the transliteration task which is more of a transduction task than a tagging task. \n\nThis authors also discus the adjusted training procedure which accounts for bad performance of the critic model in the initial stages of training. The approach is not very novel because actor-critic for more general sequence-to-sequence models (arguably more complex than tagging) has already been explored in the literature (Bahdanau et al., cited by the authors). Major difference in the proposed approach is the use of stepwise hamming-loss based reward and it is unclear whether this is a major contribution which  sets it apart from the previous work on AC for sequence modeling. For example, a good comparison would be to do tagging in seq2seq style and use the approach proposed in the existing AC work to show the value of the approach proposed here.\n\nAlso, minor claims about thoroughness of comparison with CRF are ill-founded as previous published work on tagging has indeed compared CRFs, independent, LSTM/RNN based models.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
