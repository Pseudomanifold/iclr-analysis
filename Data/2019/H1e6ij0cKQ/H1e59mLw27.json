While I admire the thoroughness of  both the algorithmic work and experimental setup, I am afraid the paper suffers from two major problems:\n\n1. The paper suffers from serious clarity issues. Particularly, the main problem the paper deals with - exposure bias- is not well explained. I admit that while I am working with RNNs on a regular basis, I was not familiar with this problem. Unfortunately, I was also not able to understand it from the paper.  This may be a very basic concept, but a paper must be self-contained. Unfortunately, after reading the paper, front to cover, I cannot tell what is the problem the authors are trying to solve (except, of course, from providing a better training algorithm for RNNs).\n\n2. As the authors say already in the abstract, one of the best performing models on structured NLP tasks is LSTM-CRF, which combines the power of both the neural and the structured prediction frameworks. However, the authors do not compare their solution to LSTM-CRF, but only to LSTM and to CRF. This is a very important baseline, and without a proper comparison it is hard to evaluation the contribution of this paper.\n\n\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
