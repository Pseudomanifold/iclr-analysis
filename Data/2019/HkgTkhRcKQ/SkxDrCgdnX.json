{"title": "Another fix of non-convergence of Adam -- AdaShift", "review": "In this paper, the authors found that decorrelating $v_t$ and $g_t$ fixes the non-convergence issue of Adam. Motivated by that, AdaShift that uses a temporal decorrelation technique is proposed. Empirical results demonstrate the superior performance of AdaShift compared to Adam and AMSGrad. My detailed comments are listed as below. \n\n1) Theorem 2-4 provides interesting insights on Adam. However, the obtained theoretical results rely on specific toy problems (6) and (13). In the paper, the authors mentioned that \"... apply the net update factor to study the behaviors of Adam using Equation 6 as an example. The argument will be extended to the stochastic online optimization problem and general cases.\" What did authors mean the general cases?\n\n2) The order of presenting Algorithm 1, 2 and Eq. (17) should be changed. I suggest to first present AdaShift (i.e., Eq. (17) or Algorithm 3 with both modified adaptive learning rate and moving average), and then elaborate on temporal decorrelation and others. AdaShift should be presented as a new Algorithm 1.  In experiments, is there any result associated with the current Algorithm 1 and 2? If no, why not compare in experiments? One can think that Algorithm 1 and 2 are adaptive learning rate methods against adaptive gradient methods (e.g., Adam, AMSGrad). \n\n3) Is there any convergence rate analysis of AdamShift even in the convex setting?\n\n4) The empirical performance of AdamShift is impressive. Can authors mention more details on how to set the hyperparameters for AdamShift, AMSGrad, Adam, e.g., learning rate, \\beta 1, and \\beta 2? \n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
