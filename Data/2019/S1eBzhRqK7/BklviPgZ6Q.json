{"title": "Simple and intuitive idea, insufficiently convincing results", "review": "Review: \nThe paper introduces a novel way to do architecture search that uses an RNN to guide the mutation operation. The method and the motivation of the idea as long with the related work are all clearly described. However, the experiments section does not show a big uplift of the method versus the baselines and the number of types of tasks is relatively small (artificial and text). \n\nCons:\n- No image task\n- No large scale task to show the scalability\n- No baselines that are not coming from AUTO-ML to show the relative performance of a classical method", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}
