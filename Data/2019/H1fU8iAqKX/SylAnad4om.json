{"title": "Interesting work on matching CNN filters to Neurons", "review": "The paper analyses the data collected from 6005 neurons in a mouse brain. Visual stimuli are presented and the responses of the neurons recorded. In the next step, a rotational equivariant neural network architecture together with a sparse coding read-out layer is trained to predict the neuron responses from the stimuli. Results show a decent correlation between neuron responses and trained network. Moreover, the rotational equivariant architecture beats a standard CNN with similar number of feature maps. The analysis and discussion of the results is interesting. Overall, the methodological approach is good.\n\nI have trouble understanding the plot in Figure 4, it also does not print well and is barely readable on paper.\n\nI have a small problem Figure 6 where \"optimal\" response-maps are presented. From my understanding, many of those feature maps are not looking similar to feature maps that are usually considered. Given the limited data available and the non-perfect modeling of neurons, the computed optimal response-map might include features that are not present in the dataset. Therefore, it would be interesting to compare those results with the stimuli used to gather the data. E.g. for a subset of neurons, one could pick the stimulus that created the maximum response and compare that to what the stimulus with the maximum response of the trained neuron was. It might be useful to include the average correlation of the neurons belong to each of the 16 groups(if there are any meaningful differences), especially as the cut-off of \"correlation 0.2 on the validation set\" is rather low.\n\nNote: I am not an expert in the neural-computation literature, I am adapting the confidence rating accordingly.", "rating": "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
