{"title": "Promising idea, but results could be better.", "review": "Summary of the paper:\nThe authors propose a framework called Mahe that provides context-dependent and context-free explanations for a given (neural network) model\u2019s prediction. Context-dependent explanations are found by applying NID (Tsang et al, 2018) on a set of data points sampled from a neighborhood around the given input point. Further, the generalized additive model representing the function approximation around the given input is incrementally built by selectively computing higher-order-interaction terms using NID again. Each such added term results in an explanation at a level in the hierarchy. Context-free explanations are generated in two ways: 1) when a local explanation shows same polarity among all valid data points, and 2) by negating the local explanations\u2019 polarity at a data point, fine-tuning the model on the resulting modified function approximation, and regenerating the local explanations for other data points; if the polarity is reversed for all other data points, then the local explanation is also a global explanation\n\nStrengths:\n- Broadens the application of NID to provide hierarchical explanations and context-free explanations\n- Experiments on context-free explanations show promising results, for instance, on the Sentiment-LSTM model and in Supplementary A. Would be great to see more results on this front. \n\nQuestions for authors:\n- The experimental results only show that using higher order interactions results in a better function approximation (explanation), but explanations for level > 2 do not seem to be that good (Table 5). For the image example, they look slightly better. \n- The contribution seems incremental, given that Tsang et al (2018) already explored explanations based on interactions. \n\nConclusion\nConsidering that the NID idea has been broadened to context-free explanations, the paper shows promise, but it is a weak accept because the other contributions do not seem fully worked out. \n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
