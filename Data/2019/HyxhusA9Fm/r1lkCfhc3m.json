{"title": "A realistic dataset on dialogs for navigation, with a report of some early studies", "review": "The paper introduces a new dataset \"Talk the Walk\" that are dialogs\nbetween a guide and a tourist, where the guide is to help the tourist\nnavigate to a target location.  The guide has access to a map and the\ntarget location, but he relies on the tourist to communicate her\nstate (location) by natural language.\n\nPros.:\n\nThe task represented in the dataset can be highly challenging, and\nrespectable effort went into creating the dataset based on real city\nneighborhoods.   The description and analysis of the dataset are\ndetailed.  The paper is well written up to the end of page 3.\n\nThe dataset by itself is a good contribution to the scientific\ncommunity when it is shared.  There could be many topics open\nfor studying within the same data.\n\nThe list of references and related work is exceptionally thorough\nand useful for researchers interested in the topic.\n\nCons.:\n\nThe description of the experiments done with the dataset, however,\nsuffers from being overly cryptic.  The methods are not sufficiently\nmotivated, very few alternatives are presented and argued against,\nand the several sections give a dry report of the sequences of things\nthe authors did.  It is not clear how others may find value in the\nresults and conclusions.\n\nWhile the paper opens with the emphasis of a real-world setting,\nafter a series of simplifications (e.g. landmark typing, perfect perception)\nit seems that much of the full complexity of the natural task is taken out,\nand the main goal of the study is no longer clear.\nFor example, since there are only 9 types of landmarks,\nin a small neighborhood there are not many combinations to draw reference to.\nSimple observation sequences of such can easily narrow down the location\nuncertainty.  It is important to highlight what the remaining open\nissues are that make the task still challenging.\n\nMisc.:\n\nExamples are missing in the discussion of the experimental tasks.\ne.g. in the study of emergent language, what could be a message that a\ntourist may generate to describe his location?  what makes it hard for\nthe guide to decode it?  Likewise, what could be an example state of\nthe tourist and the description of that state in natural language?\nWithout the examples, it is difficult for the reader to have a sense\nof the challenges in each task.\n\nTable 8 is the first place where (finally) some utterances are presented.\nHowever the description in the table or in the text is not sufficient\nto convey the point that is supposed to be explained by the example.\n\nThe descriptions of the landmarks are restricted to the type of business\nat the location with 9 possibilities.  Is the list of 9 exhaustive?\nAre there any exceptions  (e.g. schools)?  How are such exceptions\nrepresented and treated in the dialogs?\n\nTo what extent the difficulty of the tasks depends on the variability\nof the combination of landmarks visible at each location?\n\nWhat could be a simplest way to do this without neural-modeling?\ne.g. with the many limitations that are built into the task and its\nrepresentations, will a simple decision tree based instruction method suffice?\nOr a traditional algorithm that relies on repeated exploration and evaluation?\nIt is surprising that such possibilities are not even mentioned.\nA complex neural architecture does not seem to be well justified unless\nit is motivated by the need to overcome limitations of a classical method.\n\nIrrelevant to the research effort, a thought about the dataset is that,\nin these days with popular uses of GPS, the reliance on such dialogs for\nnavigation feels a bit backwards.\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
