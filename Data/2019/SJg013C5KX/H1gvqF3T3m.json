{"title": "Major presentation issues", "review": "In this paper, the authors propose a new technique called Teaching to Teach via Structured Dark Knowledge for curriculum learning.  See my comments below.\n\nI don\u2019t like this paper because it is full of buzzwords, and it is really poorly written. The author first started in the abstract on \u201chyper deep learners\u201d, which confuses me a lot. It is unclear to me what type of deep learning models that you are aiming for and what exactly \u201chyper deep learners\u201d are. Also, in the abstract, the authors mention Structured Dark Knowledge, but they have not discussed it in the introduction, which makes it extremely hard for the readers to understanding the relationship between this work and the so called \u201cStructured Dark Knowledge\u201d. \n\nThe 3.2 is also poorly written and insufficiently motivated. The term Structured Dark Knowledge sounds fancy, but I fail to see what the structures are. It sounds like the authors just propose \u201cTraining Subset\u201d as Structured Dark Knowledge, which is extremely misleading. This work gives people an impression that you are trying to leverage external knowledge for curriculum learning, it turns out it is not the case.\n\nIn section 4.1, the hyperparameters\u2019 setting seems to be mysterious. It is unclear to me how the authors come up with magic numbers like 0.04, 0.1, 15%. \n\nIn Figure 2, the improvements from SDK do not look like it is very impressive. And also 4.2 the datasets are too small. The metric in Table 4 is poorly chosen. I don\u2019t understand what the numbers mean un Table 4 and how significant they are. Please use standard metrics. \n\nThe future stock price regression experiments are also poorly presented. In Table 5, the authors do not explain what the price, percentage and error mean. It only says \u201cResults\u201d. Please pick common benchmark datasets and well-known metrics. \n\nOverall, this paper is poorly written, and it has not met the requirement of ICLR.\n\n\n", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
