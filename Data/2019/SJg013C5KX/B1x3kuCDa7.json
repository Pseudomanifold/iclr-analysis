{"title": "review", "review": "Summary\n==============\nThis paper proposes \"teaching to teach\". A drawback of existing curriculum learning approaches is that it requires a human to manually and heuristically define a curriculum. Teaching to teach avoids this using a teacher model to perform subset selection, and reweighting the data points based on the teacher loss. \n\nEvaluation\n==============\nUnfortunately, after reading section 3 a few times I am still not 100% clear on the exact methodology. It could be lack of background on my part, but I find the presentation extremely confusing, and unnecessarily verbose/florid. Also I am not exactly sure how the proposed methodology relates to Hinton et al's \"knowledge distillation\", which trains a (typically smaller) student model to mimic the output from a teacher model. The empirical study seems to be strong however, with applications across various domains/datasets and sensible baselines.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess"}
