{"title": "An interesting and relevant paper with poor justification for study design and analysis", "review": "\nSUMMARY\n\nThis paper argues that most recent gains in visual recognition are due to the use of visual attention mechanisms in deep convolutional networks (DCNs). According to the authors; the networks learn where to focus through a weak form of supervision based on image class labels. This paper introduces a data set that complements ImageNet with circa 500,000 human-derived attention maps, obtained through a large-scale online experiment called ClickMe. These attention maps can be used in conjunction with DCNs to add a human-in-the-loop feature that significantly improves accuracy.\n\nREVIEW\n\nThis paper is clearly within scope of the ICLR conference and addresses a relevant and challenging problem: that of directing the learning process in visual recognition tasks to focus on interesting or useful regions. This is achieved by leveraging a human-in-the-loop approach.\n\nThe paper does a fair job in motivating the research problem and describing what has been done so far in the literature to address the problem. The proposed architecture and the data collection online experiment are also described to a sufficient extent.\n\nIn my view, the main issue with this paper is the reporting of the experiment design and the analysis of the results. Many of the design choices of the experiments are simply listed and not motivated at all. The reader has to accept the design choices without any justification. The results for accuracy are simply listed in a table and some results are indicated as \u201cp<0.01\u201d but the statistical analysis is never described. Interpretability is highlighted in the abstract and introduction as an important feature of the proposed approach but the evaluation of interpretability is limited to a few anecdotes from the authors\u2019 review of the results. The paper does not present a procedure or measure for evaluating interpretability.\n\nOTHER SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT\n\n- The verb \u201cattend\u201d is used in many places where \u201cfocus\u201d seems to be more appropriate.\n\n- \u201cwe ran a rapid experiment\u201d: what does rapid mean in this context?\n\n- \u201cthe proposed GALA architecture is grounded in visual neuroscience\u201d : this and many other statements are only elaborated upon in the appendix. I understand that page limit is always an issue but I think it is important to prioritise this and similar motivations and put at least a basic description in the main body\n\nUPDATE\n\nMy most serious concerns have been addressed in the revised version.\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
