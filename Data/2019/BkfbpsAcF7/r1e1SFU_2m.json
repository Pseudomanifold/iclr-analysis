{"title": "The ideas are appealing and should enventually lead to fine contributions but the paper is disbalanced with wrong detail distribution ", "review": "The paper focuses on adversarial vulnerability of neural networks, and more specifically on perturbation-based versus invariance-based adversarial examples and how using bijective networks (with so-called metameric sampling) may help overcoming issues related to invariance. The approach is used to get around insufficiencies of cross-entropy-based information-maximization, as illustrated on experiments where the proposed variation on CE outperforms CE. \n\nWhile I am not a neural network expert, I felt that the ideas developed in the paper are worthwhile and should eventally lead to useful contributions and be published. This being said, I did not find the paper in its present form to be fit for publication in a high-tier conference or journal. The main reason for this is the disbalance between the somehow heavy and overly commented first four pages (especially in Section 2) contrasting with the surprisingly moderate level of detail when it comes to bijective networks, supposedly the heart of the actual original contribution. To me this is severely affecting the overall quality of the paper. The contents of sections 3 and 4 seem relevant, but I struggled find out what precisely is the main contribution in the end, probably because of the lack of detail on bijective networks mentioned before. Again, I am not an expert, and I will indicate that in the system of course, but while I cannot completely judge all aspects of the technical relevance and the originality of the approach, I am fairly convinced that the paper deserves to be substantially revised before it can be accepted for publication.   \n\nEdit: After paper additions I am changing my score to a 6. ", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}
