{"title": "Extension of AmbientGAN on denoising and demixing problems\uff0c but experiments are not sufficient", "review": "This paper proposed two new GAN structures for learning a generative modeling using the superposition of two structured components. These two structures can be viewed as an extension of AmbientGAN. Experiments results on MNIST dataset are presented. Overall, the demixing-GAN structure is relatively novel. However, the potential application seems limited and the experiment result is not sufficient enough to support the idea. Detail comments are as following,\n\n\n1.\tIt seems there are no independent assumption imposed on the addition of two generators. It is possible that the possible model only will works on simple toy example, where the distributions of two structured components are drastic different. Or the performance will be affected by the initialization.  It would be nice if the author test this on more realistic examples, such as the source separation problem in acoustic or the unmixing problem in hyper-spectral images. More detail information about the experiments setting, such as the methods used to initialize the two generators are need. \n2.\tIn the experiment part, it would be nice to have Quantitive results presented, for example PSNR for denoising. Simple comparison with several traditional methods could also help understanding the advantage of the model.\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
