{"title": "good review but could be lacking in terms of contribution", "review": "In this paper, the authors study the feature attribution problem as feature selection (exclusive and inclusive).  The authors go through previous work, provide definitions and attempt to answer questions that are relevant to this task.  The authors provide several experiments in order to empirically evaluate which of the two feature selection approaches is better suited for feature attibution.  Although this is a good review, and the motivation is sound, I think that much more ellaboration, and experiments on more than 200 images, would be required to reach definitive conclusions.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
