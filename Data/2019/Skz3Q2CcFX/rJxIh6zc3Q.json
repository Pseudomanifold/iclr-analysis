{"title": "interesting but not clear how useful", "review": "To the best of my understanding the paper proposes some methodological ideas for visualizing and analyzing representations. \nThe paper is unclear mainly because it is a bit difficult to pinpoint the contribution and its audience. What would help me better understand and potentially raise my rating is an analysis of a classical model on a known dataset as a case study and some interesting findings would help make it more exciting and give the readers more incentives to try this out. Like train an AlexNet and VGG imagenet model and show that the embeddings are better aligned with the wordnet taxonomy in one of the other. This should be possible with their approach if i understand it correctly. \n\npros:\n- visualization and analysis is a very exciting and important topic in machine learning\n- this is clearly useful if it worked\ncons:\n- not sure what the contribution claim for the paper is since these types of plots existed already in the literature (is it a popularization claim ?)", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
