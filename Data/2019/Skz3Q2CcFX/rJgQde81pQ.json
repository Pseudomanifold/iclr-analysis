{"title": "ideas seems a common practice in various prior visualization tasks", "review": "Paper presented a new and simple method to visualize the embedding space geometry rather than standard t-SNE or PCA. The key is to carefully select items to be visualized/embed and interpretable dimensions. A few case study and user study were conducted to show the benefit of the proposed approach. \n\n- on algebraic formulae (AF): it would be good to clarify the def of AF explicitly. Rules/extention/axes are not very clear and mathematically consistent in section 3. Would projection idea be applied to arbitrary AFs?\n\n- while the idea being simple, I am not quite confident about the novelty. For example for the de-bias application, Bolukbasi et al. had already did the same plot along the he-she axis. Similar plots on the polysemous word embedding can be found in Arora et al., 2017, etc. \n\n- The user study with n=10 are typically less reliable for any p-value evaluation. \n\n", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
