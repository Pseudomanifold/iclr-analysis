{"title": "an ok paper but not good enough", "review": "This paper introduces feedback connection to enhance feature learning through incorporating context information. \n\nA similar idea has been explored by (Li, et al. 2018). Compared with that work, the novelty of this work is weaken and seems limited. The difference from Li is not very clear. The authors need to give more discussion. Furthermore, experimental comparison with Li et al. 2018 is also necessary. \n\nThe performance gain is limited. The authors mainly evaluate their method for noisy image classification. Such application is very narrow and deviates a bit from realistic scenarios.
