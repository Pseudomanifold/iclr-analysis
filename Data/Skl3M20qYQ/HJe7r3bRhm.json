{"title": "Interesting perspective, but not strong enough results", "review": "The paper proposes a new objective function for learning disentangled representations in a variational framework, building on the beta-VAE work by Higgins et al, 2017. The approach attempts to minimise the synergy of the information provided by the independent latent dimensions of the model. Unfortunately, the authors do not properly evaluate their newly proposed Non-Syn VAE, only providing a single experiment on a toy dataset and no quantitative metric results. Furthermore, even qualitatively the proposed model is shown to perform no better than the existing factor-VAE baseline.\n\nI commend the authors for taking a multi-disciplinary perspective and bringing the information synergy ideas to the area of unsupervised disentangled representation learning. However, the resulting Non-Syn VAE objective function is effectively a different derivation of the original beta-VAE objective. If the authors want to continue with the synergy minimisation approach, I would recommend that they attempt to use it as a novel interpretation of the existing disentangling techniques, and maybe try to develop a more robust disentanglement metric by following this line of reasoning. Unfortunately, in the current form the paper is not suitable for publication.\n\n", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
