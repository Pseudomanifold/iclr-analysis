{"title": "Extension of HREDGan", "review": "This paper uses the idea from 'A Persona-Based Neural Conversation Model' by Li et al and incrementally applies it to the 'Multi-turn Dialogue Response Generation in an Adversarial Learning Framework' work-in-progress by Olabiyi et al. The paper by Olabiyi uses the idea of adversarial training to the HRED work by Xing et al (Hierarchical Recurrent Attention Network for Response Generation). The paper shows very promising results for controlling the response generation based on input attributes with adversarial training. Compared to the persona based model, this work seems to outperform that model significantly as reported in Table 1 (in terms of Perplexity/Bleu). It would have been great to see the quantitative comparison in terms of other metrics (if the authors could try to reproduce their results). There are other interesting ways to incorporate attribute information into the dialogue model such as reported in the work of Lee et al (SCALABLE SENTIMENT FOR SEQUENCE-TO-SEQUENCE CHATBOT RESPONSE WITH PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS) - since this paper is primarily about personalization of responses - a comparison to some of the methods used in Lee's work would have been very relevant and made the paper much more convincing in terms of core contributions. The model and architecture is pretty convincing but the paper lacks more in-depth analysis, comparison and evaluation of the model.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
