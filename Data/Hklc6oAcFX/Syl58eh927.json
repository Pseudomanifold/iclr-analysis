{"title": "lack of novelty", "review": "The manuscript proposes a co-manifold learning approach for missing data.  The problem is important, but the method is lack of novelty. \nPros: important problem setting, Good experimental results.\nCons: the method is lack of novelty.\n\nIn detail, the method just simply combines a loss for competing missing values, which is not new,  and Laplacian losses for rows and columns, which are also not new. I don't see much novelty in the model.  \n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
