{"title": "A joint method for filling missing values and emdedding rows & columns, but not convincing", "review": "This paper presents a joint learning method for filling missing value and bi-clustering. The method extends (Chi et al. 2017), using a penalized matrix approximation. The proposed method is tested on three data sets, where two are synthetic and one small real-world data matrix. The presented method is claimed to be better than two classical approaches Nonlinear PCA and Diffusion Maps.\n\n1) Filling missing values is not new. Even co-clustering with missing values also exists. It is insufficient to defeat two methods which are older than ten years. More extensive comparison is needed but lacking here. Why not first use a dedicated method such as MICE or collaborative filtering, and then run embedding method on rows and columns?\n\n2) The purpose of the learning is unclear. The title does not give any hint about the learning goal. The objective function reads like filling missing values. The subsequent text claims that minimizing such a objective can achieve biclustering. However, in the experiment, the comparison is done via visualization and normal clustering (k-means).\n\n3) The empirical results are not convincing. Two data sets are synthetic. The only real-world data set is very small. Why k-means was used? How to choose k in k-means?\n\n4) The choice Omega function after Proposition 1 needs to be elaborated. A function curve plot could also help.\n\n5) What is Omega' in Eq. 2?", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
