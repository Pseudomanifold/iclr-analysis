{"title": "Review of \"Trellis Networks for Sequence Modeling\"", "review": "The authors propose a family of deep architecture (Trellis Networks ) for sequence modelling. Paper is well written and very well connected to existing literature. Furthermore, papers organization allows one to follow easily.  Trellis Networks bridge truncated RNN and temporal convolutional networks. Furthermore, proposed architecture is easy to extend and couple with existing RNN modules e.g. LSTM Trellis networks. Authors support their claims with an extensive empirical evidence. The proposed architecture is better than existing networks.\nAlthough the proposed method has several advantages, I would like to see what makes proposed architecture better than existing methods.\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
