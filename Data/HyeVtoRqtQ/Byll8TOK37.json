{"title": "Review", "review": "This paper introduces a novel architecture for sequence modeling, called the trellis network. The trellis network is in a sense a combination of RNNs and CNNs. The authors give a constructive proof that the trellis network is a special case of a truncated RNN. It also resembles CNNs since the neurons at higher levels have bigger receptive fields. As a result, techniques from RNN and CNN literature can be conveniently brought in and adapted to trellis network. The proposed method is evaluated on benchmark tasks and shows performance gain over existing methods.\n\nThe paper is well-written and easy to follow. The experimental study is extensive. The reviewer believes that this paper will potentially inspire future research along this direction. However, the novelty of the proposed method compared to the TCN seems limited: only weight sharing and input injection. It would be great to include the performance of the TCN on the PTB dataset, on both word and character levels in Table 1 and 2.\n\nAccording to Theorem 1, to model an M-truncated L-layer RNN, a trellis network needs M + L \u2212 1 layers. When M is large, it seems that a trellis network needs to be deep. Although this does not increase to model size due to weight sharing, does it significantly increase computation time, both during training and inference?\n\nThe review might have missed it, but what is the rationale behind the dotted link in Figure 1a, or the dependence of the activation function $f$ on $z_t^{(i)}$? It seems that it is neither motivated by RNNs nor CNNs. From RNN's point of view, as shown in the proof of Theorem 1, $f$ only depends on its first argument. From CNN's point of view, the model still gets the same reception field without using $z_t^{(i)}$.\n\nMinor comments:\nThe authors might want to give the full name of TCN (temporal convolutional networks) and a short introduction in Section 2 or at the beginning of Section 4.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
