{"title": "Extending dynamical systems view to higher order ODE solvers", "review": "This paper is based on an interpretation of so-called Residual Deep Networks as a discrete realization of some dynamical system. So far, work in this area used simple, Euler-forward like discretization schemes, while the paper at hand proposes to apply higher order Runge-Kutta Methods. This approach allows also to give a different interpretation of DenseNets and CliqueNets.\n\nThe general idea of this paper is interesting. Given that it is along a position paper, I think that the small set of experiments is acceptable to demonstrate the principle. What I miss however, is a clear exposition of the detailed approach. The paper lacks a lot in clarity and quality of presentation. I also think that trying to connect the presented approach to the ventral stream in the visual cortex confuses more than it helps.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
