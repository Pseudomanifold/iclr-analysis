{"title": "many things unclear, experiments not convincing enough, writing needs improvement.", "review": "The paper makes its intent plainly clear, it wants to remove the assumption that demonstrations are optimal.  Thus it should show that in a case that some demonstrations are bad, it outperforms other methods which assume they are all good. The method proposed, while interesting, well-conceived and potentially novel, is not convincingly tested to this end. \n\nThe paper should also show that the method can detect the bad demonstrations, and select the good demonstrations. \n\nThe experiments are on toy tasks and not existing tasks in the literature. Why not use an existing dataset/domain and simply noise up the demonstrations?\n\nFurthermore, many crucial details are omitted, such as the nature of the heuristic function K, and how precisely the weighting $c_i$ is adapted (section 4.4). Is it done by gradient descent? We would have to know what K is, and if it is differentiable to know this.\n\nAlso the writing itself needs a thorough revision.\n\nI think there may well be promise in the method, but it does not appear ready for publication.\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
