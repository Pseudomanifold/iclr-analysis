{"title": "A good problem discussed and the proposed ML approach seems reasonable.", "review": "The authors are proposing an end-to-end learning-based framework that can be incorporated into all classical frequency estimation algorithms in order to learn the underlying nature of the data in terms of the frequency in data streaming settings and which does not require labeling. According to my understanding, the other classical streaming algorithms also do not require labeling but the novelty here I guess lie in learning the oracle (HH) which feels like a logical thing to do as such learning using neural networks worked well for many other problems.\n\nThe problem formulation and applications of this research are well explained and the paper is well written for readers to understand. The experiments show that the learning based approach performs better than their all unlearned versions. \n\nBut the only negative aspect is the basis competitor algorithms are very simple in nature without any form of learning and that are very old. So, I am not sure if there are any new machine learning based frequency estimation algorithms.  \n\n\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
