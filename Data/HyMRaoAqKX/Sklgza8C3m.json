{"title": "Interesting models (with a potentially indifferent encoder?)", "review": "The paper presents two generative autoencoding models, that optimize a variational objective by adversarial training of implicit distributions. Applications in generative modeling, clustering, semi-supervised learning and disentangling \u201cglobal\u201d vs \u201clocal\u201d variations in data are presented. \n\nIn particular, the first model, called implicit autoencoder, maximizes the ELBO using two adversarial objectives: an adversarial regularizer penalizes the deviation of the aggregated posterior from the prior and the adversarial reconstruction penalizes the disagreement between the joint distribution and the joint reconstruction. Since both implicit distributions use a noise source, they can both explain variations in the data. The paper argues (and presents experimental results to suggest) that the global vs local information is the separation in these two components. The second architecture, called _flipped_ implicit autoencoder replaces the role of code and input in the first architecture, changing the training objective to reverse KL-divergence. The relationship between the proposed models to several prior works including ALI, BiGAN, AVB, adversarial autoencoders, wake-sleep, infoGAN is discussed. \n\nThe paper is nicely written, and the theory part seems to be sound. The strength of this paper is that it ties together a variety of different autoencoding generative architectures. In particular, I found it interesting that AVB and InfoGAN become special cases of the regular and flipped model, where an implicit term in the loss is replaced by an explicit likelihood term. \n\nI have some issues/questions (did I miss something obvious?):\n\n1) A mode of failure: suppose the encoder simply produces a garbled code that does not reflect that data manifold, yet it has the right aggregated posterior. In this case, the implicit generator and discriminator should ignore the code. However, the generator can still match the joint reconstruction and to the correct joint distribution. The loss can go towards its minimum. Note that this is not a problem in AVB.\n\n2) Global vs local info: a closely related issue to previous failure mode is that encoder has no incentive to produce informative codes. While the paper argues that the size of the code can decide the decomposition of local vs. global information, even for a wide bottleneck in the autoencoder, the code can have no (or very little) information.\n\n3) Could you please elaborate on the footnotes of page 3?", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
