{"title": "Interesting idea, Convince Results", "review": "This paper tends to address the instability problem in GAN training by replacing batch normalization(BN) with whitening and coloring transform(WC) to provide a full-feature decorrelation. This paper consider both uncondition and condition cases.\nIn general, the idea of replacing BN with WC is interesting and well motivated. \n\nThe proposed method looks novel to me. Compared with ZCA whitening in Huang et al. 2018, the Cholesky decomposition is much faster and performs better. The experiments show the promising results and demonstrate the proposed method is easily to integrate with other advanced technic. The experimental results also illustrate the role of each components and well supports the motivation of proposed method.\n\nMy only concern is that the proposed WC algorithm seems to have capability of applying to many tasks including discriminative scenario. This paper seems to have potential to be a more general paper about the WC method. Why just consider GAN? What is the performance of WC compared with BN/ZCA whiten in other tasks. It would be better if the authors can elaborate the motivation of choosing GAN as the application.
