{"title": "Review", "review": "In this paper the authors propose a neural model that, given a logical formula as input, predicts whether the formula is a tautology or not. Showing that a formula is a tautology is important because if we can classify a formula A -> B as a tautology then we can say that B is a logical consequence of A. The structure of the formula is a feedforward neural network built in a top-down manner. The leaves of this network are vectors (each of them represents a particular occurrence of an atom) which, after the construction of the formula, are processed by some recurrent neural networks.\n\nThe proposed approach seems interesting. However, my main doubt concerns the model. It seems to outperform the state-of-the-art, but the authors do not give any explanations why. There is no theoretical or intuitive explanation of why the model works. Why we need RNNs and not feedforward NNs? I think this is an big issue.\nIn conclusion, I think that the paper is a bit borderline. The model should be better explained. However, I think that the approach is compelling and, after a minor revision, the paper could be considered for acceptance.\n\n[Minor comments]\nPage 4. \n\u201cThe dataset contains train (99876 pairs)\u201d, pairs of what?\n\nPage 5. \nWhat is the measure of the values reported in Table 1?
