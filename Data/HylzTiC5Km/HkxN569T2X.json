{"title": "Sound incremental advance", "review": "Authors propose a decoder arquitecture model named Subscale Pixel Network. It is meant to generate overall images as image slice sequences with memory and computation economy by using a Multidimensional Upscaling method.\nThe paper is fairly well written and structured, and it seems technically sound.\nExperiments are convincing.\nSome minor issues:\nFigure 2 is not referenced anywhere in the main text.\nFigure 5 is referenced in the main text after figure 6.\nEven if intuitively understandable, all parameters in equations should be explicitly described (e.g., h,w,H,W in eq.1)", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
