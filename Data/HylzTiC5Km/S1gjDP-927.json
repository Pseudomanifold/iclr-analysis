{"title": "Solid paper, excellent execution, very important advance in density modeling", "review": "Summary: \nThis paper addresses an important problem in density estimation which is to scale the generation to high fidelity images. Till now, there have been no good density modeling results on large images when taken into account large datasets like Imagenet (there have been encouraging results like with Glow, but on 5-bit color intensities and simpler datasets like CelebA). This paper is the first to successfully show convincing Imagenet samples with 128x128 resolution for a likelihood density model, which is hard even for a GAN (only one GAN paper (SAGAN) prior to this conference has managed to show unconditional 128x128 Imagenet samples). The ideas in this paper to pick an ordering scheme at subsampled slices uniformly interleaved in the image and condition slice generation in an autoregressive way is very likely to be adopted/adapted to more high fidelity density modeling like videos. Another important idea in this paper is to do depth upscaling, focusing on salient color intensity bits first (first 3 bits per color channel) before generating the remaining bits. The color intensity dependency structure is also neat: The non-salient bits per channel are conditioned on all previously generated color bits (for all spatial locations). Overall, I think this paper is a huge advance in density modeling, deserves an oral presentation and deserves as much credit as BigGAN, probably more, given that it is doing unconditional generation. \n\nDetails:\nMajor:\n-1. Can you point out the total number of parameters in the models? Also would be good to know what hardware accelerators were used. The batch sizes mentioned in the Appendix (2048 for 256x256 Imagenet) are too big and needs TPUs? If TPU pods, which version (how many cores)? If not, I am curious to know how many GPUs were used.\n0. I would really like to know the sampling times. The model still generates the image pixel by pixel. Would be good to have a number for future papers to reference this.\n1. Any reason why 256x256 Imagenet samples are not included in the paper? Given that you did show 256x256 CelebA samples, sampling time can't be an issue for you to not show Imagenet 256x256. So, it would be nice to include them. I don't think any paper so far has shown good 256x256 unconditional samples. So showing this will make the paper even stronger.\n2. Until now I have seen no good 64x64 Imagenet samples from a density model. PixelRNN samples are funky (colorful but no global structure). So I am curious if this model can get that. It may be the case that it doesn't, given that subscale ordering didn't really help on 32x32.  It would be nice to see both 5-bit and 8-bit, and for 8-bit, both the versions: with and without depth upscaling.\n3. I didn't quite understand the architecture in slice encoding (Sec 3.2).  Especially the part about using a residual block convnet to encode the previous slices with padding, and to preserve relative meta-position of the slices. The part I get is that you concatenate the 32x32 slices along the channel dimension, with padded slices. I also get that padding is necessary to have the same channel dimension for any intermediate slice. Not sure if I see the whole point of preserving ordering. Isn't it just normal padding -> space to depth in a structured block-wise fashion? \n4. Can you clarify how you condition the self-attention + Gated PixelCNN block on the previous slice embedding you get out of the above convnet? There are two embeddings passed in if I understand correctly: (1) All previous slices, (2) Tiled meta-position of current slice.  It is not clear to me how the conditioning is done for the transformer pixelcnn on this auxiliary embedding. The way you condition matters a lot for good performance, so it would be helpful for people to replicate your results if you provide all details. \n5. I also don't understand the depth upscaling architecture completely. Could you provide a diagram clarifying how the conditioning is done there given that you have access to all pixels' salient bits now and not just meta-positions prior to this slice? \n6. It is really cool that you don't lose out in bits/dim after depth upscaling that much. If you take Grayscale PixelCNN (pointed out in the anonymous comment), the bits/dim isn't as good as PixelCNN though samples are more structured. There is 0.04 b.p.d  difference in 256x256, but no difference in 128x128. Would be nice to explain this when you add the citation.\n7. The architecture in the Appendix can be improved. It is hard to understand the notations. What are residual channels, attention channels, attention ffn layer, \"parameter attention\", conv channels? \n\nMinor: \nTypo: unpredented --> unprecedented ", "rating": "10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
