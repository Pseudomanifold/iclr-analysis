{"title": "A Borderline Paper: the setting is interesting but the proposed approach is incremental.  ", "review": "The biggest contribution is the setting part, where one seeks to adapt one source to multiple, but somewhat similar, target domains.  It is interesting to explore such direction since in many real-world applications, applying the model to many different target domains are required.   \n\nIt is also noted that there is one very related work \"Multi-target Unsupervised Domain Adaptation without Exactly Shared Categories\" available online (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.00852.pdf).  It is desirable to have a discussion and comparison with them since they are doing Multi-target Unsupervised Domain Adaptation. In their method, the exact shared category is even not required. \n\nFor the algorithm part, authors basically adopt the information-theoretic approach to handle the proposed method. This part contribution is limited since the techniques involved are very common in the domain adaptation. \n\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
