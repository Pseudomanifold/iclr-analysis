{"title": "Intresting work, but the effectiveness of the proposed method is not validated", "review": "The idea of calculating a score to indicate the usefulness of a sample for training deep networks by analyzing the neural activations in semi-supervised learning is interesting.\n\nHowever, the effectiveness of the proposed method is not validated. In the cifar-10 semi-supervised image classification experiment, other semi-supervised learning methods are not compared. In my experiments, simply applying the trained model in the labeled data to obtain pseudo labels on the unlabeled data can obtain significant improvements.\n\nTheoretically, the proposed scoring method uses the pre-trained model to obtain correct activations that has two problems: (1) The evolving power that may be produced by the unlabeled data is constrained. (2) If there are a few numbers of labeled examples, it is very hard to learn a network; thus, the correct activation is not reliable.
