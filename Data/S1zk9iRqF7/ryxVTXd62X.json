{"title": "Need improvement", "review": "[Post revision update] The authors' comments addressed my concerns, especially on the experiment side. I changed the score.\n\nThis paper applies the PATE framework to GAN, and evaluates the quality of the generated data with some predictive tasks. The experimental results on some real datasets show that the proposed algorithm outperforms DPGAN, and the generated synthetic data is quite useful in comparison with real data.\nThe presentation is clear and easy to follow. However, I think the paper needs to be improved in its novelty, and the techniques and experiments need to be more thorough.\n\nMore details:\n- It might be necessary to consider using Gaussian noise[24] in replace of the Laplace noise, which, according to [24], would improve privacy and accuracy.\n- This paper:\n\u201cPrivacy-preserving generative deep neural networks support clinical data sharing\u201d by Brett K. Beaulieu-Jones, Zhiwei Steven Wu, Chris Williams, Casey S. Greene\nseems quite relevant. If so, you may want to add some discussion in the related work section or compare with their result.\n- The last paragraph of the related works section mentioned some related work with shortcomings as working only on low-dimensional data and features of specific types, yet the experiments are also mostly done on low-dimensional datasets. I think it would be better to do a thorough evaluation on data of different kinds, such as image data. \n- If the two evaluation metrics for private GAN is considered an important contribution of the paper, it might be better to make it a separate section and elaborate more on the motivation and method.  \n- It might be better to move some details (for example, instead of presenting the results of the 12 predictive models, presenting only the average, as it\u2019s not very important how each of them performs) of the credit card fraud detection dataset to the appendix and bring the results of the other datasets to the main body. \n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
