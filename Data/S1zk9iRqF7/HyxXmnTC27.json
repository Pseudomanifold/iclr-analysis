{"title": "Interesting setup, surprising that it works", "review": "This paper considers using a GAN to generate synthetic data in a differentially private manner [see also https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/06/05/159756 ]. The key novelty is the integration of the PATE differential privacy framework from recent work. Specifically, rather than a single distinguisher as is usual in a GAN, there is a \"student distinguisher\" and several \"teacher distinguishers\". The student distinguisher is used as usual except that it does not have access to the real data, only the teacher distinguishers have access to the real data (as well as the synthetic data). The data is partitioned amongst the teacher distinguishers and their output is aggregated in a differentially private manner (and gradients are not revealed). The role of the teacher distinguishers is solely to correct the student distinguisher when it errs.\n\nWhat is strange about this setup is that the generator's only feedback is from the gradients of the student distinguisher, which is never exposed to the real data. The entire training process relies on the generator producing realistic data by chance at which point the teacher distinguishers can provide positive feedback. (The paper remarks about this in the middle of page 5.) It's surprising that this works, but there are experimental results to back it up.\n\nI think it would be appropriate to remark that generating private synthetic data is known to be hard in the worst case [ https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2010/017/ ] and therefore it is necessary to use techniques like GANs.\n\nOverall, I think the paper is interesting, well written, novel, and therefore appropriate for ICLR.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
