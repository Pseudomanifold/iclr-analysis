{"title": "Relevant problem, sound solution and convincing experimental evaluation. But limited novelty. Incremental work.", "review": "The paper presents a novel hierarchical clustering method over an embedding space. In the presented approach, both the embedding space and the hierarchical clustering are simultaneously learnt. The hierarchical clustering algorithm aims to recover complex clustering hierarchies which cannot be captured by previously proposed methods. \n\nThe paper address a relevant problem, which is of great interest for extracting knowledge from data. In general, the quality of the paper is high. The presented approach is based on a sound formalization of hierarchical clustering and deep generative models. The paper is easy to follow in spite of the technical difficulty. The experimental evaluation is really extensive. It compares against many state-of-the-art methods. And the results are promising from both a quantitative and qualitative point view. \n\nThe only issue with this paper is its degree of novelty, which is narrow. The proposed method adapt a previously presented hierarchical clustering method in the \"standard space\" (Griffiths et al., 2004) to an embedding space defined by a variational autoencoder model. The inference algorithm builds on standard techniques of deep generative models and, also, on previously proposed methods (Wand and Blei, 2003) for dealing with the complex hierarchical priors involved in this kind of models.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
