{"title": "Trying to learn composition", "review": "This is a good review paper. I am not sure how much it adds to the open question of how to learn representation with high structure. \n\nI would like to see more detail on what is communicated between the controller and the evaluator. Is it a single function selected or a probability distribution that is sent? How does the controller know how many function the evaluator has created? Or visa versa. \n\nThere is a penalty for the complexity of the program, is there a penalty for the number of functions generated? \n\nHaving just read Hudson and Manning's paper using a separate controller and action/answer generator they make strong use of attention. It is not clear if you use attention? Maybe in that you can operate on a portion of X. What role does attention play in your work?", "rating": "9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
