{"title": "Good work with extensive experiments but it seems the novelty is somewhat limited", "review": "This paper proposes to accelerate LSTM by using MF as the post-processing compression strategy. Extensive experiments are conducted to show the performance. However, there are some concerns.\n\n-The novelty of this paper is somewhat limited. The MF methods such as SVD and NMF are directly used in LSTM without any analysis. What are the motivations? Some necessary discussions should be added. There are many MF methods (\"Deep Collaborative Embedding for Social Image Understanding \"). Is another one suitable?\n-The research paper should propose a new idea rather than provide many results to report to readers. The current version seems a good technical report rather than a research paper.\n-There are extensive experimental results. How about the running time? It is better to show some results about the running time. Besides, why not implement the method with GPU, which is widely used in the research community?", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
