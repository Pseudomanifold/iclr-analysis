{"title": "Propose the use of GANs to improve robustness to adversarial instances; extensive results but lack references and positioning to recent relevant arXiv papers", "review": "Summary: The paper proposes a GAN-based approach for dealing with adversarial instances, with the training of a robust discriminator that is able to identify adversaries from clean samples, and a generator that produces adversarial noise for its given input clean image in order to mislead the discriminator. In contrast to the state-of-the-art \u201censemble adversarial training\u201d approach, which relies on several pre-trained neural networks for generating adversarial examples, the authors introduce a way for dynamically generating adversarial examples on-the-fly by using a generator, which they along with their clean counterparts are then consumed for training the discriminator. \n\nQuality: The paper is relatively well-written, although a little sketchy, and its motivations are clear. The authors compare their proposed approach with a good of variety of strong defenses such as \u201censemble adversarial training\u201d and \u201cPGD adversarial training\u201d, supporting with convincing experiments their approach.\n\nOriginality: Xioa et al. (2018) used very similar technique for generating new adversarial examples (generator attack), then used for training a robust discriminator. Likewise, Lee et al. (2018) also used GANs to produce perturbations for making images misclassified. Given this, what is the main novelty of this approach comparing to the (Xioa et al., 2018) and (Lee et al., 2018)? These references should be discussed in details in the paper.\n\nMoreover, limited comparison with different attacks: Why did not compare against targeted attacks such as T-FGS, C&W or GAN-attack?\n\nIt is really surprising that undefended network is working better (showing more robustness) than the defended network \u201cadversarial PGD\u201d on black-box attacks, why this is happening?\n\nReferences:\n- Xiao, C., Li, B., Zhu, J.
