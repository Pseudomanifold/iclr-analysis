{"title": "review report", "review": "This paper introduces an ensemble version of Deep RL by bagging Q-function approximation estimates. In the experiments, the performance of the proposed work is compared to the baseline, single DQN. In spite of the contribution, this paper has a critical issue. \n\nIt has been extensively studied in the literature that ensemble DQN could lead to better performance than a single DQN. See the seminal work by Osband et al. (2016). The authors did not cite this paper, not to say a long list of recent works who have cited this seminal work. This indicates that the authors fail to conduct a serious literature review. In addition, more comprehensive experiments are required to compare the proposed work with the state-of-the-art ensemble DQN methods.\n\nOsband et al. (2016), Deep Exploration via Bootstrapped DQN.
