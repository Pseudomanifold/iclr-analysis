{"title": "Interesting task and dataset.", "review": "The paper introduces a 'code generation as hole completion' task and associated dataset, ExprGen. The authors proposed a novel extension of AST code generation which uses what they call Neural Attribute Grammars. They show the proposed method does well on this task, compared to ablations of their model (which are similar to previous AST approaches).\n\nThe task and dataset are interesting, and the comparison of the proposed method to baselines seems thorough. \n\n*Details to Improve*\nThe authors have a qualitative evaluation section describing the differences in errors made by various methods. Making this more quantitative by categorizing the errors and computing their frequency would be quite interesting.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
