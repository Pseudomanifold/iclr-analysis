{"title": "Adversarial Reprogramming", "review": "This paper extends the idea of 'adversarial attacks' in supervised learning of NNs, to a full repurposing of the solution of a trained net. \n\nThe note of the authors regarding 'Transfer learning' is making sense even to the extend that I fail to see how the proposed study differs from the setting of Transfer learning. The comment of 'parameters' does not make much sense in a semi-parametric approach as studied. The difference might be significant, but I leave it up to the authors to formulate a convincing argument.\n\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
