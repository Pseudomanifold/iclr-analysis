{"title": "A reasonable  paper needing further justifications", "review": "The paper proposed a NN-based model for open set recognition via finding a better feature space where larger inter-class (P2) and smaller intra-class distances (P1) are satisfied. In the proposed model, the inter- and intra-class distances are measured basing on the mean of final linear layer features from each class, and a kind of L2 loss is defined to ensure the properties of the feature space during the training progress. Then the proposed outlier score defined as the minimum inter-class distance becomes the key for the open set recognition task.\n\nGenerally, this paper is well written and easy to read. The proposed threshold estimation method for outlier score based on assumed contamination ratio is reasonable. And three datasets in two domains are used to prove the model\u2019s effectiveness.\n\nMajor comments:\n1.\tThis paper seems less novel.\nThere exist several methods aiming to find a better feature space satisfying the mentioned feature distance properties by adjusting the optimized loss functions, such as Center Loss (Wen et.al 2016) and Additive Angular Margin (Deng et.al 2018). I think the idea Combining ii-loss with Cross Entropy Loss proposed in this paper is quite similar to the Center Loss except that\na)\tthe ii-loss contains a part for maximizing the minimum inter-class distance;\nb)\tthe ii-loss and cross entropy loss are optimized separately.\nSince results shown in Center Loss that without pushing the inter-class distance, the feature space still satisfied P1 and P2, this paper seems not that novel, at least some comparation can be added to analyze the improvement for adding the inter-class part.\n\n2.\tThis paper seems less convincing as well.\nThe paper introduces that the two properties (larger inter-class and smaller intra-class distances) can lead to larger spaces among known classes for the instances of the unknown classes to occupy. However, it keeps uncertain if this can be generalized to unseen classes. In this sense, it is better to conduct some additional theoretical analysis or perform more experiments to validate this. In particular, only one plot was performed to verify this point on one single dataset. Maybe more plots of the distributions can be provided on more additional datasets.\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
