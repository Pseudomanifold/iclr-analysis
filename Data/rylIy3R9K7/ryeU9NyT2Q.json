{"title": "official review of \"Understand the dynamics of GANs via Primal-Dual Optimization\" ", "review": "The paper proposed a primal-dual optimization framework for GANs and multi-task learning. It also analyzes the convergence rate of models. Some results are conducted on both real and synthetic data.\n\nHere are some concerns for the paper:\n\n1. The idea of the model is pretty similar with Xu et al. [2018] (Training Generative Adversarial Networks via Primal-Dual Subgradient Methods: A Lagrangian Perspective on GAN), especially the primal-dual setting. The author totally ignored it. \n\n2. The motivation of the paper is not clear. GANs and multi-task learning are two different perspectives. Which one is your focus and what is the connection between them? \n\n3. The experimental results are not good. The convergence analysis is good. However we also need more empirical evidence to support.
