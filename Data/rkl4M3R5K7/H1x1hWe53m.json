{"title": "Application to multiplicative weight update for constructing adversarial noise", "review": "Summary: \nThe paper considers finding the most adversarial random noise given multiple classifiers. They formulate the problem as the standard min-max game and apply the multiplicative weight updates. The technical contribution is to clarify the computational complexity of implementing/approximating the response oracle. The authors show experimental results.\n\nComments: \nI am afraid that the main technical result is already known:\n\nYoav Freund Robert E. Schapire: Adaptive game playing using multiplicative weights, Games and Economic Behavior, 29:79-103, 1999.\n\nThe paper shows that a multiplicative update algorithm can approximately solve the min-max game. If you use the result, you can readily obtain the main results of the present paper. \n\nAfter rebuttal:\nI read the authors comments and I understood the technical contribution more and raised my score.  Implementing/appriximating the response oracle is non-trivial. For MWU, I still think that the above paper should be cited (citing the Adaboost paper is not enough) since the paper shows MWU solves the min-max game.  \n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
