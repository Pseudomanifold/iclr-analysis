{"title": "review", "review": "This paper introduces a novel feature selection method by utilizing GAN to learn the distributions. The novelty of this paper is to incorporate two recent works, i.e. knockoff for feature selection and W-GAN for generative models. Compared to the latest knockoff work which requires a known multivariate Gaussian distribution for the feature distribution, the proposed work is able to generate knockoffs for any distribution and without any prior knowledge of it.\n\nPros: This paper is very well written. I enjoyed reading this paper. It is novel and addresses an important problem. The numerical study clearly shows the advantage of the proposed work. \n\nCons:\n\nQ1: In the discriminator, instead of training with respect to the full loss, the authors consider to mask some information by using a multivariate Bernoulli random variable $B$ with success probability 0.9. Then the discriminator needs to predict only when $B_i = 0$. Can the authors provide some justification of such choice of the parameters? This choice is a little bit mysterious to me.\n\nQ2: How sensitive are the hyper-parameters $\\eta$ (set to 10 in the experiments), $\\lambda$, and $\\mu$ (set to 1 in the experiments)?\n\nQ3: In the real data example, the feature selection performance is less justified as there is no truth. One suggestion is to evaluate the prediction errors using the selected features and compare with the benchmarks.\n\n\n\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
