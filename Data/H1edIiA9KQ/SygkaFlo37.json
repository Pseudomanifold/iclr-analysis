{"title": "Simple but interesting idea for controling image generation", "review": "The paper proposes a simple but effective method for controlling the location of objects in image generation using generative adversarial networks. Experiments on MNIST and CLEVR are toy examples but illustrate that the model is indeed performing as expected. The experiments on COCO produce results that while containing obvious artefacts are producing output consistent with the input control signal (i.e., bounding boxes). It would however have been interesting to see more varied bounding box locations for the same caption.\n\nIn short, the paper makes an interesting addition to image generation works and likely to be incorporated into future image generation and inpainting methods.", "rating": "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
