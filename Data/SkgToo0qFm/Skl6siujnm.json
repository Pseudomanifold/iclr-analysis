{"title": "Decent application paper and setup for siamese networks", "review": "Summary:\nThis paper uses siamese networks to define a discriminative function for predicting protein-protein interaction interfaces. They show improvements in predictive performance over some other recent deep learning methods. \nThe work is more suitable for a bioinformatics audience though, as the bigger contribution is on the particular application, rather than the model / method itself.\n\nNovelty:\nThe main contribution of this paper is the representation of the protein interaction data in the input layer of the CNN\n\nClarity:\n- The paper is well written, with ample background into the problem.\n\nSignificance:\n- Their method improves over prior deep learning approaches to this problem. However, the results are a bit misleading in their reporting of the std error. They should try different train/test splits and report the performance.\n- This is an interesting application paper and would be of interest to computational biologists and potentially some other members of the ICLR community\n- Protein conformation information is not required by their method\n\nComments:\n- The authors should include citations and motivation for some of their choices (what sequence identity is used, what cut-offs are used etc)\n\n-  The authors should compare to at least some popular previous approaches that use a feature engineering based methodology such as - IntPred\n\n- The authors use a balanced ratio of positive and negative examples. The true distribution of interacting residues is not balanced -- there are several orders of magnitude more non-interacting residues than interacting ones. Can they show performance at various ratios of positive:negative examples? In case there is a consistent improvement over prior methods, then this would be a clear winner\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
