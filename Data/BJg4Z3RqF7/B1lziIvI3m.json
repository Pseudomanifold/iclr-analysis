{"title": "Interesting but confusing", "review": "This paper presents a method to reconstruct images using only noisy measurements. This problem is practically interesting, since the noiseless signal may be unavailable in many applications. The approach combines ideas from recent development in compressed sensing and GANs. However, the model\u2019s presentation is confusing, and many important details of the experiments are missing.\n\nPros:\n\n* The problem is interesting and important\n* The combination of compressed sensing and GANs for image reconstruction is novel\n\nCons:\n\n* The model structure is unclear: for example, what is the role of the variable \\theta? Section 2.1 says it is known, but the algorithm samples from its prior(?). Since there is no further explanation with respect to the experiments, I am not sure how the values of \\theta or its distributions were determined. Although \\theta is formally similar to the \\theta parameters of the measurement function in ambientGANs, this interpretation is at odds with the example given in the paper (below eq.1, saying \\theta can be positions or sizes).\n* A few important details of the model are missing. For example, what is the exact structure of the measurement function F?\n* The baseline models are a bit confusing. More detail about unpaired vs paired supervision would also be helpful for understanding how these baseline models use the additional information.\n* Although the paper mentioned parameters are obtained from cross-validation, it would still be helpful to describe a few important ones (e.g., neural network size, weight \\lambda) for comparison with other models.The experiments on only CelebA dataset are too limited.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
