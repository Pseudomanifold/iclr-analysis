{"title": "A GAN variant for joint discrete-continous latent model", "review": "The paper presents a generative model that can be used for unsupervised and semi-supervised data clustering. unlike most of previous method  the latent  variable is composed of both continuous and discrete variables. Unlike previous methods like ALI the conditional probability  p(y|x) of the labels given the object is represented by a neural network and not simply drown from the data.  The  authors show a  clustering error rate on the MNIST data that is better than previously proposed methods.
