{"title": "the writing should be improved. ", "review": "The paper presents a method for un-/semi- supervised clustering which combines adversarial learning and Mixture of Gaussian. \n\nCons:\nIt is interesting to incorporate the generative model into GAN.\n\nProbs:\n1.\tThe author claims the method is the first one to generative model inferring both continuous and categorical latent variables. I think that such a conclusion is overclaimed, there are a lot of related works, e.g., Variational deep embedding: An unsupervised generative approach to Clustering, IJCAI17; Adversarial Variational Bayes: Unifying Variational Autoencoders and Generative Adversarial Networks, ICML2017. Multi-Modal Generative Adversarial Networks for Diverse Datasets, ICLR19 submission. In fact, these methods are also very competitive approaches to clustering. \n2.\tIs adversarial learning do helpful for clustering with the generative model? Some theoretical should be given, at least, some specified experiments should be designed.  \n3.\tThe novelty should be further summarized by highlighting the difference with most related works including but not limited the aforementioned ones. The current manuscript makes the work seem like a straightforward combination of many existing approaches. \n4.\tIn fact, the paper is hard to follow. I would recommend improving the logic/clarity. \n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
