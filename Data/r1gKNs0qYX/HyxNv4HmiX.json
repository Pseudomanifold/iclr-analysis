{"title": "A new DMM learning scheme is proposed to enhance classification network. The work has acceptable quality and clarity. Some more discussion and comparison to recent classification network is needed. ", "review": "The author proposed a novel classification procedure of discerning, maximum response, and multiple check (DMM) to improve accuracy of mediocre network and enhance feedforward network. The author used a toy model with randomly scattered points around four centres to demonstrate the dynamics of decision boundary construction and show how and why the filter training had worked when a multiclass problem is reduced to a pseudo binary classification. The literature review is rather short, some discussion on how the proposed work advances the latest deep neural networks should be added. The experiments are carried out with a simple CNN, it will be better if the author demonstrate its integration to more state-of-art network and make a comparison to their performance.
