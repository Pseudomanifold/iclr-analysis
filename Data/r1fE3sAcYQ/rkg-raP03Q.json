{"title": "The technique in this paper feels more or less identical to the ideas from Kirkpatrick et al (catastrophic forgetting). The difference seems to be one of application (different tasks vs same task), and as such feels like an incremental advance.", "review": "There is certainly additional novelty in that this paper focuses on models performing same/identical tasks (compared the results from the catastrophic forgetting paper), and because this model more clearly delineates the parameters that are shared across the models, vs those that are not. But both of those advances feel incremental.\n ", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}
