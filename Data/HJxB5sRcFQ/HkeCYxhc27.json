{"title": "Well written paper", "review": "\nThe authors present a GAN based framework for Graphic Layouts. Instead of considering a graphic layout as a collection of pixels, they treat it as a collection of primitive objects like polygons. The objective is to create an alignment of these objects that mimics some real data distribution.\n\nThe novelty is a differentiable wireframe rendering layer allowing the discriminator to judge alignment. They compare this with a relation based discriminator based on the point net architecture by Qi et al. The experimentation is thorough and demonstrates the importance of their model architecture compared to baseline methods. \n\nOverall, this is a well written paper that proposes and solves a novel problem. My only complaint is that the most important use case of their GAN (Document Semantic Layout Generation) is tested on a synthetic dataset. It would have been nice to test it on a real life dataset.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
