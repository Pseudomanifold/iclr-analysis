{"title": "Interesting application of GAN on Layout rendering", "review": "Summary:\nThe paper proposed to use GAN to synthesize graphical layouts. The generator takes a random input and generates class probabilities and geometric parameters based on a self-attention module. The discriminator is based on a differentiable wireframe rendering component (proposed by the paper) to allow back propagation through the rendering module. I found the topic very interesting and the approach seems to make sense.\n\nQuality:\n+ The idea is very interesting and novel.\n\nClarity:\n+ The paper is clearly written and is easy to follow.\n\nOriginality:\n+ I believe the paper is novel. The differentiable wireframe rendering is new and very interesting.\n\nSignificance:\n+ I believe the paper has value to the community.\n- The evaluation of the task seems to be challenging (Inception score may not be appropriate) but since this is probably the first paper to generate layouts, I would not worry too much about the actual accuracy.\n\nQuestion:\nWhy not ask the generator to generate the rendering instead of class probabilities?", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
