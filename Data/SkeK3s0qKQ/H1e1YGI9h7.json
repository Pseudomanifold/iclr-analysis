{"title": "Not enough motivation why crustily driven approach is in interest.", "review": "In this paper, the authors study the problem of exploration in RL when the reward process is sparse. They introduce a new curiosity based approach which considers a state novel if it was not visited before and is far from the visited states. They show that their methods perform better than two other approaches, one without curiosity-driven exploration and the second one a one-step curiosity-driven approach. \n\nThe paper is well-written and easy to follow. The authors motivate this work by bringing an example where the state observation might be novel but important. They show that if part of the environment just changes randomly, then there is no need to explore there as much as vanilla curiosity-driven approaches to suggest. The approach in this paper partially addresses this drawback of curiosity-driven approaches. The authors miss the point why the curiosity-driven exploration approaches as in this work are in interest. \n\nThe problem mentioned in this paper can be also solved based on efficient exploration-exploration methods where the distribution of next states is considered rather than the samples themselves. An efficient explorative/exploitative RL agent explores part of state space more if there is uncertainty in the reward and state distribution rather than not being able to predict a particular sample. In curiosity-driven approaches, if the predictability of the next state is considered, all methods are sentenced to failure in stochastic environments. The approach in this paper partially mitigate this problem but for a very specific environment setup, but still, fails if the environment is stochastic. \n\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
