{"title": "A nice exposition, but without novel results", "review": "In convex optimisation, Su et al. (2014) made a connection between Nesterov\u2019s acceleration and a particular ordinary differential equation (ODE). Subsequently 280+ papers used and extended the technique, including the present paper. The present paper, however, does not cite most of the recent related work; there are only two citations to papers from the past two years. For example, a dozen of papers by Lessard et al:\nhttps://dblp.uni-trier.de/pers/hd/l/Lessard:Laurent\nare not cited at all. Similarly for the work of Recht et al, e.g.:\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02635\nThe work of Scieur et al:\nhttps://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=hNscQzgAAAAJ&hl=fr\nis cited as a single pre-print, while the actual work encompasses two NIPS papers and some pre-prints. Assuming that the authors did not know about the related work is consistent with the fact that the authors reprove (very elegantly!) results of those papers (e.g. Lessard et al and Scieur et al for the acceleration, Recht et  al for the Polyak's method, etc). While I find the subject important, I like the writeup, and find the proofs elegant, I find it hard to justify acceptance.
