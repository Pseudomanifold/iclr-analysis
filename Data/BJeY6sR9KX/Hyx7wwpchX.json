{"title": "Interesting attempt to bridge the gap between ML and neuroscience", "review": "In this interesting study, the authors propose a score (BrainScore) to (1) compare neural representations of an ANN trained on imagenet with primate neural activity in V4 and IT, and (2) test whether ANN and primate make the same mistakes on image classification.  They also create a shallow recurrent neural network (Cornet) that performs well according to their score and also reasonably well on imagenet classification task given its shallow architecture.\n\nThe analyses are rigorous and the idea of such a score as a tool for guiding neuroscientists building models of the visual system is novel and interesting.\n\nMajor drawbacks:\n\n1. Uncertain contribution to ML: it remains unclear whether architectures guided by the brain score will indeed generalize better to other tasks, as the authors suggest.\n\n2. Uncertain contribution to neuroscience: it remains unclear whether finding the ANN resembling the real visual system most among a collection of models will inform us about the inner working of the brain.\n\n\nThe article would also benefit from the following clarifications:\n\n3. Are the recurrent connections helping performance of Cornet on imagenet and/or on BrainScore?\n\n4. Did you find a correlation between the neural predictivity score and behavioral predictivity score across networks tested? If yes, it would be interesting to mention.\n\n5. When comparing neural predictivity score across models, is a model with more neurons artificially advantaged by the simple fact that there is more likely a linear combination of neurons that map to primate neural activations? Is cross-validation enough to control for this potential bias?\n\n6. Fig1: what are the gray dots?\n\n7. \u201cbut it also does not make any assumptions about significant differences in the scores, which would be present in ranking. \u201c\nWhat does this mean?\n\n8. How does Cornet compare to this other recent work: https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.00053 (June 20 2018) ?\n\nConclusion:\nThis study presents an interesting attempt at bridging the gap between machine learning and neuroscience. Although the impact that this score will have in both ML and Neuroscience fields remains uncertain, the work is sufficiently novel and interesting to be published at ICLR. I am fairly confident in my evaluation as I work at the intersection of deep learning and neuroscience.\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
