{"title": "novel, potentially significant & with limitation on large-scale problem", "review": "\nThe paper is really interesting. Set prediction problem has lots of applications in AI applications and the problem has not been conquered by deep networks. \n\nThe paper proposes a formulation to learn the distribution over unobservable permutation variables based on deep networks and uses a MAP  estimator for inference.  It has object detection applications. The results show that it can outperform YOLOv2 and Faster R-CNN in a small pedestrian detection dataset which contains heavy occlusions. \n\nThe limitation is clearly stated in the last part of the paper that the number of possible permutations exponentially grows with the maximum set size (cardinality). \n\nIn the author response period, I would like the author give more details about the pedestrian detection experiments, such as how many dense layers are used after ResNet-101, what are the training and inference time, is it possible to report results on PASCAL VOC (only the person class).\n\nThe method is exciting for object detection funs.  I would like to encourage the authors to release the code and let the whole object detection community overcome the limitation in the paper. \n\n\n\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
