{"title": "The idea proposed in the paper is interesting but the paper appears quite incomplete", "review": "In this paper, the authors propose deep neural networks of infinite width. The primary challenge in such networks is defining a distribution over the weights connecting two layers of infinite width. The authors tackle this by using Gaussian Processes for these distributions with the covariance functions defined in a canonical manner. Inspired by these networks, the authors propose weight initialization schemes for finite width networks.\n\nWhile the idea proposed in the paper is interesting, the paper appears quite incomplete. In particular, the authors do not mention a single example of a kernel that can be constructed using the process outlined in Section 3. Furthermore, the only application of these infinitely wide networks proposed in this paper is for initialization of the weights of finite width networks. It will perhaps be more interesting if the authors can use the kernels obtained for supervised learning tasks using kernel machines (as done in Cho & Saul 2009) or as the covariance function of a Gaussian process (as done in Wilson et al. 2014).\n\nMoreover, the experiments conducted on finite width networks are not enough to justify the utility of this initialization scheme. It will be useful if the authors can test the performance of the state-of-the-art networks for CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet, where the weights of the last fully connected layer have been sampled from different distributions. An extension to initialization for convolutional layers will further strengthen the paper.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
