{"title": "the paper starts with a nice idea, but the development is not clear enough", "review": "This paper starts with a nice and appealing idea --- parametrizing a CNN using just one high-order tensor. The modes of the tensor represent different \"coordinates\" of the weights of CNN. This sounds very reasonable.\n\nThe claimed contributions are also appealing: by doing so, the tensor representation can be used for 1) reducing redundancy and saving memory; 2) accelerating testing; 3) training the CNN from scratch.\n\nThe development of the paper is a bit disappointing since the above contributions were not clearly fleshed out. For example, it is very unclear to the reviewer how the parameterization can be used for training the CNN from scratch. This is a very nice and intriguing  point and should be addressed in detail in the paper. It is a little bizarre that the paper starts with a good introduction, and then introduces some preliminaries of tensors, and then directly goes to experiments. \nMany things claimed in the contributions were not addressed in detail. The reviewer is not sure if these things are considered trivial---but for readers this looks confusing.", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
