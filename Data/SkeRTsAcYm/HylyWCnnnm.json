{"title": "review of \"Phase-Aware Speech Enhancement with Deep Complex U-Net\"", "review": "This paper tackles one of important speech enhancement issues of how to predict phase information. The authors work on this problem based on three novel techniques, one is to use complex U-net, second is to propose a new complex mask representation, which is well bounded and well model complex mask distribution, and the last is an objective function motivated by SDR. The paper is well written, and also shows the experimental effectiveness of the proposed method by analyzing these three novel techniques and also by comparing the method with other speech enhancement methods. My major concern about this paper is that this paper is a little bit too specific to the speech enhancement applications, which will not be accepted with so many researches in the major ICLR community. My suggestion is to describe some potential applications of this method to the other (speech) applications including speech separation, noise-robust front-end for ASR, TTS, or other speech analysis, and also discuss the possibility of extending this method for multichannel input. I\u2019m more interested in the multichannel enhancement because the phase (difference) is critical in this scenario. \n\nComments:\n- Introduction: It\u2019s better to cite and discuss the paper of \u201cE. Hakan et al, \u201cPhase-sensitive and recognition-boosted speech separation using deep recurrent neural networks,\u201d Proc. ICASSP\u201915, pp. 708--712 (2015). This paper is one of the first studies tries to incorporate the phase information to DNN based speech enhancement.\n- Several researchers prefer to use LSTM based enhancement method. Please discuss wether this method (objective function and complex masks) can be applied to complex extensions of LSTMs instead of complex U-net.\n- Page 2, the first paragraph: You may also refer https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.01395\n- Page 3, it\u2019s better to explicitly mention that h = x + i y\n- Section 3.3: discuss how we treat STFT/iSTFT operations under a computational graph representation. It is not so obvious.\n- Section 3.3: again it\u2019s better to mention E. Hakan\u2019s method here.\n- Page 6 footnote: I cannot access to the URL. Please check it.\n- Experiments: I think it would be more interesting to add SDR (using speech and noise as a source) to the experimental measure. Some people use SDR as a speech enhancement measure, and I\u2019m expecting that this method can have more reasonable performance since it is optimized based on wSDR.\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
