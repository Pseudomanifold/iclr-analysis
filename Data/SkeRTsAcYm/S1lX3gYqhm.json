{"title": "generally good paper on speech enhancement using complex operations", "review": "This paper used a complex-valued network to learn the modified complex ratio mask with a weighted SDR loss for the speech enhancement task. It can get good enhancement performance.\n\nFor me, the complex-valued network is already there and weighted SDR loss is not difficult to think. The modified complex ratio mask is a bit interesting. However, I think it better to compare with [Donald S Williamson et al] where the hyperbolic tangent compression is used.\n\nApart from the objective metrics, a human listening test using MOS or preference score should be conducted.\n\nOn Fig 3, the unbounded complex mask might suffer from the infinity problem leading to training failure. However, on table 2, the performance of the unbounded mask is quite close to your method. It is a bit strange for me.\n\nThe total idea is good, but the novelty is not much.\n\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
