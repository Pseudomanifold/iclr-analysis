{"title": "A simple noisy perturbation scheme for improving robustness of CNN", "review": "This paper proposed the pixel redrawing approach to generate distorted training images to improve the performance of the deep networks, which hopefully can be used to prevent future attacks. The key idea is to randomly perturb the pixel values according pre-defined range and probabilities.\n\n\nThe proposed method is quite simple and is similar to denoising autoencoders in flavor.  My concern is that a pre-defined noisy perturbation may not be general enough to tackle various types of attacks. Ideally the perturbation should take into account properties of the input images, both pixel-wise and structure-wise. Unfortunately the proposed method ignores such information. The performance improvement seems quite limited judging from the results.   \n\n\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
