{"title": "Limited technical contribution and evaluation part needs improvement", "review": "This paper applies the idea of dynamic routing between capsules to network embedding application and achieves comparable results as baseline methods. \n\nStrength:\n1)\tIt is interesting to explore how \u2018dynamic routing between capsules\u2019 performs on the task of network embedding.\nWeakness:\n1)\tIt does not seem to be much technical challenge to apply the capsule idea to network embedding. So technical contribution of this paper is limited.\n2)\tThe paper claims by preserving relative positions of nodes, it is able to solve the problem of losing potential information. It could be helpful if the author make it clear why preserving relative positions of nodes is important for network embedding.\n\n3) Evaluation:\na. For the three datasets with node features are of the same type: citation networks. The experimental results could be more convincing if the paper could use other type of attributed networks.\nb. The paper does not mention how the parameters for baseline methods (e.g., LINE, node2vec) are set.\nc. The baseline methods used in Table 3 is a bit too old. The most recent baseline used for the transductive setting was proposed in 2016 (node2vec). Network embedding is a field that grows very rapidly, and many new approaches are proposed in the past two years. The author should consider include more recent methods as baselines in Table 3.\n\nOverall, I think this paper is below the borderline of acceptance, since the technical contribution of this paper is a bit limited, and the evaluation result is relatively weak.\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
