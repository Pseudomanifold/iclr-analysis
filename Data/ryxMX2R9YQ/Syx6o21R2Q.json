{"title": "Novelty is incremental.", "review": "This paper proposes a conditional graph neural network to explore the label correlation. In fact, this method combines graph convolutional neural network and CRF together. The novelty is incremental. No new insight is provided toward this topic. \n\nFor experiments, how did you train DeepWalk (Node2vec)? By using all nodes or the selected training set? It should be clarified in the paper. \n\nAdditionally, Table 3 says the result of semi-supervised methods. But how did you conduct semi-supervised learning for DeepWalk or Node2vec?\n\n===================\nAfter feedback:\nThanks for authors' feedback. Some of my concerns have been addressed. But the novelty is still not significant. On the other hand, the dataset used in this paper is simple. Specifically, at least the first 3 datasets are single-label and the number of classes is not large. They are too simple to support the claim. It's better to use multi-label datasets to show that the proposed method can really capture the correlation of labels. \n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
