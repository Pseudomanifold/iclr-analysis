{"title": "a specific way of using distance to define kernel. not clear what's the benefit", "review": "The paper proposed a new way to define kernel functions using some distance function as random features. The paper also provides some standard analysis of the random feature approach to generalization ability. Overall, the novelty of the paper is low. It is not clear what's the benefit of this approach and it doesn't seems that one can build upon this and lead to new research directions.
