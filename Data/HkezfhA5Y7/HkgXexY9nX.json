{"title": "In my opinion the paper is so poorly written that it makes it difficult for me to judge it", "review": "This paper tries to draw connections between rate distortion theory and DNNs and use some intuitions from that domain to draw conclusions about robustness and generalization of the DNNs. \n\nThe paper is mostly written in a storytelling narrative with very little rigor. In my opinion, this lack of rigor is problematic for a conference paper that has to be concise and rigorous. Moreover, the story is not told in a cohesive way. In most parts of the paper, there is not much relationship between the consecutive paragraphs. And even within most of the paragraphs, I was lost in understanding what the authors meant. I wish the paper would have been self-contained and made concrete definitions and statements instead of very high-level ideas that are difficult to judge. In the current state, it is very difficult for me to say what exactly is the contribution of the paper in terms of the story other than some loosely related high-level ideas. I feel like most parts the story that the authors are telling is already told by many other papers in other forms(papers that authors have cited and many other ones).\n\n\n", "rating": "2: Strong rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
