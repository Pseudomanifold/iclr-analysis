{"title": "Review", "review": "The paper investigates the exploratory conditions under which spatial representations will emerge as a byproduct of learning to predict the next sensory observation. In particular, the authors test three exploratory conditions:\n(i) When the set of sensory-motor interactions (st, mt, s_{t+1}, m_{t+1}) are inconsistent. \n(ii) Environment is static and set of sensory-motor interactions are consistent. \n(iii)  Environment is dynamic and the set of sensory-motor interactions are consistent. \n\nAuthors measure the quality of learned spatial representations by computing disparity between the set of agent positions and the corresponding embedding of motor commands learned by predicting the next sensory observation. They conclude that under condition (iii), the disparity is minimum -- i.e. the agent is best able to discover the spatial structure of it environment. \n\nPhilosophically, I love the direction of this work -- understanding the origins of our spatial representations. But, I am concerned with the delivery. My concerns/questions are as following:\n\n(a) Firstly, the writing is too verbose and vague without clarifying the details and there are too many references to Laflaquiere et al. I would recommend the authors to be more precise, i.e. define topological/metric invariants, clarify how in-consistent sensory/motor pairs are sampled in MTM condition and how environment is perturbed in MMT condition. These things are defined at a high-level and not precisely. \n\n(b) The whole premise of comparing the embedding of motor commands and the agent's spatial configuration only works under a special condition -- s = \u03c6\u03b5(m) (section 3 of the paper), which is not general. For e.g. if an arm is \u201ctorque controlled\u201d it is not possible to predict the location of the arm (i.e. a potential sensory observation) just from the torques. Additional knowledge of the agent\u2019s state such as current position and the velocity of the arm is required. In the examples mentioned in the paper, the arm is \u201cposition\u201d controlled, i.e. given the orientation of each joint (i.e. the motor command) it is possible to predict the sensory observation.  This is a very special case. In biology for example, we control the flexing of muscle fibers using the motor system, we can\u2019t directly output positions of the arm. The general, condition of operation should be: s_{t+1} = \u03c6\u03b5(m_t, s_t). \n\n(c) Authors argue that in order to learn metric invariants, the agent needs to observe the same sensory state under different motor commands. They further argue that in the MMT condition, where the environment also translates, this affect is achieved and therefore metric invariants are learned. My position is that this is simply an artifact of the restricted problem setup where  s = \u03c6\u03b5(m) holds. In a more general setup, s_{t+1} = \u03c6\u03b5(m_t, s_t) there is no requirement for the environment to move. An arm with different torques can be at the same position and hence the condition imposed by authors should be specified naturally even in MM environments. What do the authors think? \n\n(d) Under the condition of,  s = \u03c6\u03b5(m) difference between MM and MMT appears that in one case (MM), neural network is trained without translation perturbations, and in other case MMT is a form of data augmentation with translation perturbations. I am not sure if there is any other justification for why only topological invariants should be learned with MM and metric invariants with MMT. To me it seems like training with data augmentation leads to better metric learning. Do the authors have any other insights \u2014 I would love to know. \n\n(e) Finally the embeddings are useful, if they are useful for an end-task. I would love, if the authors evaluated the learnt embeddings in each of the three conditions for some end tasks such as reaching in case of an arm or something else that is more feasible. \n\nDespite it being a very interesting topic, due to theoretical concerns outlined above, I cannot recommend the paper for acceptance. With a strong rebuttal it is possible to convince me otherwise.  \n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
