{"title": "a novel algorithm on optimization on multiple manifolds", "review": "The paper proposes a novel algorithm for optimization on multiple manifolds. The moving direction fuses gradient information from each manifolds via correlation. More importantly, the convergence is guaranteed.\n\nHowever, the empirical results seems not very good compared to SGD.\n\nMy concerns: \n\n1) How you ensure each step is descent? \n\n2) How is the performance of the proposed algorithm compared to the ADMM which is well-suited for this problem.\n\nThe presentation needs to be improved.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
