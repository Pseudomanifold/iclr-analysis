{"title": "An interesting meta-learning algorithm", "review": "CAML seems an interesting meta-learning algorithm. I like the idea that the context parameters are used to modulate the whole network during the inner loop of meta-learning, while the rest of the network parameters are adaped in the outer loopand shared across tasks. Also, it is good to see that CAML is competitive with on few shot CNNs.\n\nThe paper is very well presented. Experiments are reasonably solid.\n\nIf I understood correctly, although CAML has achieved better accuracy it seems CAML still requires a decent amount of parameter/network structure optimisation. Would be good if the paper has a section talking about practical tricks of how to find the best CAML hyperparameter quickly.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}
