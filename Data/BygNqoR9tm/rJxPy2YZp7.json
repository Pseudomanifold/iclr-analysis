{"title": "summary", "review": "I tried to understand the paper it seems to me that the paper proposed a new objective function for learning an autoencoder based on Sinkhorn algorithm. Following the idea of Sinkhorn algorithm, the Sinkhorn autoencoder minimizes the W-distance between aggregated posterior and the data prior via integrating the objective of (original) autoencoder and Sinkhorn distance. This looks new, but I did not look insight to the detailed derivations. One thing that I do not like is that Sinkhorn distance needs to be optimized before optimizing the autoencoder distance, if I understand correctly.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
