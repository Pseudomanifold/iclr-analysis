{"title": "a good start", "review": "In my opinion this paper is generally of good quality and clarity, modest originality and significance.\n\nStrengths:\n- The experiments are very thorough. Hyperparameters were honestly optimized. The method does show some modest improvements in the experiments provided by the authors.\n- The analysis of the results is quite insightful.\n\nWeaknesses:\n- The experiments are done on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and subsets of CIFAR-100. These were good data sets a few years ago and still are good data sets to test the code and sanity of the idea, but concluding anything strong based on the results obtained with them is not a good idea.\n- The authors claim the formalization of the problem to be one of their contributions. It is difficult for me to accept it. The formalization that the authors proposed is basically the definition of curriculum learning. There is no novelty about this.\n- The proposed method introduces a lot of complexity for very small gains. While these results are scientifically interesting, I don't expect it to be of practical use.\n- The results in Figure 3 are very far from the state of the art. I realize that they were obtained with a simple network, however, showing improvements in this regime is not that convincing.  Even the results with the VGG network are very far from the best available models.\n- I suggest checking the papers citing Bengio et al. (2009) to find lots of closely related papers. \n\nIn summary, it is not a bad paper, but the experimental results are not sufficient to conclude that much. Experiments with ImageNet or some other large data set would be advisable to increase significance of this work.
