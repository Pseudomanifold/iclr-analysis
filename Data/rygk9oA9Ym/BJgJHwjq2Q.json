{"title": "A scene parsing model that takes both objects and their relations into account", "review": "This paper proposed a 3D scene parsing that takes both objects and their relations into account, extending the Factor3D model proposed by Tulsiani et al 18. Results are demonstrated on both synthetic and real datasets.\n\nThe paper is in general well written and clear. The approach is new, the results are good, the experiments are complete. However, I am still lukewarm about the paper and cannot champion it. I feel the paper interesting but not exciting, and it\u2019s unclear what we can really learn from it. \n\nApproach-wise, the idea of using pair-wise relationship as an inductive bias is getting popular. This paper demonstrated that it can be used for scene parsing, too, within a neural net. This is good to know, but not surprising given what have been demonstrated in the extensive literature in the computer graphics and vision community. In particular, the authors should discuss many related papers from Pat Hanrahan\u2019s group and Song-Chun Zhu\u2019s group (see some examples below). Apart from that, this paper doesn\u2019t have an obvious technical innovation that can inspire future work. This is different from Factor3D, which is the first voxel-based semantic scene parsing model from a single color image, with modern neural architecture.\n\nThe results are good, but are on either synthetic data, or using ground truth bounding boxes. Requiring ground truth boxes greatly restricts the usage of these models. Would that be possible to include results under the detection setting on NYU-D or Matterport 3D? The authors claimed that the gain of 6 points is significant; however, a simple interaction net achieves a gain of 5 points, so the technical contribution of the proposed model is not too impressive.\n\nIn general, I\u2019m on the border but leaning slightly toward rejection, because this paper is very similar to Tulsiani et al, and the proposed innovation has been explored in various forms in other papers.\n\nA minor issue:\n-\tIn fig 5. The object colors are not matched for GT and Factor3D and ours.\n\nRelated work\nHolistic 3D Scene Parsing and Reconstruction from a Single RGB Image.
