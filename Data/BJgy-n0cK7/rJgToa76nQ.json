{"title": "The paper presents a feature interpolation strategy that  has limited novelty", "review": "This paper presents a feature interpolation strategy for fast semantic segmentation in videos. They first compute features of keyframes, then interpolate intermediate frames based on block-motion vectors (BMV), and finally fuse the interpolated features as input to the prediction network. The experiments show that the model outperforms one recent, closely related work wrt inference time while preserving accuracy.\n\nPositive:\n1. Efficient inference. The strategy cuts inference time on intermediate frames by 53%, while achieves better accuracy and IOU compared to the one recent closely related work.\n\n2. The ablation study seems sufficient and well-designed. The paper presents two feature propagation strategies and three feature fusion methods. The experiments compare these different settings, and show that interpolation-BMV is indeed a better feature propagation.\n\nNegative:\n\n1. Limited novelty. The algorithm is close to the optical-flow based models Shelhamer et al. (2016) and Zhu et al. (2017). The main difference is that the optical-flow is replaced with BMV, which is a byproduct of modern cameras.  \n\n2. Insufficient experimental comparison with other baselines. In experiments, the paper compares the proposed model with only one baseline Prop-flow, which is not a sufficient comparison to show that the paper really outperforms the state-of-art model. For example, the authors should also compare with \u201cClockwork convnets for video semantic segmentation.\u201d     \n\n3. Some technical details are not clear. For example, in section 3.1, the paper mentions that the task network is built by concatenating three components but never clarifies them. Also, in algorithm 2, line 13 shows that F is a function with two entries, but line 8 indicates that F is a feature.\n\n\n\n\n", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
