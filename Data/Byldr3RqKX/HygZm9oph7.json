{"title": "causality based investigation of the modular structure of the deep generative model", "review": "The work provides a way to investigate the modular structure of the deep generative model. The key concept is the \u201cdistribute over channels of generator architectures\u201d. \nstrong points:\n1) using the causality to investigate the modular of the deep generative model. \n2) the key concept is interesting and straightforward. \n3) the observations in the experiments are interesting. \n\nBut I have the following concerns, \n1) the concept of counterfactual is consistent with that in the causality context? \n2) more details of the causal model of the deep learning are needed,\n3) more details of section 3.1 and 3.2 are needed, especially why these processes are proper interventions?
