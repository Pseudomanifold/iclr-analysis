{"title": "Algorithm description is unclear", "review": "I have to say that this paper is not well organized. It describes the advantage function and CMA-ES, but it does not describe PPO and PPO-CMA very well. I goes through the paper twice, but I couldn't really get how the policy variance is adapted. Though the title of section 4 is \"PPO-CMA\", only the first paragraph is devoted to describe it and the others parts are brief introduction to CMA.\n\nThe problem of variance adaptation is not only for PPO. E.g., (Sehnke et al., Neural Networks 2009) is motivated to address this issue. They end up using directly updating the policy parameter by an algorithm like evolution strategy. In this line, algorithm of (Miyamae et al. NIPS 2010)  is similar to CMA-ES. The authors might want to compare PPO-CMA with these algorithms as baselines.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}
