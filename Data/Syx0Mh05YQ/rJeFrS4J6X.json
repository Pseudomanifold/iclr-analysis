{"title": "A simple and elegant approach to grid cells that begs for theoretical insight", "review": "This paper proposes a simple and elegant approach to learning \"grid-cell like\" representations that uses a high-dimensional encoding of position, together with a matrix for propagating position that involves only local connections among the elements of the vector.  The vectors are also constrained to have their inner products reflect positional similarity.  The paper also shows how such a representation may be used for path planning.\n\nBy stripping away the baggage and assumptions of previous approaches, I feel this paper starts to get at the essence of what drives the formation of grid cells.   It is still steps away from having direct ties to neurobiology, but is trying to get at the minimal components necessary for bringing about a grid cell like solution.  But I feel the paper also stops just a few steps short of developing a fuller theoretical understanding of what is going on.  For example the learned solution is quite Fourier like, and we know that Fourier transforms are good for representing position shift in terms of phase shift.  That would correspond to block size of two (i.e., complex numbers) in terms of this model.  So what's wrong with this solution (in terms of performance) and what is gained by having block size of six, beyond simply looking more grid like?  It would be nice to go beyond phenomenology and look at what the grid-like solution is useful for.\n", "rating": "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
