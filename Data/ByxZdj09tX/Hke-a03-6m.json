{"title": "weak experimental evidence and unconvincing arguments", "review": "The paper presents an approach to infer optimal strategies by learning the payoff function of 2 player games with a neural network Q(s, a), where a are the agent actions and s the context (e.g., action of the other player). The strategy is inferred by considering the inputs as free variables at test time and maximizing the learnt Q over its input variables by backpropagation.\n\nThe structure of the neural network in itself is not particularly original. The originality of the paper is to show that experimentally, in some 2-player games (and small sequential games, using an RNN), the policy that is inferred is close to a Nash equilibrium. While this is an interesting result in itself, the games used in the experiment are pretty easy to solve with existing algorithms, so the experimental evidence that this approach can work in practice in difficult cases is weak.\n\nThe motivation and intuition fail to be convincing. There is an excessive usage of analogies with intelligence and life in general that are not particularly enlighting (e.g., \"Even though its hardware is damaged, the software in\nthe cloud (or the eternal soul, arguably) of the mosquito [...]\", the value of the analogy between the cloud and the soul is unclear), and in the end there is no clear explanation of why it should work in practice. \n\nI think the paper in its current form is not ready for publication. More formal arguments and/or stronger experimental evidence are necessary.\n ", "rating": "2: Strong rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
