{"title": "has grand ideas but poorly written, cannot check for correctness", "review": "The paper is extremely difficult to read. There are too many concepts introduced at once, casual comments mixed with semi-formal statements. The theorems sound interesting, the implications are grand and of interest to ICLR, but the proofs are impossible to follow. As such, I am not in a position to make a recommendation. \n\nI strongly recommend the authors to split the paper into multiple parts with clear-cut statements in each, with clear and detailed proofs, and submit to appropriate journals / conferences. \n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess"}
