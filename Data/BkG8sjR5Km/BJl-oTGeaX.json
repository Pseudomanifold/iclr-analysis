{"title": "Well-written submission with good analysis", "review": "The paper proposes a new environment - 2vs2 soccer - to study emergence of multi-agent coordinated team behaviors. Learning relies on population-based training of agent's shaped reward mixtures and approach of nash averaging is used for evaluation.\n\nClarity: the paper is well-written and clear. The ablations provided are helpful in understanding how much different introduced components matter, and quantitative and qualitative analysis of resulting behavior is quite nice\n\nOriginality: the individual pieces of this work (PBT, SVG, nash averaging) have been introduced previously, but this paper puts them together in a well-chosen manner.\n\nSignificance: I believe this paper proposes a number of interesting observations (effects of PBT, evaluation, effects of recurrent policies to overcome non-stationarity issues) that I believe would be of value to the part of ICLR community doing research in multi-agent systems. ", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
