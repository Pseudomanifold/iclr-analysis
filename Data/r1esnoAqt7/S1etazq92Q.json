{"title": "not enough contribution", "review": "The author proposed an extended version of MNIS where they introduced thickening/thinning/swelling/fracture. The operation is done using binary morphological operations.\n\n* Providing benchmark data for tasks such disentanglement is important but I am not sure generating data is sufficient contribution for a paper. \n* I am not sure what conclusion I should draw from Fig 5 and Fig 6 about the data.\n* Eventually this data can become a benchmark data when it is paired with a method. Then that method/data are a benchmark.\n\n ", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
