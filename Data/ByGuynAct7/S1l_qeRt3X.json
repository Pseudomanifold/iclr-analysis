{"title": "Not a strong paper", "review": "This paper considers modeling convolutional neural network by a Bayes method. The prior for the weights is considered in which the weights from various layers, input and output channels are assumed to be independent.  A varational method is considered to approximate the posterior distribution of the weights of CNN.  It looks to me that the prior distribution is a fairly standard product which may not perfectly suitable for CNN. Also the validity of the proposed variational method needs further evaluation. Below I summarize my concerns more technically.\n\n1. CNN essentially has a tree structure, i.e., each layer can be viewed as the parent of the next layer. So the consecutive layers should have a sort of dependence. Also, the weights based on the same input channel should all inherit features of that channel. Based on these considerations, is it really reasonable to assume that the random weights are independent?\nI agree that independence assumption makes the model and computation easier, but the prior itself should reflect the possible dependence structure of the channels.\n\n2. The KL divergence might not be tractable and so the proposed variational method replaces it with an upper bound. This method highly depends on the assumption that the upper bound of the KL divergence is accurate. Otherwise it is hard to tell that the method really approximates the authentic variational method very well. It would be great if the accuracy of the upper bound can be further evaluated (theoretically and numerically).\n\n\n\n\n\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
