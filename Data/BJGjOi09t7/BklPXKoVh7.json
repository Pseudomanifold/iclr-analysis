{"title": "lacking motivation and comparisons", "review": "The paper is generally well-written (lacking details in some sections though). My main criticism is about the lack of motivation for nonnegative VAE and lack of comparison with NMF.\n\nComments:\n- the motivation of the proposed methodology is not clear to me. What is the interest of the proposed auto-encoding strategy w.r.t NMF ? There is no experimental comparison either. Besides the probabilistic embedding (which exists in NMF as well), is there something PAE-NMF can do better than NMF ? There is probably something, but the paper does not bring a convincing answer.\n- the paper missed important references to nonnegative auto-encoders, in particular:\nhttps://paris.cs.illinois.edu/pubs/paris-icassp2017.pdf\n- the review of probabilistic NMF works is limited, see e.g.,\nhttps://paris.cs.illinois.edu/pubs/smaragdis-spm2014.pdf\n- more details are needed about inference in Section 2.4\n\nMinor comments:\n- the notations z and h are sometimes confusing, what about using h every where ?\n- it\u2019s not clear to me how the first term in (1) is equal to the second term in (2", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
