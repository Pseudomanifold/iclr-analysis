{"title": "A quite preliminary study", "review": "In this paper, the authors propose Recurrent Distribution Regression Network (RDRN), which uses a recurrent architecture upon a previous model Distribution Regression Network (DRN). The authors explain the technical details of the model, but fail to describe any motivation of their model as well as the key assumptions in the model. The missing part, to me, is the most important part of this paper in terms of technical contribution. Overall, some description of the technical detail is not accurate, for example, the authors used \"the density of the pdf\", which should be either \"the density of the distribution\" or \"the probability density function\".\nAnother place \"each node in the network encodes an entire probability distribution\", it is unclear to me what is an \"entire probability distribution\". Do you mean conditional distribution or marginal distribution? Does this model captures joint distribution? In addition, the paper seems to be quite preliminary with a number of typos and grammar errors. For example, \"Forward propagation is performed layer-wise obtain the output prediction.\"\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
