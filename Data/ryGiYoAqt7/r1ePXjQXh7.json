{"title": "Limited novelty", "review": "The paper proposes PDDPG, a combination of prioritized experience replay, parameter noise exploration, and DDPG. Different combinations are then evaluated on MuJoCo domains, and the results are mixed. \n\nThe novelty of the work is limited, and the results are hard to interpret: sometimes PDDPG performs better, sometimes worse, and the training curves are only obtained with a single random seed. Also presented results are substantially worse than current state of the art (e.g., TD3, SAC).\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
