{"title": "This is a theoretical paper investigating learning a one-hidden-layer CNN with overlap ", "review": "I believe the authors need to give more intuition on the importance of such a study, and how it can lead to improvement in real life application.\nThe work seems interesting but is limited and as the authors mentioned it might be a good start for further investigation. However, what I really wanted to see was a simple comparison on a dataset like MNIST with conventional CNN being trained via SGD, for example.\nAlso, there are some small typos you may need to fix, e.g \"will be play\" -> \"will be playing\".", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess"}
