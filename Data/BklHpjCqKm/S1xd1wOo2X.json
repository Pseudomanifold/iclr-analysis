{"title": "Promising, simple approach to model learning. Some questions regarding generalizability to systems with complex dynamics.", "review": "I like the simplicity of the approach in this paper (especially compared to very computationally hungry methods such as Deepmind's \"Graph Networks as Learnable Physics Engines for Inference and Control\"). The fact that the approach allows for online learning is also interesting. I very much appreciate that you tested your approach on a real robot arm!\n\nI have a number of questions, which I believe could help strengthen this paper:\n- The decomposition of H into L^TL ensures H is positive definite, however there are no constraints on g (gravity/external forces). How do you ensure the model doesn't degenerate into only using g and ignoring H? In the current formulation g only depends on q, however this seems insufficient to model velocity dependent external forces (e.g. contact dynamics). Please elaborate.\n- How would you handle partial observability of states? Have you tried this? \n- How would you extend this approach to soft robots or robots for which the dimensionality of the state space is unknown?\n- Have you tested your method on systems that are not kinematic chains? How would complex contact dynamics be handled (e.g. legged robots)?\n- It would be interesting to see more comparisons with recent work (e.g. Deepmind's).\n\nSome figures (e.g. Figure 6) are missing units on the axes. Please fix.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
