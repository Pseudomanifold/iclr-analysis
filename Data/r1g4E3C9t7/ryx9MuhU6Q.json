{"title": "Interesting findings but hard to fully understand the experiments.", "review": "This paper proposed a study on audio adversarial examples and conclude the input transformation-based defenses do not work very well on the audio domain, especially for adaptive attacks. They also point out the importance of temporal dependency in designing defenses which is specific for the audio domain. This observation is very interesting and inspiring as temporal dependency is an important character that should be paid attention to in the field of audio adversarial examples. They also design some adaptive attacks to the defense based on temporal dependency but either fail to attack the system or can be detected by the defense.\n\nBased on the results in Table S7, it seems like being aware of the parameter k when designing attacks are very helpful for reducing the AUC score. My question is if the attacker uses the random sample K_A to generate the adversarial examples, then how the performance would be. Another limitation of this work is that the proposed defense can differentiate the adversarial examples to some extent, but the ASR is not able to make a right prediction for adversarial examples. In addition, the writing of Section 4 is not very clear and easy to follow.\n\nIn all, this paper proposed some interesting findings and point out a very important direction for audio adversarial examples. If the author can improve the writing in experiments and answer the above questions, I would support for the acceptance.\n\n\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
