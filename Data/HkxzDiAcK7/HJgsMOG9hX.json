{"title": "An interesting application of CNN for classification on audio dataset. ", "review": "The paper applied convolution neural network for type/position classification tasks on an interesting audio dataset which recorded the impact noises of a building. Details description of the dataset is provided and experiment results with VGG16 are presented. All in all, while the application scenario is interesting, the novelty of the paper is rather mild. Using pretrain VGG for audio classification has already been proposed by several other papers.  Moreover, this paper may receive a much broader audience in acoustic journal/conference than in ICLR.\n\nSeveral improvements can be done for the papers. Firstly, an embedding layer or a transformation layer can be built for transforming the audio signals into \u201cimages\u201d. It would be interesting to compare this type of structure versus directly using log-scaled Mel-spectrogram. Second, instead of using images to pre-train VGG network. How about using acoustic signals. What can be the gain or loss of the performance?  Third, more detail information about the adaptation layer can be provided. Fourth, about the metric used for position prediction, it would be nice to have a weighted accuracy with the consideration of position. \n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
