{"title": "A interesting study of how to optimize kernel change-point detection algorithm. ", "review": "A new approach to choose a kernel to maximize the test power, for the kernel change-point detection. This provides an extension to the two-sample version of the problem (Gretton et al. 2012b, Sutherland et al. 2017). The difficulty is caused by that there is very limited samples from the abnormal distribution. The idea is based on choosing a surrogate distributions using generative model. The idea makes sense although there seems to be not much detail in how to choose the surrogate distribution. There is a mechanism to study the threshold. Real-data and simulation demonstrates the good performance. I think the idea is really interesting and I am impressed by the completeness of the work.
