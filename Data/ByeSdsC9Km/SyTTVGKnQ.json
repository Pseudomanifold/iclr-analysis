{"title": "Review for adaptive posterior learning", "review": "The paper proposes a novel model that reads in information, decide whether this information is surprising and hence whether or not to keep it in memory and also utilizing information in the memory to quickly adapt or reason. The authors experimented with few-shot Omniglot classification and meta learning reasoning tasks. \n\nNovelty:\n\nThe authors introduced a novel self-contained model that decides what to write to the external memory and making use of the external memory for different tasks.\n\nMy comments are mostly as follows: \n\n1. The paper is well written, the problems are clearly stated, the solution is presented in a clear way, overall very easy to follow.\n\n2. This is an interesting paper that combines a novel technique for writing to external memory based on surprisal and using it for more difficult tasks such as deductive reasoning.  I really like the surprisal mechanism, there are cognitive/ neuroscience materials that supports this approach (that the brain tends to write to memory things that are surprising). This also makes total sense from a machine learning perspective. \n\n3. Could another objective  be used for surprisal? Also, instead of a determinstic encoder, decoder, is it possible to use a variational objective?\n\n4. The experiments look convincing.\n\nOverall a very nice paper, nice idea, could show more resul", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
