{"title": "Interesting extensions for multi-agent communication, it misses some baselines to illustrate the benefits of the contribution.", "review": "The authors present a multi-agent communication architecture where, agents can use targeted communication and can perform multiple communication steps. The paper is well written and easy to follow.\n\nComments:\n\n1) The idea of multi-stage communication is great, but the paper doesn't have a strong point to support this contribution. Could the authors illustrate the benefit of multi-stage e.g. vs. the communication channel width?\n\n2) In DIAL, the authors introduce a \"null\" action, what is the difference of that and multi-stage?\n\n3) It is not clear to the reader what is the contribution of targeted communication vs. non-targeted as it looks a solution to the mean-pooling. Could the authors include at least one more experiment with on an architecture that doesn't use mean pooling. From an architecture perspective there is a scalability benefit of using pooling, but if that's the only one it has to be made more clear.\n\n4) Following (3) based on Reddit there was a recent code release in python https://github.com/minqi/learning-to-communicate-pytorch. An alternative would be to evaluate TarMAC to one of the test beds, but the paper misses baselines.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
