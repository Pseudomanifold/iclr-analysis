{"title": "Interesting results supported by experiments", "review": "The paper introduces Generative Feature Matching Networks (GFMNs) which is a non-adversarial approach to train generative models based on feature matching. GFMN uses pretrained neural networks such as Autoencoders (AE) and Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) to extract features. Equation (1) is the proposed loss function for the generator network. In order to avoid big mini-batches, the GFMN performs feature matching with ADAM moving average.The paper validates its proposed approach with several experiments applied on benchmark datasets such as CIFAR10 and ImageNet.\n\nThe paper is well-written and straight-forward to follow. The problem is well-motivated by fully discussing the literature and the proposed method is clearly introduced. The method is then validated using several different experiments.\n\nTypos:\n** Page 1 -- Paragraph 3 -- Line 8: \"(2) mode collapsing in not an issue\"", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
