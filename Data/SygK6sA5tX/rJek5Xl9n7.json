{"title": "Interesting construction but limited novelty", "review": "The authors propose an advance in geometric deep learning based on a geometric scattering transform using graph wavelets defined in terms of ran- dom walks on the graph. The paper is well written, easy to understand also for a not-so-tech audience but nevertheless precise in all the mathematical details.\nIntro and references are satisfactory, and also the experimental section is sufficiently convincing. However, there are two big issues undermining the overall structure of the manuscript: \na) the theoretical novelty w.r.t. (Zou & Lerman, 2018) and (Game, 2018) is partial and rather technical, so the originality of the present manuscript is limited\nb) the improvement w.r.t. to other published method is rather small, so the performance gain is only partially justified by the quite complex theoretical construction.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
