{"title": "Missing any theoretical justification, but encouraging empirical result", "review": "The paper introduces a two-step adversarial defense method, to generate two adversarial examples per clean sample and include them in the actual training loop to achieve robustness. The main claim is that the proposed two-step scheme can outperform more expensive iterative methods such as IFGSM; hence achieving robustness with lower computation. The first example is generated in a standard way (FGSM) method, while the second example is chosen to maximally increase the cross entropy between output distribution of the first and second adversarial example.\n\nThe idea seems simple and practical and the empirical results are encouraging. However, other than experiments, there is no justification why the proposed loss should do better that IFGSM. Ideally, I wanted to see the authors to start from some ideal defense definition (e.,g. Eq 4) and then show that some kind of approximation to that leads to the proposed scheme. In the absence of that, the faith about the proposed method solely must be based on the reported empirical evaluation, which is not ideal due to issues like hyper parameter tuning for each of the methods. I hope at least the authors publish the code so it could tried by others.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
