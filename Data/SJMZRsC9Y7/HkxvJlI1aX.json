{"title": "Insufficient contents and experiments.

The author didn't quite explain how the proposed method, such as why using non-extensive statistic in this context,\n\nThe experiment results aren't convincing and lack sufficient information for reproducibility.", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
