{"title": "Extension to case of sets with different sample sizes?", "review": "The paper is understandable and the question addressed is interesting. The use of log likelihoods to metrize distances between sets, although not new, is used quite effectively to address the issue of label switching in sets. Although the run time is O(N^2), the metric can be computed in a parallelized manner. The question of comparing sets of different sample sizes would be a valuable extension to the work. Although I think the proposed loss function addresses some important issues, would like to defer the question of acceptance/rejection to other reviewers due to lack of expertise in related areas.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
