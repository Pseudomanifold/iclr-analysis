{"title": "Review", "review": "This paper proposes a List Conditional Variational Autoencoder approach for the slate recommendation problem. Particularly, it learns the joint document distribution on the slate conditioned on user responses, and directly generates full slates. The experiments show that the proposed method surpasses greedy ranking approaches.\n\nPros:\n+ nice motivation, and the connection with industrial recommendation systems where candidate nomination and ranker is being used is engaging\n+ it provides a conditional generative modeling framework for slate recommendation\n+ the simulation experiments very clearly show that the expected number of clicks as obtained by the proposed List-CVAE is much higher compared to the chosen baselines. A similar story is shown for the YOOCHOOSE challenge dataset.\n\nCons: \n- Do the experiments explicitly compare with the nomination & ranking industry standard?\n- Comparison with other slate recommendation approaches besides the greedy baselines?\n- Comparison with non-slate recommendation models of Figure 1?\n\nOverall, this is a very nicely written paper, and the experiments both in the simulated and real dataset shows the promise of the proposed approach.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
