{"title": "Interesting idea but badly written text and not enough experiments", "review": "The authors consider anomaly detection problem.\nThey claimed that typical methods do not perform well on multi-modal distributions.\nThe authors trained GAN to generate samples in low-density regions of the original probability density. Since a discriminator is trained to classify such samples from real data, mainly belonging to high-density regions of the original probability density, then the discriminator can be used to detect anomalies.\n\nComments\n1) the authors wrote that they develop a multi-modal one-class generative adversarial network based detector to distinguish anomalies from normal data (products). Which products?\nDid the authors develop their approach specifically only for some very particular engineering problem (from Samsung)? If so, then the better place for such papers is some industrial journal/conference. If not, then the authors should provide comparisons using other datasets than  Samsung data\n2) the paper contains enormous number of\n- misprints, e.g. \u201cmeets all standards and requirements, fraud detection citepzheng2018one where it discriminate a \u201c (page 1, section 1)\n- mistakes in the text, bad wording, e.g. \"Experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art one-class classification models and other anomaly detection methods on both normal data and anomalies accuracy, as well as the F1 score\" (page 1, abstract)\n- mistakes in formulas, e.g. problems with subscripts in (7), problems with expectation sign in (9), etc.\nas a result, readability of the paper is very low. From the general explanation of the idea of the proposed algorithm in section 1 it is not possible to understand how it works\n3) the general idea (train GAN to generate samples in low-density regions of the original probability density; since a disrciminator is trained to classify such samples from real data, mainly belongning to high-density regions of the original probability density, then the discriminator can be used to detect anomalies) is nice. However, partially due to very bad text, partially due to errors in formulas it is not possible to understand technical description of the algorithm, e.g.\n- why do we need H()?\n- how do we model Q(c|x)?\n- how do we model p(c|x)?\n- how constants tau and C are selected?\n- etc\n4) Experimental section is not sufficient. The authors considered only one dataset which is proprietary\n5) The authors claimed that they do not need to tune the threshold to detect anomalies from other observations. But is this actually true? In fact, for the discriminator, which is used to detect anomalies, we still need to select some threshold expressing our confidence in whether the considered observation is anomalous or not\n\nConclusion\n- the idea is interesting\n- the paper is not OK for very high standards of ICLR\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
