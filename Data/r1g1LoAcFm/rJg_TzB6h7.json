{"title": "Multi-label using ontology", "review": "This paper proposes a neural network, the outputs of which create a \"Bayesian network of sigmoids\". This is for use in massively multi-label situations where the class outputs are connected to some ontology. By using the ontology, the performance on long-tail classes with few examples should be improved.\nI like the method. It is intuitive and easy to implement. The only issue I have with the features and model is when in 3.1.2 the weights for the medical labels as input to the encoder are said to be 'tied' to the output label embeddings. I would like to have seem more justification for this (perhaps just the keeping number of parameters down?) or evaluation as to whether it helped - I think it may have hindered because of how the output label is used in the dot product.\nThe stated difference between this work and previous hierarchical softmax models is that they use DAG structures, not just tree structures. However, of the two datasets they try, only one (proteins) has a DAG structure to the ontology, and they do not have a baseline comparison with a hierarchical softmax model.\nThe method does show improvements at low number of examples against a flat sigmoid model in the small disease prediction and protein function prediction, but other results are mixed, especially for the proteins with the DAG ontology, which is where one would have liked to see an advantage.\nI would like to have seen performance against a hierarchical soft max framework, or on some openly available or benchmark datasets, otherwise it is hard to judge the utility of the method.\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
