{"title": "Using label structure to address class imbalance", "review": "This is a clear and well written paper that attempts to improve our ability to predict in the setting of massive multi-label data which, as the authors highlight, is an increasingly import problem in biology and healthcare. \n\nStrengths:\nThe idea of using the hierarchical structure of the labels is innovative and well-motivated. The experimental design and description of the methods is excellent. \n\nWeaknesses:\nOverall the results are not consistently strong and there is a key baseline missing. The approach only seems help in the \"rare label, small data\" regime, which limits the applicability of the method but is still worthy of consideration. \n\nMy biggest reservation is that the authors did not include a baseline where the classes are reweighted according to their frequency. Multilabel binary cross-entropy is very easy to modify to incorporate class weights (e.g. upweight the minority class for each label) and without this baseline I am unable to discern how well the method works relative to this simple baseline.\n\nOne more dataset would also strengthen the results, and since I am suggesting more work I will also try to be helpful and be specific. Predicting mesh terms from abstracts would qualify as a massive multilabel task and there is plenty of public data available here: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/databases/download/pubmed_medline.html \n\nFinally, there is one relevant paper that the authors may wish to consider in their review section: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/07/10/365965", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
