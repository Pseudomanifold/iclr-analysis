{"title": "Impressive experiments, but hard to determine how much is methodologically new here", "review": "The paper proposes \"style transfer\" approaches for text rewriting that allow for controllable attributes. For example, given one piece of text (and the conditional attributes associated with the user who generated it, such as their age and gender), these attributes can be changed so as to generate equivalent text in a different style.\n\nThis is an interesting application, and somewhat different from \"style transfer\" approaches that I've seen elsewhere. That being said I'm not particularly expert in the use of such techniques for text data.\n\nThe architectural details provided in the paper are quite thin. Other than the starting point, which as I understand adapts machine translation techniques based on denoising autoencoders, the modifications used to apply the technique to the specific datasets used here were hard to follow: basically just a few sentences described at a high level. Maybe to somebody more familiar with these techniques will understand these modifications fully, but to me it was hard to follow whether something methodologically significant had been added to the model, or whether the technique was just a few straightforward modifications to an existing method to adapt it to the task. I'll defer to others for comments on this aspect.\n\nOther than that the example results shown are quite compelling (both qualitatively and quantitatively), and the experiments are fairly detailed.\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
