{"title": "Using GAN for data augmentation is not new and there lacks theoretical insights.", "review": "Authors propose to apply GAN to generate the adversarial examples efficiently when training the robust model. \nMajor issue:\n1.\tUsing GAN as the generator for sampling adversarial examples is popular these years. This work simply applies it for the data augmentation where the novelty is limited.\n2.\tThere are many strategies for data augmentation as adversarial training, and authors should include some in comparison, e.g., \nICLR\u201918: Certifying Some Distributional Robustness with Principled Adversarial Training\n3.\tThe experiments seem not convincing. The performance on CIFAR-10 without attacks is much worse than the-state-of-the-art. Authors claim the proposed strategy is efficient, but they didn\u2019t provide the results on the imagenet-1k data set.\nMinor issue:\nThe first three subfigures in Fig. 4 is not clear.\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
