{"title": "Nice paper that combines RL and constraints expressed by logical formulas", "review": "The contribution of the paper is to set up an automaton from scTLTL formulas, then corresponding MDP that satisfies the formulas is obtained by augmenting the state space with the automaton state and zeroing out transitions that do not satisfy the formula. This approach seems really useful for establishing safety properties or ensuring that constraints are satisfied, and it is a really nice algorithmic framework. The RL algorithm for solving the problem is entropy-regularized MDPs. The approach \u201cstitches\u201d policies using AND and OR operators, obtaining the overall optimal policy over the aggregate. Proofs just follow definitions, so they are straightforward, but I think this is a quality. The approach is quite appealing because it provides composition automatically. The paper is very well written.  The main problem I see with the work is that composition can explode the number of states in the new automaton and hence the new MDP. It would be interesting in future work to do \u201csoft\u201d ruling out of transitions rather than the \"hard\" approach used in the paper. The manipulation task provided is quite appealing, as the robot arm is of high dimensionality but the FSAs obtainedare discrete. Overall, the paper provides a very good contribution.\n\nSmall comments:\nEquation equation in Def 3 also proof of Theorem 2\nIn section,  -> In this section\nare it has -> and it has", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
