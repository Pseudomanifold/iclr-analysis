{"title": "A ok paper but not good enough", "review": "This paper introduces a hierarchical deep learning model that combines CNN and LSTM through a two agents process. The details of this framework, specially how CNN and LSTM are being trained and used in the process, is not clear (Figure 1 is not also very clear). Even though the experiments support the claim for some interpretability (for example that different levels of classification are reasonable), I am not sure if this level of interpretability is what we desire when we talk about interpretability. There is still little known about how the model does the classification in terms of mapping an input image to a label and we still know little about what is happening through different layers of the deep neural network. In summary, even though the paper could have some qualifications, the details of the framework is not clear and  I am not convinced that it addresses the problem it aims to solve, i.e. interpretability!
