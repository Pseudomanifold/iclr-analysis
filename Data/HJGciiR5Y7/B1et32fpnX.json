{"title": "Latent Convolutional Models", "review": "This paper proposes to increase the latent space dimensionality  of images, by stacking the latent representation vectors as a tensor. Then convolutional decoder and encoder networks are used to map the original data to latent space and vice versa. The learned latent representations can then be used in a universal framework for multiple tasks such as image inpainting, superresolution and colorization.\n\nThe idea of increasing the dimensionality of the latent space, although not sophisticated, seems to be performing very good. Indeed in some of qualitative experiments, the results are surprising. The authors should clarify that how is the training procedure performed in more details. Are test images included in the training the convolutional networks?", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
