{"title": "Replacing dynamic routing with trainable layers is interesting, but the contributions of the paper are not very clear.", "review": "This paper proposes to replace the dynamic routing layer of the original capsule networks with a trainable neural network layer. The idea is interesting. However, the following problems concern me.\n\nThe model is named as \u201cgeneralized capsule networks\u201d but it is not very clear what \u201cgeneralized\u201d means here. Does making the dynamic routing layer trainable generalize capsule?\n\nThe contributions of the paper will be clearer if further comparison is provided. The model is proposed based on capsule nets but it lacks comparison between the proposed model and the original capsule nets. For example, the experiments did not include the original CapsNet models (Sabour et al., 2017 or Hinton et al., 2018), which, if performed, would help understand the differences/advantages of the proposed models.\n\nThe major modification made on capsule nets is on the dynamic routing layer. In order to incorporate routing into the whole trainable process, this paper incorporate the coefficients c_{ij} to the model parameters. It is not clear if the proposed model constrains c_{ij} are further constrained, e.g., (as in the original capsule nets) to sum up to 1 along the dimension i?  \n\nIn general, the paper is well structured and easy to follow. \n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
