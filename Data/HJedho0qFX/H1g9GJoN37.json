{"title": "Limited contribution. In addition, it's hard to identify the contribution of this paper.", "review": "This paper extends the previous work (Dharmaretnam & Fyshe, 2018), which provided a analytic tool for understanding CNNs through word embeddings of class labels. By analyzing correlations between each CNN layers and class labels, enables to investigates how each layer of CNNs work, how much it performed well, or how to improve the performance.\n\nI felt it is little hard to read this paper. Although the short summary of contributions of this paper in the Introduction, I could not easily distinguish contributions of this paper from the ones of the previous work. It's better to explicitly explain which part is the contributions of this paper in detail. For example, \"additional explorations of the behavior of the hidden layers during training\" is not clear to me because this expression only explain what this paper do briefly, not what this paper is actually different from the previous work, and how this difference is important and crucial.\n\nSimilarly, I could not understand why adding concepts, architectures (FractalNet), datasets (CIFAR-100) is so important. Although this paper states these changes are one of the contributions, it is unclear whether these changes lead to significant insights and findings which the previous work could not find, and whether these findings are so important as contributions of this paper. Again, I think it is better to describe what main contributions of this paper are in more detail.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}
