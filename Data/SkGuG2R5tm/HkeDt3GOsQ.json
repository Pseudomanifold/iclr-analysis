{"title": "Problematic  experimental results", "review": "The idea, transforming the input data to an output space in which the data is distributed uniformly and thus indexing is easier, is interesting. \n\nMy main concerns come from experimental results.\n\n(1) Table 1: where are the results of OPQ and LSQ from? run the codes by the authors of this paper? or from the original paper?\n\nIt is not consistent to the LSQ paper (https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~julm/papers/eccv16.pdf). For BigANN1M, from the LSQ paper, the result is >29 recall at 1 for 64 bits. \n\n(2) Figure 5: similarly, how did you get the results of PQ and OPQ?\n\n(3) There are some other advanced algorithms: e.g.,  additive quantization (Babenko & Lempitsky, 2014) and composite quantization (https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.00955)\n\nThe above points make it hard to judge this paper.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
