Data augmentation for DNN includes different perspective, including nonlinearity, adversarial etc. Generalization of  spatial and appearance models is not enough. The model formulate from a simple classification setting but does not involve too many for DNN models.  I put more references below. \n\n2. The experimental results are not strong. Not all strong baselines are included (I put some in the references). The improvements are marginal. Besides, I need more experimental setting information.\n\n3. The writing is not clear. For the related work part, it included many paragraph which are not related to the work, (e.g. GANs). In the introduction part, it did not mention the generalization of both spatial and appearance models, which is the main contribution.  \n\nReferences:\na.
