{"title": "Interesting new take on GNN with the non-backtracking operator", "review": "Graph Neural Networks(GNN) are gaining traction and generating a lot of interest. In this work, the authors apply them to the community detection problem, and in particular to graphs generated from the stochastic block model. The main new contribution here is called \"line graph neural network\" that operate directly over the edges of the graph, using efficiently the power of the \"non backtracking operator\" as a spectral method for such problems.\n\nTraining such GNN on data generated from the stochastic block model and other graph generating models, the authors shows that the resulting method can be competitive on both artificial and real datasets.\n\nThis is definitely an interesting idea, and a nice contribution to GNN, that should be of interest to ICML folks.\n\nReferences and citations are fine for the most part, except for one very odd exception concerning one of the main object of the paper: the non-backtracking operator itself! While discussed in many places, no references whatsoever are given for its origin in detection problems. I believe this is due to (Krzakala et al, 2013) ---a paper cited for other reasons--- and given the importance of the non-backtracking operator for this paper, this should be acknowledged explicitly.\n\nPro: Interesting new idea for GNN, that lead to more powerful method and open exciting direction of research. A nice theoretical analysis of the landscape of the graph. \n\nCon:The evidence provided in Table 1 is rather weak. The hard phase is defined in terms of computational complexity (polynomial vs exponential) and therefore require tests on many different sizes.\n\n", "rating": "9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
