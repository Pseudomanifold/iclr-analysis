{"title": "Nice first try but needs improvement", "review": "The topic of this paper is interesting; however, the significance of the work can be improved.  I recommend that the authors test the vulnerability of node embeddings on various random graph models.  Examples of random graph models include Erdos-Renyi, Stochastic Kronecker Graph, Configuration Model with power-law degree distribution, Barabasi-Albert, Watts-Strogatz, Hyperbolic Graphs, Block Two-level Erdos-Renyi, etc.  That way we can learn what types of networks are more susceptible to attacks on random-walk based node embeddings and perhaps look into why some are more vulnerable than others.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
