{"title": "Learning and Planning with a Semantic Model ", "review": "This work proposes a hybrid model for robot visual navigation in synthetic indoor environments, specifically a combination of a  high-level planning scheme (model-based) with a low-level behavior based approach (model-free) . The main contribution is on the high-level based planning that is based on semantic cues from the environment, specifically the construction of a semantic prior about rooms connectivity. By using this prior the system is able to generalize to new environments simplifying an initial robot exploration phase. \n\nThe semantic prior is implemented by the construction of a graph representation that encodes room connectivity. Links between rooms (nodes) are given by Bernoulli variables which are inferred by previous experiences and an exploration phase in the current environment.  \n\nResults are one of the weaker parts of the paper, success rates are very low, even for short planning horizons (figures 3,4,5).  Furthermore, it is not clear the real relevance of the semantic prior because relative performance with respect to baselines is not significant. In general, while a room connectivity prior can be of help, I believe is not so critical for indoor robot navigation. There are prior works on Robotics that has shown more impact using structural priors, such as, presence of corridors, doors, etc, or \"object-room\" spatial relations. The low success rate is even more critical if one considers that the validation is based on synthetic environments.\n\nIn general the paper is easy to follow, although, there are some details missing, specially in terms of model description. My main concern is that the paper is limited in technical novelty and it suffers from a lack of practical significance.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
