{"title": "Good paper, but lack of theoretical analysis", "review": "This paper proposes active learning with partial feedback, which means at each step, the learner actively chooses both which example to label and which binary question to ask, then learn the multi-class classifier with these partial labels. Three different sampling strategies are used during active learning. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed ALPF strategy outperforms existing baselines on the predicting accuracy under a limited budget.\n\nThis paper is well-written. The main ideas and claims are clearly expressed. ALPF combines active learning with learning from partial labels. This setting is interesting and important, especially when the number of categories is large and share some hierarchical structure. The experimental results are promising. My main concern about this work is the lack of theoretical guarantees, which is usually important for active learning paper. it\u2019s better to provide some analysis on the efficiency of ALPF to further improve the quality of the paper.\nI have the following questions for the authors:\n+Why vanilla active learning strategy does not work well? Which uncertainty measurement do you use here?\n+The performances of this work heavily rely on the taxonomy of labels, while in some cases the taxonomy of labels is not tree structure but a graph, i.e. a label may belong to multiple hyper-labels. Can ALPF still work on these cases?\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
