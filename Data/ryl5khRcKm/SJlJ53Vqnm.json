{"title": "This is an application oriented paper with little technical contribution", "review": "This paper designed a GapNet-PL architecture and applied GapNet-PL, DenseNet, Multi-scale CNN etc. to the protein image (multi-labels) classification dataset.\n\nPros:\n\n1. The proposed method has a good performance on the given task. Compared to the claimed baselines (Liimatainen et al. and human experts), the proposed architecture shows a much higher performance.\n\nCons:\n\n1. The novelty of the proposed architecture is limited. The main contribution of this work is the application of CNN-based methods to the specific biological images.\n\n2. The existing technical challenge of this task is not significant and the motivation of the proposed method could be hardly found in this paper. \n\n3. The baselines are not convincing enough. Since the performance of Liimatainen et al. is calculated on a different test dataset, the results here are not comparable. The prediction from a human expert, which may vary from individuals, fails to provide a confident performance comparison.\n\n4. Compared to the existing models (DenseNet, Multi-scale CNN etc.), the performance improvement of the proposed model is limited.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
