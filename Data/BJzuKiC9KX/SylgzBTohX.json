{"title": "Revisiting Reweighted Wake-Sleep", "review": "This manuscript investigates the performance of Reweighted Wake-Sleep (RWS) framework for learning deep generative models with discrete latent variables. It gives a clear introduction to variational autoencoder based models for scenarios with discrete latent variables, including IWAE and also models based on continuous relaxations of discrete variables. The paper performs several experiments, which suggest that RWS is more appropriate for discrete latent variables than other methods such as IWAE. Especially, increasing the number of particles, unlike IWAE, always enhances the performance of RWS.\n\nWhile this paper investigates an important problem, and also offers interesting observations, it lacks a rigorous analysis of why the RWS performance is consistently better than IWAE. More precisely, the propositions should be stated in more formal language and they should be accompanied with a minimal rigorous justification.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
