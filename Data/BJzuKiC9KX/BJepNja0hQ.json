{"title": "Nice experimental discoveries", "review": "This paper conducts an extensive set of experiments on RWS and compares it against a set of benchmarks such as GMM and IWAE. The main contribution of the paper is the fact revealed by these experiments, that RWS learns better models and inference networks with increasing numbers of particles, and that its benefits extend to continuous latent variable models as well. The performance of RWS will increase significantly if we increase the number of particles. \n\nThe experimental part is written in an inspiring way, and I enjoyed reading it. However, there should be stronger baselines incorporated. for example, https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.07445. Also, I think the authors could try to emphasize more on the shortcomings of RWS discovered by the GMM experiments, and how defensive importance sampling fixes it. There are several other parts in the paper that indicates interesting facts, diving deeper into it could possibly lead to more interesting findings.\n\nIn all, I would consider these comparison results important to be somewhere in the literature, but because its lack of rigorous analysis and explanation for the observations, I personally think these observations alone are not novel enough to be an ICLR paper. \n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
