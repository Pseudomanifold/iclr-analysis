{"title": "review", "review": "This paper gives a new algorithm for learning parameters of neural network under several assumptions: 1. the threshold for the first layer is very high; 2. the future layers of the neural network can be approximated by a polynomial. 3. The input distribution is Gaussian.\n\nIt is unclear why any of these assumptions are true. For 1, the thresholds in neural networks are certainly not as high as required in the algorithm (for the threshold in the paper after the first layer the neurons will be super sparse/often even just equal to 0, this is not really observed in real neural networks). For 2, there are no general results showing neural networks can be effectively approximated by low degree polynomials, and, if the future networks can be approximated, what prevents you from just assuming the entire neural network is a low degree polynomial? People have tried fitting polynomials and that does not perform nearly as well as neural networks.\n\nThe proof of the paper makes the problem even more clear because the paper shows that with this high threshold in the first layer, the future layers just behave linearly. This is again very far from true in any real neural networks.\n\nOverall I'm OK with making some strong assumptions in order to prove some results for neural networks - after all it is a very difficult problem. However, this paper makes too many unrealistic assumptions. It's OK to make one of these assumptions, maybe 2, but 3 is too much for me.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
