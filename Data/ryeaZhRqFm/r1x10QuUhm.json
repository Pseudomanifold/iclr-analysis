{"title": "Interesting and important problem; technical contribution is limited given existing work.", "review": "This paper proposed Neural Hyperlink Predictor (NHP) to perform link prediction based on graph convolutional network (GCN). Following prior work, the hyperlink prediction is perform in the dual hypergraph, where each node represents a hyperlink in the primal hypergraph. The original problem is then equivalent to a simple node classification problem. To deal with directed hyperlink, a separate term is added to distinguish heads from tails.\n\nThe problem of link prediction in hypergraph is important and interesting, especially in the chemistry domain. However from the technical point of view, this work is somewhat incremental since prior work has done link prediction using GCN (Zhang and Chen, 2018). The idea of performing hyperlink prediction in the dual hypergraph is not new, either (Lugo-Martinez and Radivojac, 2017). As for the directed hypergraph setting, it seems to be a straightforward extension once one knows how to do in the undirected setting (adding an extra term to classify head/tail).\n\nIn terms of experiments, given the similarity between Lugo-Martinez and Radivojac, 2017 and NHP (both operates in the dual hypergraph), it would be better if the former could also be used as a baseline, as least in the undirected setting.\n\nIt is reasonable to have a subset of links as candidate reactions in the metoboli network datasets. For CORA and DBLP, it is not clear where the \u2018actual papers\u2019 and \u2018candidate papers\u2019 come from. For example in CORA there are 1072 authors; yet there are only 5416 candidate papers.\n\nIt seems the joint learning of NHP-D does not improve the accuracy in the directed setting as claimed in Sec. 5.2. Besides, there is no baseline in the directed setting. It is difficult to appreciate the performance in Sec. 6. One thing one can do is to use previous methods in the undirected setting, e.g., CMM, with the extra term L_d in Eq. (4).\n\nMinor comments:\nTypo: \nP5: atleast -> at least\nP5: What is GCN 2?\nSec. 5: \u2018p = 32 in 1\u2019 and \u2018shown in 2\u2019\n\nMissing references on link prediction and/or deep learning:\nDiscriminative relational topic models.
