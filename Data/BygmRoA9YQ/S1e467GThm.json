{"title": "Synthetic naive approach to handling distorted images by deep neural networks", "review": "The paper presents a synthetic naive approach to analyzing distorted, especially noisy, images through deep neural networks. It uses an existing gating network to discriminate between clean and noisy images, averaging and denoising the latter, so as to somewhat improve the results obtained if no such separation was used. It deals with a well known problem using the deep neural network formulation. Results should be compared to other image analysis methodologies, avoiding smoothing when not required, that can be used for the same purpose.  This should also be reflected in related work in section 2; the reason of including Table 1 in it seems unclear. \n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
