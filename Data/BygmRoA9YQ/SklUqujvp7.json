{"title": "Weak novelty and significance", "review": "Summary\nThis paper introduced a parameterized image processing technique to improve a robustness of visual recognition systems against noisy input data. The proposed method is composed of two components; a denoising network that suppresses the noise signals in an image, and gating network that predicts whether to use the original input image or the one produced by the denoising network. The proposed idea is evaluated on three tasks of object detection, tracking and action recognition. \n\nOriginality and significance:\nThe originality of the paper is very limited since the paper simply combines the existing image denoising technique with the idea of gating. The practical significance of the work is also limited since the model is trained and evaluated with only synthetically generated noise patterns; it is not surprising that the proposed method (both denoising and gating networks) works under this setting, as the noise is created synthetically under the same setting in both training and testing. To demonstrate the practical usefulness, it would be great if the model is evaluated with the actual source of noises (e.g. noises from input sensors, distortion by image compression, etc).  \n\nClarity:\nI think the title of the paper is misleading; the proposed model is actually not a mixture of preprocessing units, as it combines *a* denoising unit together with identity mapping. The gating network is also not designed to incorporate a mixture of more than two preprocessing units, as it outputs only \u201con/off switches\u201d instead of weights for K mixture components (K>2).\n\nMinor comments:\n1) the paper argued the importance of lightweight preprocessing but have not provided analysis on computation costs. From the current results, I don\u2019t see the clear benefit of the proposed method (denoising network) over the average filtering considering the tradeoff between computation vs. performance. \n2) In Figure 5, I suggest highlighting the differences among the examples for clarity.\n", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
