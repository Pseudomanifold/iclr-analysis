{"title": "Good writing and results, with limited novelty", "review": "This paper is well written and achieved good performance on Middlebury benchmark. However, I don't see much novelty. The authors claim two contributions:\n\n(1) An end-to-end unsupervised learning with the smoothness constraint for video frame interpolation.\nHowever, it is quite similar to approaches that learn optical flow in unsupervised manner, with image reconstruction loss and local smoothness loss. \n\n(2) Highly accurate frame interpolation network that integrates motion information estimated by a flow estimation network as a driver for the motion-guided frame interpolator.\nI believe this step is crucial to the final good performance, but it is similar to synctx [cvpr18]. \n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
