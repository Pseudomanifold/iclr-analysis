{"title": "Semantic parsing model with a domain-agnostic intermediate decoding step", "review": "This paper describes a two-stage encoder-decoder model for semantic parsing. The model first decodes a cross-domain schema (CDS) representation from the input utterance, then decodes the final logial form from both the utterance and CDS. The model outperforms other multitask Seq2Seq models on the Snips (Goo et al., 2018) dataset, but is still behind the traditional slot-filling models (Goo et al., 2018).\n\nMy main concern is that it is unclear to me how CDS (cross-domain schema) can be generalized to the other semantic parsing datasets, e.g., the Overnight dataset (Wang et al., 2015), which also contains multiple domains. \n\nI think it would be nice to have some details about the CDS in the paper. For example, I\u2019m wondering 1) how is this CDS designed? 2) how are the CDS annotations derived from the target output? \n\nThere are other details missing regarding the comparisons and the evaluation metrics. In 4.2, the authors mentioned \u201cWe use accuracy as the evaluation metric\u2019\u2019, does \u201caccuracy\u201d mean full logical form accuracy or accuracy on execution results?\n\n* More minor comments:\nIn the first paragraph of Section 3, \u201cirrelevant to domain\u2019\u2019 -> \u201cdomain-general\u2019\u2019 or \u201cdomain-agnostic\u2019\u2019?\n\nIt will be nice to write something more specific than \u201cexplore more ways to make it work better\u201d in the future work.\n\nThis paper has some grammatical errors and formatting issues (e.g. missing space before punctuations).\n\n* Missing references:\nNeural semantic parsing over multiple knowledge-bases, Herzig and Berant, ACL 2017 <- This paper explores shared encoder/decoder for multi-domain semantic parsing, which is very related.\n\n(Concurrent) Decoupling Structure and Lexicon for Zero-Shot Semantic Parsing, Herzig and Berant, EMNLP 2018 \n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
