{"title": "Where's SRL?", "review": "This is a wonderful paper as it seems to have brougth Semantic Role Labelling (SRL) in the context of DL and in the context of voice search. \nResults are interesting but the paper has some major limitations. In fact, the paper totally disregard the work on Semantic Role Labelling and on languages for expressing the general meaning of language in terms of relations and in terms of concepts. \n\nThe first limitation is on the key idea. The key idea of the paper seems to be the existence of an intermediate representation language to encode meaning for utterances. Yet, this intermediate language seems to be the final language with the same relation types (for example, SearchAction) and without representations for the involved concepts (Type that becomes alternatively Film or Weather according to the target final language). This seems to be SRL where the first step is to recognize the relation and, then, the second step is to recognize the roles even if roles are slot filler types in the case of this papers.\n\nThe second limitation is on how the intermediate language has been choosen. What is the relation with FrameNet or VerbNet? Why the authors have not choosen something similar? What are the limitations of these two resources that have forced the authors to disregard them?\n\nMinor problems\n====\n- Why there are not spaces between characters and opening brackets?\n- \"compositional graph based .... language\" is a really large noun compound\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
