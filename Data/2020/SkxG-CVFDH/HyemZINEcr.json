The authors claim that the proposed method for semi-supervised graph learning is based on data augmentation which is efficient and can be applied to different graph neural architectures, that is an architecture-agnostic regularization technique is considered in the paper.\n\nStrength\n\u2022\tSimple yet effective regularization technique to neural networks for graph-structured data\n\nWeaknesses\n\u2022\tWeak technical contribution to the problem\n\u2022\tThe performance gain is from mostly the use of a semi-supervised learning approach based on entropy minimization, which has been developed without consideration of graph-structured data.\n\n\nThe paper does not compare the computational complexity of the proposed approach to the baseline approaches. Although it seems the additional computation cost for the proposed approach compared to the baseline such as GCN does not increase dramatically, it would be better if the authors could provide its computational cost as well as performance given the number of perturbed samples.\n\nAccording to Table 1, self-learning approaches, i.e., GCN (with predicted targets), works comparable to GraphMix. I do not find the benefit of using such a more complicated approach other than simple approaches such as self-learning in the experiment section.\n\nManifold Mixup is not explained properly. For example, the authors may need to explain two random samples, i.e., (x, y) and (x\u2019, y\u2019) are drawn from the data distribution D, and how it is used in GraphMix more clearly.\n\nAdjacency matrix A is used without its definition."}
