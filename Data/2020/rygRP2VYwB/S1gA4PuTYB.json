A proposed method (named SCCG) is a combination of stochastic compositional gradient descent (SCGD) and stochastically controlled stochastic gradient (SCSG). In a theoretical analysis part, a linear convergence rate and a sub-linear convergence rate are derived under the strong convex and non-convex settings, respectively. In experiments, the superior performance of the method to competitors is verified on both of strongly convex and non-convex problems.\n\nClarity:\nThe paper is clear and well written.\n\nQuality:\nThe work is of good quality and is technically sound.\n\nSignificance:\nThe problem treated in this paper is important and contains several applications as mentioned in the paper. Hence, developing an efficient method for this problem is important and interesting. Although derived convergence rates are better than existing primal methods, this paper lacks a comparison with the recently proposed primal-dual method by [A.Devraj & J.Chen (2019)].\n\n[A.Devraj & J.Chen (2019)] Stochastic Variance Reduced Primal Dual Algorithms for Empirical Composition Optimization. NeurIPS, 2019.\n\nA convergence rate obtained in [A.Devraj & J.Chen (2019)] seems faster than that of SCCG for ill-conditioned strongly convex problems. However, there exists a certain setting (large-scale setting) where SCCG outperforms their method. Thus, the contribution of the paper is not lost, but it is better to compare SCCG with the method in [A.Devraj & J.Chen (2019)], empirically and theoretically.\nIf the authors can show an empirical advantage over their method, it will make the paper stronger."}
