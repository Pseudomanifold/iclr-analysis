Namely, the framework is based on the actor-critic paradigm, and uses a conditional query learning model for performing composite actions (selections, rotations) in geometric bin packing. Experiments are performed on several instances of 2D-BPP and 3D-BPP,\n\nOverall, bin packing problems are challenging tasks for DRL, and I would encourage the authors to pursue this research topic. Unfortunately, I believe that the current manuscript is at a too early stage for being accepted at ICLR, due to the following reasons:\n\n(a) The paper is littered with spelling/grammar mistakes (just take the second sentence: \u201cWith the developing\u201d -> \u201cdevelopment\u201d). For the next versions of the manuscript, I would recommend using a spell/grammar checker.\n\n(b) In the related work section, very little is said about Bin Packing Problems. There are various classes of BPPs, and it would be relevant to briefly present them. Moreover, BPPs have been extensively studied in theoretical computer science, with various approximation results. Again, a brief discussion about those results would be relevant. Notably, several classes of geometric bin packing problems admit polynomial-time approximation algorithms (for extended surveys about this topic, see e.g.  Arindam Khan\u2019s Ph.D. thesis 2015; Christensen et. al. Computer Science Review 2017).  \n\n(c) According to the problem formulation and the experiments, it seems that the authors are studying a restricted subclass of 2D/3D bin packing problems: there is only \u201cone\u201d bin, so (it seems that) the authors are dealing with geometric knapsack problems (with rotations). Note that the 2D Knapsack problem with rotations admits a 3/2 + \\epsilon - approximation algorithm (Galvez et. al., FOCS 2017). A. Khan has also found approximation algorithms for the 3D Knapsack problem with rotations. So, even if those results do not preclude the use of sophisticated DRL techniques for solving geometric knapsack problems, it would be legitimate to empirically compare these techniques with the polytime asymptotic approximation algorithms already found in the literature.\n\n(d) The problem formulation is very unclear. Namely, the state representation is ambiguous: $s_p$ is obviously not a boolean variable, but a boolean vector (where each component is associated with an item). Nothing is said about actions and transitions and rewards (we have to read the AC framework in order to get a clue of these components). We don\u2019t know if it is an episodic MDP (which is usually the case in DRL approaches to combinatorial optimization tasks). Also, it seems that the MDP is specified for a single instance of 3D-BPP. But this looks wrong since it should include the distribution of all instances of 3D-BPP.   \n\n(e) The Actor-Critic framework, coupled with a conditional query learning algorithm, is unfortunately unintelligible due to the fact that many notations are left unspecified. For example, in Eq (1) what are the dimensions K and V? In Eq (2) what is d_i? In the algorithm what is n_{gae}? Also in the algorithm, what are l\u2019_i, w\u2019_i and h\u2019_i? Etc. \n\n(f) Even if the aforementioned issues are fixed, it seems that the framework is using many hyper-parameters (\\gamma, \\beta, \\alpha_t, etc.) which are left unspecified. Under such circumstances, it is quite impossible to reproduce experiments. \n"}
