With a new heuristics of conditional queries, the proposed method works favorably with the previous RL-based approach and other baselines. \n\n\nComments:\n\nThe idea of applying reinforcement learning to combinatorial optimization itself is not new. The authors, on the other hand, propose new heuristics, called conditional queries, which divides a unit of actions (rotation, box, and etc.), which turns out to be effective compared to the previous reinforcement-learning based method. \n\n\n"}
