The main idea is to incorporate inductive bias/invariance derived from projective geometry arguments. The experiments seem to clearly show that this new architecture improves previous approaches to tasks which require spatial reasoning and memory, and the ablations studies and visualizations provide useful insights into the workings of the agent. One thing I'm missing is an experiment showing that this inductive bias also doesn't degrade performance on tasks where spatial reasoning is not necessary (as compared to vanilla GRU/LSTM)."}
