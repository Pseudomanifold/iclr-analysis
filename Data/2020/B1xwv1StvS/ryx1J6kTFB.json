The goal of the proposed technique is to incorporate a prior that highlight better the dissimilarity between closely related class prototype. Thus, the proposed paper is related to prototypical neural network (use of prototype to represent a class) but differ from it by using inner product scoring  as a similarity measure instead of the use of euclidean distance. There is also close similarity between the proposed method and matching network \n\n\noverall, the paper does not  highlight the novelty of their proposed method especially prototypical network and matching network. Thus, the related work session is so general and does not tackle the close models in details. The experiments do not provide convincing evidence of the correctness of the proposed approach.\n\nSeveral parts are unclear/incomprehensible:\n(1) The Introduction is confusing and does not demonstrate the problem that the paper is trying to solve. Specifically, the described intuition (Mill\u2019s method of difference) is not convincing \n(2) the first sentence of  the section \u201cOur work.\u201d  (page 1) is long and unclear \u2026  \u201cIn this paper, we propose a model that focuses on the differences in the support set of closely related classes in assigning the class label to a new instance in the novel task.\u201d\n(3) the use of the two level of embedding is confusing and not clear. Figure 1 is also confusion and not clear.\n\nthe correctness of the proposed approach is not proved by the conducted experiment and does not provide convincing and fair comparison with SoA techniques:\n(1) The experiments do not provide the details of the used architecture compared to your baseline.  (how many layers are used in both embedding systems)\n(2) In Table 1 you are using the results reported by Chen et al. (2019) did you use his framework (Resnet or 4 layers CNN)\n\n**Minor comments** \nThe definition of the embedding function f = (f_g o f_f)  (in line 1 page 5) is not consistent with the domain of each function  f_g is defined on R^H x R^H.\n\nK is not defined (last line page 3)\n"}
