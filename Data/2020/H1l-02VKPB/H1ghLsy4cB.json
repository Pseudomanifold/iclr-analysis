More specifically, the proposed method uses an attention operator to compute similarity scores between each node and its neighborhood nodes, and then uses the average similarity score of each node as the ranking score in the node selection process. This topology-aware pooling technique can be applied to graph neural networks on downstream tasks such as graph classification. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which outperform previous state-of-the-art models consistently.\n\nOverall, this paper is well-organized and the contributions are clear. Although the methodology of adding a graph connectivity term is relatively simple, it is effective to improve the performance on graph classification task and should be straightforward to be applied to other graph learning tasks. Based on the above reasons, I would like to recommend a weak accept for this paper."}
