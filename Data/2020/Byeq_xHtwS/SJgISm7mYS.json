This is an interesting idea that has been explored in a different context before (e.g., Deep Image Prior, Ulyanov et al. 2017). There is also plenty of work in the area of exploiting NNs for video compression/encoding (see [1] for instance). However, a bit unusual is the choice of compressing a video into network parameters, which is quite an expensive process using backprop. I could not find any motivation for why this would be a good idea, potentially because the paper does not state any explicit goal/contribution. In any case the authors show merely some mediocre qualitative results. There are no comparisons to prior work and no empirical results. The combination of methods also seems a bit arbitrary.\n\nTherefore this paper has no valuable contribution in its current form and I vote for rejection.\n\nMajor issues\n- No empirical results\n- No comparison to any baseline or prior work\n- Confusing: the paper has almost no structure, e.g., there are almost no sections at all. Symbols are not used consitently (e.g., functions f and g).\n\nQuestions\n- What's the goal of employing normalizing flows in this paper?\n\n[1] Image and Video Compression with Neural Networks: A Review.
