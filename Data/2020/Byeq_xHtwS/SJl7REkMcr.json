In particular, it exploits an autoencoder style convolutional network to compress videos with certain ratios by modulating the number of convolution layers. Furthermore, it studies an autoregressive model to learn the sequential information over videos.\n\nStrength:\nThe idea of using convolutional networks to encode the videos is interesting. \nThe used autoencoder and autoregressive techniques are promising for video encoding. \n\n\nWeakness:\nThe paper gives me an impression that there are very few works to apply convolutional networks (including autoencoder with autoregressive processing) to encode videos. I cannot see any existing works sharing the same motivation, and the paper does not evaluate any related works for comparison. But it seems the use of autoencoder and autoregressive techniques look very straightforward to me. Please clarify the concern. \n\nAbout technical contribution, it is not clear to see if there are any improvement over the conventional autoencoder and autoregressive models. It would be better to make some necessary discussions in the paper. In addition, it seems no descriptions showing how to learn the bijective mappings f_1, ..f_j.\n\nRegarding the evaluation, the paper uses visual results and multi-scale SSIM (mssim) to study the effectiveness of the proposed method on the KTH and DAVIS\u201917 datasets. While a small number of video frames are used, it would be necessary to evaluate the overall (average) mssim on the whole dataset. \n\nThere are quite a few typos or grammatical problems on sentences such as \u201c...algorithms which encode sequences of video image frames.\u201d, \u201cf is some convolutional neural network\u2026\u201d, \u201canalogous to the use of key-frames in standard compression algorithms. \n"}
