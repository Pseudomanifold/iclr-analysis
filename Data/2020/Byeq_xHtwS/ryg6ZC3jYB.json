It seems to contain a variety of weakly related motivational examples.  The paper begins by stating the computer vision advanced due to \"ability to search for suitable task algorithms via differentiable programming.\" But I don't think this claim is reasonable, i.e., I don't think CNNs are searching for task algorithms. \n\nThen the paper explains Kolmogorov complexity, but this is completely unrelated to the rest of the paper. At no point in this paper is this concept used and this motivation is not useful.\n\nThe paper then introduces the method, which is a standard, simple autoencoder. Some image evaluations of this are shown, but no contribution in terms of the model is made.\n\nFinally, the paper briefly mentions some connections to cryptography, but it is unclear what or why this connection matters.\n\nThe paper has no real experimental analysis, it doesn't seem to propose anything new or make any clear contribution, and overall, is quite unclear on what it is trying to do. The current paper is unsuitable for publication. "}
