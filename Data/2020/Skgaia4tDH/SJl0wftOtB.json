Images generated based local VAE are shown to be better than those generated bu \\beta-VAE in general in terms of generation quality and disentanglement/compactness/informativeness.\n\nThis paper shows an interesting idea of viewing neighbourhood of a data point as a task to adopt the meta-learning concept to  train VAE which gives superior performance.\n\nHowever, this paper falls short regarding its overall organisation of the paper and the way that different concepts being articulated which make it hard to follow and read. It is not easy to understand the linkage between a task and a neighbourhood being advocated without re-reading the paper for a few times. It seems to me that very substantial effort is needed for the revision to reach the ICLR standard.\n\nThe introduction section should be carefully rewritten to explain clearly the notions of locality and structural relationship. As far as I can see in the subsequent sections, the locality/structural relationship seems to be referring to the neighbourhood either in the input space or the latent space. Also, the way of discussing local learning should be elaborated a bit to make it clear what exact notion of local learning  is being presented.\n\n\nSpecific comments:\n\nPage 2: \n\u201csince the most dataset tends to be governed by the consistent rules of the physical world\u201d\n->\n\u201csince most dataset tends to be governed by the consistent rules of the physical world\u201d\n\n\u201cSuch kind of dataset has a multi-scale structure from a local to a global scale.\u201d - some grammatical issue\n\nPage 5:\nLine 4: Equation 3 seems not related to meta-learning\n"}
