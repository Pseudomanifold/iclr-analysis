The authors propose entailment and contradiction operators that learn entailment and contradiction scores while training the parameters of the sentence encoders.\n\nThis is an interesting approach, however the experiments make me doubt the effectiveness of the proposed method. Admittedly, the authors do point out that at the cost of fewer training parameters, the proposed approach attains the same performance as NLI encoders with MLP based or attention based classifiers. However, the question becomes, how many fewer parameters are being learned to accept a performance that is in the same ball park but that does not exceed the SOTA.\n\nThe authors should have tried to an ablation type of approach in equation 1, to check if concatenation alone, element wise dot product alone or absolute difference alone or a combination of any two would work better with the scoring function.\n\nThis paper while taking a step in the right direction, seems a little premature for publication. That being said, the reported results my be of some value after all. It is hard to narrow down on the exact contributions of this paper."}
