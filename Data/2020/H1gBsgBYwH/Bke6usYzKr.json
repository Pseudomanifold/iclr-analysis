Their main results can be summarized as follows.\n1. If only the second layer is optimized, they observe the double-descent phenomenon.\n2. However, if only the first layer is optimized, the double-descent is not observed.\nThis shows that recent results for certain linear models (e.g. Song, Montanari 2019) do not directly transfer to neural networks. As the authors point out, however, if a different scaling is used in the asymptotics, double descent might still be observed.\n\nI see the following strengths of the paper. \n-This is a very well-written paper with a clear message.\n-The result is important and gives new insights into the generalization properties of neural networks.\n\nIn my view, this is an interesting contribution, which should be accepted.
