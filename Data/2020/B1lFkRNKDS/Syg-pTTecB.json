The proposed method attempts to adjust the weights of the convolution kernel with context information. Experiments show that this context gated convolution layer can improve the performance of CNN on image classification and action recognition to some extent.\n\nCons:\n1. I don't agree with the first contribution. Previous studies like deformable convolution, attentive convolution, etc., are following the same direction and highly related. In addition, using context information to perform gating is incremental.\n2. I would like to know how the exact inference speed will be influenced with CGC. The computational complexity in terms of big O notation is not enough.\n3. Considering point 1, comparison with more baselines is desired.\n"}
