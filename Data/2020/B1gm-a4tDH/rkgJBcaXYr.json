It views treatment effect as an exogenous variable and represent that with one additional parameter in the model.\n\nThere is not enough novelty with the proposed method. It only extends Kidzinski and Hastie (2018) by adding one extra parameter that represents the average additive treatment effect. And this new model does not outperform the previous model in  Kidzinski and Hastie (2018) significantly.\n\nThe method also does not perform significantly better on real data. Given the real data  as a 1-d vector of length 6k, the method learns a 9x9 latent matrix to represent the data. And the method beats, but not significantly, the intuitive weak baseline rMean which uses the mean of the same patient\u2019s previous visits for future prediction.\n\n\n\n\n"}
