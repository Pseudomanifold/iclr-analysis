There is no significant theoretical innovation in this paper. Specifically, the learning approach for optimizing the parameter set W in the presence of \\mu is not much different from the one proposed by (Kidzinski & Hastie, 2018) and the optimal value of \\mu is simply the solution for L2 loss function. Besides, the narrative of section 2 shares too much similarity with the context of Kidzinski & Hastie, 2018.\n\n2. The practical significance of the paper is rather limited considering that the framework can only take into account one specific treatment at a time when training a model. There are usually different treatments for a certain disease and it is hard to control enough patients to all take the same treatment. Sometimes, even the same patient could take multiple treatments at the same time or along his trajectory. \n\n3. The paper is poorly written. There are too many grammatical errors. Some sentences are hard to understand. E.g. \u201cTreatments of various types, however, rely on human decisions and to some extent, an exogenous variable to the development of disease. Thus they need to modeled differently.\u201d should be \u201cTreatments of various types, however, rely on human decisions and to some extent, are exogenous variables to the development of disease. Thus they need to be modeled differently.\u201d. \u201cwe add a penalty term on the nuclear norm of W .\u201d, Do you mean \u201cwe add a penalty term which is the nuclear norm of W .\u201d? Cause I don\u2019t see any additional penalty term in the nuclear norm compared with equation 2.2. \u201c...where (I_S)_{i,j} = 1 if and only T_i \u2265 s(i)...\u201d should be \u201c...where (I_S)_{i,j} = 1 if and only if T_i \u2265 s(i)...\u201d. \u201cFinally we show that if the sequence {(\\mu_{\\lambda}^{(k)}, W_{\\lambda}^{(k)} )}_k, it has to converge to a solution of (4.1).\u201d Grammatically speaking, the if clause is not even a complete clause.
