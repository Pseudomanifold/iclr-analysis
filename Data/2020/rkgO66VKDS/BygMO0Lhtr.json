This is an important research are both for applications (e.g., deploying neural networks on embedded systems or other constrained hardware, or increasing throughput on a production system) and for theoretical reasons (e.g., potentially modelling the behavior of biological neural networks).\n\nThe paper makes two primary contributions: (1) It proposes a new approximation for the gradient of the quantized data with respect to the step size parameter (equation 3) based on the well-known straight through estimator. (2) It proposes a heuristic for scaling gradient updates based on the number of weights in a given layer and the quantization levels (clipping thresholds). Experimental results showing higher accuracy than previously reported approaches in a number of settings and for common metrics, and best-to-date results for other settings.\n\nI recommend the paper for publication.\n\nIn terms of improving the paper further, the authors could expand their experiment section. E.g., how does their method compare to current SOTA knowledge-distillation methods; how does it deal with other architectures (recurrent models, attention, etc).\n\nMinor notes on the manuscript:\n\nIn section 3.4, both the term \u201cpopulation size\u201d as well as the symbol N_W come without any definition. While closer reading makes it clear what is meant is the number of weights per layer, a definition closer to their first usage would be good. This goes in particular for N_W which comes in several versions (N_W, N, nweights).\n\nIn section 3.7, the sentence starting with \u201cWe found that using this approach to distill\u201d does not seem to fit within its context for this reader, as it describes \u201cfull-to-full\u201d distillation. Perhaps it is meant to read \u201clow precision student network\u201d?"}
