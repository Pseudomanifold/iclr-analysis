Unlike convolutional layers, the fixed grouping layer only allows the output to be impacted by the specific inputs associated to it by its group. The paper stays firmly in the area of brain scans with the authors hoping to generalize to other applications later. Their experiments compare to what they consider to be the state-of-the-art approaches to the problem. \n\nI did find Figure S2A helpful to quickly understand some of the simulated data approach, maybe it should be in the paper and not supplementary. \n\nI argue for accepting this paper because the experiments, while focused solely in one discipline, are thorough. I would have liked clearer description of other areas that might benefit in the last sentence. "}
