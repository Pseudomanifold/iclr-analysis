HaarPooling has a mathematically formalism derived from compressive Haar transforms. HaarPooling takes into account both graph the structure and features of the graph-structured input data to compute a coarsened representation. HaarPooling can be applied in conjunction with any type of graph convolution in GNNs. Experimental results verified the efficacy of the proposed method.\n\nThe writing, organization and presentation are satisfactory. \n\nMy comments regarding this paper are as below.\n1) More experiments on real tasks (e.g., multi-human parsing or pose estimation, etc.), both quantitatively and qualitatively, should be supplemented to further verify the superiority claimed in this paper.\n2) The main contributions of this paper are not clear to me, compared with other SOTAs."}
