The authors apply the proposed embedding method on two tasks: in-hospital mortality and length of stay prediction.\n\nClarity\nThe background, experiment settings and some frequently used words are not explained well. E.g., what is and how to apply binary masks(BM). Simply saying that \u201ca regular LSTM\u201d and \u201ca self-attentive LSTM\u201d are used as baselines is not acceptable.\n\n\nSignificance \nThe approach described in this paper barely improves the prediction results. The experiments are not solid enough to support the claim in the paper, as well.\n\n\nMinor comments\n- lots of grammar mistakes: e.g. \u201dAs a CNN do not consider... \u201d(Sec. 3.1, p.2); also sentences above and below eq(1) and eq(2) (p.2).\n- The main manuscript only has 6 pages.\n"}
