It is an interesting idea but the paper lacks motivation and clarity on the technical content. Too implementation details are discussed, making it hard to grasp the basic ideas and motivation for the work.\n\nI didn't understand the clear motivation for the problem setting considered in this paper. Why combine three datasets? What is real world scenario where it is desired to do both task oriented dialog and chit chat together? Are we arguing that dialog dataset from chit chat can help learn task driven dialogues and vice versa?\n\nSome of the baseline models considered in the paper are not really dialog models but neural networks employed in the proposed dialog modeling setting.\n\nI would like to see human evaluation for any dialog model. Otherwise, we are throwing arrows in the dark.\n\nI didn't understand a clear motivation for using SQL queries, and authors emphasize upon it at multiple places.\n\n\n\n"}
