On a more detailed level it is not clear why the log n representation for items is choosen -- why not just map to embeddings directly? The more interesting question of how to generalize to unseen items (how would that be possible given that items have no representation at all) is not discussed at all and seems not to be realizable, which makes the starting point of such methods (items have no representation) questionable.\n\nThe paper also misses relevant citations of similar questions from the field of (probabilistic) matrix factorization and relational learning."}
