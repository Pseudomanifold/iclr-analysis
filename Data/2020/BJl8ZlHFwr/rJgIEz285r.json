This paper modifies traditional VAE method with attribute matching prior to release the hidden features from original regularization. This paper also proposes a domain discriminator to enhance class-separability of learned features to avoid unseen classes to be covered by seen classes. Experiment results show their efficiency under relation-based setting.\n\nPros:\n1.This paper proposes an important insight that in generalized ZSL, the unseen classes may be dominated by seen classes in the feature space.\n2.An easy but efficient domain discriminator method is proposed to separate different classes to avoid domination. \n3.Even without large synthetic learning architecture, the proposed method gets comparable results.\n\nComments:\n1.The proposed MCMVAE is No-longer a VAE but an AE with attribute matching loss. Except that a new theory of MCMVAE is proposed, it is not rigorous to relate MCMVAE to VAE.\n2.Add results using synthetic architecture to get a better result will make this method more reliable.\n3.Why discriminator is harmful for PSE method?\n"}
