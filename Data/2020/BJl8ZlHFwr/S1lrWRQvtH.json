As showing in the numerical experiments on some real data, the method demonstrates the significant improvement on the accuracy of prediction comparing to some state-of-the-art methods. \nThe main key of the method is using Variational Inference, variational autoencoders. The authors have taken into account the modality of the data through reparametrize the distributions, especially the inside class invariant modality and class separability. Moreover, the authors also propose to take into account a kind of biasness domain into the learning procedure, which details in adding a regularization of the domain discriminator into the objective function.\n\nThe paper is nicely written, espcially with a clear formal introduction to the problem of GZSL.\n\nHowever, I have some questions:\n1) Does the test set has some labels? How do you know your method works well? I can not find where you have defined a kind of loss so that we can compare the predicted labels \\hat{y}_j ?  (In Section 2.)\n2) How do you learn the \"replaced prior\" in equation (4) ?\n3) It is not enough detail on how do you optimize the objective (8) ? a detail explain algorithm would make the paper significant, indeed.\n4) In Table1, would MCMVAE in the last row be MCMVAE-D ?\n\nFinal, I expect the authors will make their codes available for the readers."}
