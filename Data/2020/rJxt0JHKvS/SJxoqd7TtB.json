Based on this coloring scheme, a colored local iterative procedure is built. Experimental studies are performed and demonstrate the effectiveness of the methods.\n\n1. A major concern for this method is the permutation invariant in coloring scheme. In this work, nodes in a group is colored randomly. This means the graph will change with different coloring patterns. In section 5.3, inf-CLIP is claimed to be permutation invariant. However, this property can not be guaranteed for a normal k.\n\n2. The experimental studies are weak. There should be some ablation studies to evaluate the effectiveness of the coloring scheme. In section 7.2, the ablation studies are performed on synthetic datasets. Why not use real data?\n\n3. This paper exceeds 8 pages which means higher requirements are needed. The novelty of this paper is incremental and not technically sound.\n\nSuggestions:\n\nFigure out ways to ensure permutation invariant would be a great plus."}
