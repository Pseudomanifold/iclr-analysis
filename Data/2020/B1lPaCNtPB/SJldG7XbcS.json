They carry out this idea with some theoretical arguments, and their method is shown to perform very well in empirical experiments on one synthetic dataset, and three real world datasets:CelebA, CIFAR-10, and FFHQ. Overall I feel this is a well presented paper with a simple yet interesting idea and solid results. The authors are encouraged to share their code and results to public.\n"}
