Moreover  in the paper it is stated that, they tested the new algorithm with the original BoxWorld environment, but they omitted it as the proposed algorithm excelled over the old one in such environments. Also the relational induction algorithm used in this paper does not seem to be the same as the one used by Zambaldi et al.\n\nSecond, Im concerned about the explanation made where they try to justify that the use of the bridge-BoxWorld which is argued to provide a more complex logical structure because of the use of linear logic-formulas using more connectives. In other words, the question arises as to whether the authors thought that a more complex logical structure would i mply a more complex environment, thus justifying the use of the bridge-BoxWorld. \n\nFinally, it is worth reiterating that, although the use of simplices and simplicial complexes is a very interesting idea, especially to provide a mathematical explanation of how attention works in the Transformer, it\u2019s not entirely obvious  whether the implementation of the 2-simplicity Transformer really presents an improvement over the original Transformer, in the learning of abstract representation.
