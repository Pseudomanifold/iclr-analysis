With spatio-temporal embedding loss, it is claimed to generate temporally consistent video instance segmentation. The authors show that the proposed method performs nicely on tracking and segmentation task, even when there are occlusions.\n\nOverall, this paper is well-written. Section 3 clearly explains the loss functions. The main idea is not very complex, but generally makes sense. The authors mention that scenes are assumed to be mostly rigid, and appearance change is mostly due to the camera motion. I would like to see more argument about this, as there are cases if this is obviously not true; for instance, human changes pose significantly. If we limit the range of discussion to some narrow domain, such as self-driving, this might be more valid, but we may want to see some discussion about validity of this assumption.\n\nSome modules are not full explained in detail. For example, what is the background mask network? Which model was used, and how was it trained?\n\nIn experiment, the proposed method shows nice score on MOTSA and sMOTSA, but all other metrics, it is on the worse side. The authors are encouraged to discuss more about the metrics and experimental results with the other metrics as well. Other than these, the experiment was well-designed and conducted."}
