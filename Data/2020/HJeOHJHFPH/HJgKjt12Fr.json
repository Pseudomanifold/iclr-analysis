Experimental results on CelebA and Menpo verified the efficacy of the proposed method.\n\nThe writing and presentation are good. The problem solved in this paper aligns with real applications.\n\nMy concerns regarding this paper are as below.\n1) What are the training computational complexity and testing time cost of the proposed method compared with other SOTAs, since speed is very important for real applications.\n2) The datasets compared in this paper are quite old, more experiments on more recent challenging benchmarks are needed to verify the superiority of the proposed method, e.g., IJB-/C.\n3) How did the authors create the low-quality images? How did the authors ensure that such created low-quality images can represent real scenarios?\n4) Some related works should be discussed, e.g., Cross-Resolution Face Recognition via Prior-Aided Face Hallucination and Residual Knowledge Distillation [Kong et al., 2019], 3D-Aided Dual-Agent GANs for Unconstrained Face Recognition [Zhao et al., T-PAMI 2018].\n5) Format of references should be consistent."}
