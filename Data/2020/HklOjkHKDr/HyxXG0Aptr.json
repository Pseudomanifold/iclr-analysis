They demonstrate the utility of this on the four rooms domain, outperforming the unrelated node2vec algorithm.\n\nThis paper should be rejected.\n\nThe algorithm isn't really novel, it is a nearly equivalent to the successor features under a fixed policy (discounted expected feature occupancy), but with the strange choice of being recursively defined in terms of /Psi rather than /Phi.\n\nThere are no relevant baselines. SF under a uniform policy at minimum, UFSA with all greedy training policies ideally.\n\nThe four rooms environment is also far too trivial for being the sole experiment in a theory-less paper. Why not use the environments discussed in all of the other SF literature?"}
