Multiplicative interactions can be viewed as an effective way of integrating contextual information in a network. Through a series of thorough empirical experiments, this paper demonstrates superior performance on a variety of tasks (RL, sequence modeling) when a such multiplicative interaction module is incorporated.\n\nThe framework seems applicable for learning tasks where a latent variable or context embedding presents. And the paper hypothesizes that multiplicative interactions can help introduce desirable inductive biases, therefore leading to improved generalization performance. However, the theoretical intuition and justification for such hypothesis is missing, which weakens the contribution of the paper. \n\nIn Table 1, the model LSTM with Multiplicative Decoder has more parameters (105M) than the vanilla LSTM in comparison (88M). It\u2019d be good to provide a more fair comparison by slightly increasing the capacity of baseline LSTM model (e.g., using larger output dimension to match the capacity). This will rule out the cofounding factor that the improved performance is due to the algorithm instead of increased model capacity. \n\nIn Section 8, it\u2019d be convincing if the authors can also report results for replacing default LSTM cell with multiplicative interactions. In paragraph 3, the authors only discussed the feasibility conceptually, without providing experimental results to support this argument. \n"}
