The analysis and math are clear, and the main points are made with neither too many nor too few equations. Authors cast several other approaches (gating, attention, Hypernets) within the same formulation, which while not being groundbreaking or overly novel is nice to see compiled into this particular form.\n\nDecision: weak accept.\n\nPros:\n - I can imagine any researcher getting into the field and interested in this sort of thing reading this paper as a canonical, concise, and moderately thorough intro to the concept.\n - Beautiful drawing\n\nCons:\n - Experiments are a little light. To make the paper more thorough, it would be nice to see cases where multiplicative interactions are *not* needed, e.g. if one sticks multiplicative interactions in a network trained to classify MNIST or CIFAR-10, do they help at all? If not, why not?\n - Further ablation studies would also benefit the paper. For example, in the language modeling section, how would the results change with varying bottleneck size? With a completely diagonal approximation? Finally, LSTMs already have multiplicative interactions in them (via gating, as mentioned in the paper). Would the proposed form of multiplicative interaction obviate the need for LSTM gating all together?\n\nWith additional experiments this paper could be a strong accept and recommended reading for many first year grad students. As is, it\u2019s probably still worth accepting.\n", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I assessed the sensibility of the derivations and theory."}
