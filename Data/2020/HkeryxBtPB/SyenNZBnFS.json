In the MMA, the margin in the input space is directly maximized. In order to alleviate an instability of the learning, a softmax variant of the max-margin is introduced. Moreover, the margin-maximization and the minimization of the worst-case loss are studied. Some numerical experiments show that the proposed MMA training is efficient against several adversarial attacks. \n\n* review:\nOverall, this paper is clearly written, and the readability is high. Though the idea in this paper is rather simple and straightforward, some theoretical supports are presented. A minor drawback is the length of the paper. The authors could shorten the paper within eight pages that is the standard length of ICLR paper. \n\n- In proposition 2.4: the loss L^{CE} should be clearly defined. \n- In equation (8), how is the weight of L^CE and L^MMA determined?"}
