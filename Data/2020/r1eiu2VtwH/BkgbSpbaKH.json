The authors propose an architecture (NODE) that satisfies this conditions. NODE is an architecture consisting of differentiable oblivious decision trees that can be trained end to end via back propagation. The paper is readable and the experiments are well presented. They make use of an alpha-entmax transformation to obtain a differentiable architecture. The approach seems well motivated in the literature. It is unclear how novel the contribution is. It is unclear if in the experimental section the datasets used are standard for this classes of tasks. Would be good to mention if it is the case. "}
