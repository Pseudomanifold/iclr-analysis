While past work (VIC, DIAYN) found skills by maximizing the mutual information between skills and states, this paper (LTS) aims to find transitional skills to move between the primitive skills.\n\nThe proposed method is, if the primitive skills found by DIAYN are labeled w_i, to find skills z_[i,j,k] which corresponds to the kth state while transitioning from w_i to w_j. These transition skills are learned jointly with the primitive skills using the mutual information objective.\n\nThe results in the paper are on mountain car, cart pole, and pendulum. The plots show that distinct primitive skills can be learned in these environments, and that the transition skill transitions between them. The results do not show the actual performance of using these skills for any specific task, which was the motivation presented in the introduction. The \n\nIs the approach well motivated?\nThe approach is not well motivated. The paper claims that transitional skills are necessary, but does not show any evidence of an agents behavior improving by using transitional skills. \n\nI argue to reject the paper in its current state; Sections 3 and 4 need to be rewritten to be more easily understandable, and the need for transitional skills should be more empirically motivated.\n\n\nClarity Issues:\n- The method is presented in a very confusing way. I am not confident that I understand how the transitional skills are defined. \n- Figure 2: What is the \u201cstatistical characteristic\u201d and \u201cfeature value\u201d? The vague terms are not defined. Which value? What statistic?\n- Figure 5: I see that LTS transitions more smoothly between skills, but why is DIAYN\u2019s fast transition bad? Clearly it still succeeds at reaching the other state.\n"}
