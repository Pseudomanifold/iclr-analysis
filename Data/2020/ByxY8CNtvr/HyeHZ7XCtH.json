Spectrum Control Regularization was originally proposed and applied to GANs (Jiang et al 2019)\n\nThe author motivate the approach by showing that the singular values of embedding weight matrices, although I am not convinced that it is such a big issue. In terms of experimental results authors show a very slight improvement over strong baseline models, that further shows an evidence that regularization singular values of embedding matrices is not very important. \n\nOverall the paper is written well, however the contribution is very marginal.\n"}
