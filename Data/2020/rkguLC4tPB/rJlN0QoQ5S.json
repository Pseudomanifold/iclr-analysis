The idea is to use an output subnet which use a fully connected layer and a binary tree which encode the product relationship instead of the sum currently used in state of the art method (particularly the softmax with low confidence). The binary tree is made of split nodes which are responsible to produce a probability distribution from the root to each leaf. The max path i.e. the path with the largest probabilities determines the class of the input and can be used to measure how confident the classifier is about the classification decision. Combine multiple subnets and the tool obtained is able to do complex predictions and maintain a good generalization performance. The method also uses an information theory based regularization which decrease the probability of having subnets with uniform probability distribution i.e. a large entropy. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and MNIST against CIFAR-100, SVHN show that the method has an improved rejection accuracy while maintaining a good classification accuracy on the test set.\n\nThe topic of the paper is interesting and the approach seems to be solid, however the experiments are not so convincing. They are limited on two very easy datasets and do not show if the method is able to scale when more difficult and more realistic amount of classes are considered (like in CIFAR-100, SVHN or maybe ImageNet). Given that a simple dataset like these require 9 hour of training, it is also not clear how much the method is able to scale computationally and if it is applicable realistically. Moreover the presentation could be improved as figure 1 and its section 2 are complex and not easy to follow at several points. Hence, I\u2019m leaning towards rejecting this paper.\n\nIn particular:\n- It would be interesting to see experiments where the number of classes is higher than the ones in MNIST and CIFAR-10. CIFAR-100 and SVHN would be a good testbed for such case.\n- How is the complexity of the method and how does it scale with the number of training classes?\n- It is stated that the method bring a 25% percentage points in the accuracy of unknown rejection detection, however table 1 shows a large improvement only in the case of SVHN. Hence the claims seems a bit off compared to the measured data. Moreover, using only CIFAR-10 is insufficient to back up the claim.\n- Why the related work section is at the end of the paper? It confuses the reader and would be more useful to be put after the introduction section.\n\n"}
