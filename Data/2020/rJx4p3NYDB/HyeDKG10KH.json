The idea is to postpone visiting an information set as long as the sum of the (opponent) reach probabilities for the information set after the last strategy update is lower than a certain threshold. This pruning strategy allows one to avoid traversing the whole game tree and significantly speeds up the computation of approximate Nash equilibria. The authors provide detailed theoretical analysis of the proposed algorithm and show that the bound of the overall regret of the proposed algorithm is comparable to that of the original CFR. They conduct experiments using Leduc hold\u2019em and show that the proposed approach gives significantly better results than existing CFR-based algorithms. The downside of the proposed algorithm is that it requires a memory of O(|H|) for bookkeeping, which can be very large and makes it difficult for the algorithm to be applied to large games.\n\nI feel ambivalent about this paper. On the one hand, the paper presents a promising idea for significantly speeding up the CFR algorithm with detailed theoretical justifications, but on the other hand, the (potentially huge) requirement for memory makes me unsure about the strength and practical merit of the algorithm compared to other CFR variants. \n\nI am a bit disappointed that the authors did not compare their algorithm with existing pruning methods on the ground that they do not have theoretical guarantee on running time. I think empirical comparison to the state of the art is always useful and should be conducted whenever possible. Would it be difficult to compare the proposed method with, for example, Brown and Sandholm (2019)?"}
