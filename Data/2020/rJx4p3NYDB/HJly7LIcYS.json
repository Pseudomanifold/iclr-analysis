The paper offers a nice review of online linear optimization and its relationship to CFR, making its proposed algorithm easily digestible. The paper establishes convergence guarantees for lazy-CFR and shows experimentally that lazy-CFR+ outperforms CFR+, a formidable baseline, in Leduc poker. As is discussed in the paper, a major drawback of lazy-CFR is that its space complexity is on the order of the number of histories in the game. This will be an important direction for future work.\n\nThis is a nice paper. The writing is strong and its main idea is both novel and appears to be effective in practice. I have no major criticisms. What I would most like to see is more extensive experimental results. Does lazy-CFR offer similarly strong results other small imperfect information games (Kuhn poker, liar\u2019s dice, etc.)? Additionally, it would be interesting to see how the how lazy-CFR performs compared 1) against discounted-CFR and 2) when combined with discounted-CFR. "}
