The paper presents a bidding agent for the card game contract bridge trained through selfplay. Contract bridge is an imperfect information game which has a bidding and a playing phase. \nThe bidding phase is challenging for computer agents because there are 1047 possible sequences and through the bidding process, the player has to exchange information with his game partner. The agent is trained using deep reinforcement learning without modeling of belief in other agent\u2019s state or using human expert data.\nThe paper is easy to follow, it is almost free of errors and very well structured. The good readability of the text makes it easy to understand the key aspects of the work. The authors give a clear review of the related literature and work done on this field and use the approaches by Yeh & Lin (2016) and Rong et al. (2019) as baselines for their own method. The presented bidding agent is tested against Wbridge5 and outperforms the state-of-the-art approach by Rong et al. (2019). For a better comparison the authors also test the strategy of modelling belief but prove (controlling it via a hyper-parameter) that it doesn't help in training their model. \nA strength of the paper is the interpretation of the training process and its statistical visualization. By investigating the bidding action in the training process the authors can show the learned strategy of the agent which is compared to the mainstream bidding systems of human experts.\nThe game of contract bridge is explained in the appendix which is a big plus so readers who didn't know this card game can follow the shown examples of bidding actions.\nThe authors plan to publish their code, the trained model and the experimental data so the results will be reproduceable for future work. \n\nOverall, I have troubles in assessing the novelty of the system, since it is not my area of expertise. A concern is that there might be better fitting venues for this topic than ICLR."}
