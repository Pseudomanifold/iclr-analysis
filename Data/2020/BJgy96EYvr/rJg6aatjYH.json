The first one is an information-theoretic influence (EITI) bonus and a decision-theoretic influence (EDTI)  bonus. EITI uses mutual information to capture the influence of one agent on the transition dynamics of others,  while EDTI uses an intrinsic reward called Value of Interaction (VoI) to quantify the influence of one agent\u2019s behavior on expected returns of other agents.\n\nMain Comments:\nOverall, I think this paper would be a good contribution for ICLR 2020 and I lean towards accepting it. The experimental section is thorough, the authors include relevant ablations, baselines and popular algorithms used in MARL settings. The use of the decision-theoretic influence is novel as far as I can tell and it also seems to be quite effective on the tasks used for evaluation. Although the method uses a series of approximations and assumptions, I believe most of them are clearly stated and fairly well-motivated (plus they are not very far from those of other recent work in the deep MARL literature). I also appreciated the fact that the authors explicitly derived the main mathematical results used in the paper.\n\nI only have some minor comments and questions regarding some assumptions and notation.\n\nI  also encourage the authors to proof-read the paper as some parts of it are a bit hard to follow. I would very much like to see a more an edited version of this paper with more precise language.\n\nCan you discuss in more detail the difference between EITI and the intrinsic reward based on social influence used in Jacques et al. (2018)? They seem to be quite similar conceptually and the related work part related to this is rather vague. Please clarify the distinction.  \n\nMinor Questions / Comments:\nThere are a few typos throughout the paper:\n\n1. On page 3 after equation (3), I believe part of the sentence that should describe the I term in the equation is missing. \n\n2. The phrase right after equation (16) which defines the EDTI reward does not seems to not match the  above expression. Can you please explain why the transition would be conditioned on the influence term? While reviewing, I\u2019ve been assuming this was just a mistake in writing but please double check and clarify. \n\n3. On page 4, after equation (8), you refer to  a_1, a_1 and s_2\u2019 which do not appear in the above equation. Can you please use the same notation or motivate your choice for referring to those variables instead?\n\n \n"}
