The proposed model uses matrix multiplication for optical flow estimation, where an image is transformed into a vector and the local motion is modeled by a matrix. \nThe recommendation of this work is based on the following reasons. First, the motivation of the proposed method is not convincing. While the proposed ideas are interesting, it is not clear why this approach sheds light on our understanding of motion perception. Is there any psychological evidence to support the proposed model? Or the authors simply take some ideas form V1 model and add a module to \u201cexplain\u201d motion?  Second, the experimental results are not sufficient to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.\nMajor issues:\nFirst, while it is interesting to use matrix multiplication to model motion, it is not clear why the motion between patches I_t[x] and I_{t+1}[x] can be approximated with linear transformation (Section 3.4). Furthermore, it is not clear why the transformation M only depends on the displacement of the center pixel whereas different pixels in a patch I_t[x] could have different displacements. \nSecond, the proposed model for optical flow estimation is only evaluated on the proposed V1Deform dataset. If the authors position this paper \u201cmay shed light on our motion perception in primary visual cortex\u201d, the authors certainly need to carry out sufficient psychophysical experiments. \nMinor issues:\nFirst, Eq. 2 does not seem correct to me. The left and right sides of Eq. 2 have different dimensions.\nSecond, the authors may consider using {} instead of () to define a set of pixels or vectors in Section 3.1.\nThird, while the reconstruction loss (Eq. 7) is used in this paper, I wonder what the results would be like if the authors simply enforce W\u2019W=I instead.\n"}
