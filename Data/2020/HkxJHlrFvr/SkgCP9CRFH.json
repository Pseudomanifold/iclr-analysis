The authors compared the correlation between AVH and human selection frequency with model confidence and feature norm. The results show that both AVH and model confidence have correlation, but AVH has a stronger correlation than model confidence. Differently from the conjecture of [41], feature norm was not correlated with human selection frequency. \n\nNext, the training dynamics of AVH are analyzed. The results show that feature norm keeps increasing during training, whereas AVH hits a plateau very early even when the accuracy or loss is still improving. Also, AVH correlates human selection frequency across different deep models, and it also correlates the model\u2019s accuracies. \n\nAs an application of AVH, the authors applied it to sample selection of self-training for domain adaption. The proposed selection method based on AVC could improve a state-of-the-art self-training method, of which sample selection is based on model confidence of CNN. \n\nOverall, the experimental contribution of this paper is good, and the experimental conditions seem to be correct. \n\nMinor problems. \nIn the analysis of the dynamics of training, the authors compared the AVH with feature norm. How about the dynamics of model confidence? Is it similar to the feature norm? \n\nThe curves of different levels of hardness are missing in Fig.14. \n\n"}
