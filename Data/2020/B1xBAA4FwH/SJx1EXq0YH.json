To evaluate correctness, the authors proposed to study the change in the classification accuracy of the target model, under a perturbed dataset where the most relevant regions (as given by explainer) of the image is preserved and the remaining content is replaced with non-informative backgrounds for the target class. For consistency evaluation, the authors proposed to apply transformations like rotation, translation and flip that doesn\u2019t semantically change the input image. For confidence evaluation, they compared the prediction performance on the original image, masked image (only salient regions) and inverted masked image (only non-salient regions). \n\nMajor\n\u2022\tThe paper lack technical novelty.\n\u2022\tThe confidence component looks redundant and can be incorporated in the correctness component.\n\u2022\tThe inverse saliency map idea is already proposed in \u201cEvaluating the visualization of what a deep neural network has learned\u201d for evaluating saliency maps. There the authors gradually replace the most salient regions with random noise and observe a decrease in prediction accuracy.\n\u2022\tMost of the saliency maps producing methods, generate continuous maps. For making, we need to convert the continuous map to binary by using a threshold. An analysis of choosing different values as threshold is missing. By choosing an appropriate threshold, the size of the most salient region can be controlled. Thus, although Grad-Cam spread saliency over large area, we can use a higher threshold to define the binary mask.\n\u2022\tGrad-CAM, integrated grad and smooth grad are all gradient-based saliency maps. There are perturbation-based saliency maps, which aims to find most salient regions such that removing those regions produce a maximum drop in prediction accuracy.
