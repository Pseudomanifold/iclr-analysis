Several metrics are proposed, including correctness, consistency and confidence. \n\nI like the notion of consistency, where an explainer should produce the same explanation under transformations of the image that does not change its \u201csemantic content\u201d. \n\nHowever, I am confused or unconvinced by several arguments made in the paper, and if the authors can clarify them I am willing to increase my review. I think the major issue is that most metrics are justified with flimsy arguments, not compared with prior work, and do not lead to consistent ranking of the models. \n\nCorrectness: I am not convinced by the correctness evaluation for several reasons\n\n1. The combined image is still out of distribution, and it is unclear why this is better compared to e.g. using a white background. \n2. Does it favor visualization methods with a blob-shaped saliency map vs. scattered dots shaped saliency map? Does it favor methods with a larger salient region? For example, just from visual appeal, I do not think smoothgrad is worse than gradCAM, but the number says otherwise. I think the arbitrariness of this metric makes the numbers hard to believe. \n3. If the original image is already incorrectly classified (since they are the ones where the classifier assigns the lowest probability) it is hard to imagine that adding random background can make the performance worse.\n\nTherefore, it is also unclear what to make of the numbers in e.g. Table 2. There are so many metrics, precision, recall, F1, and none of them seem particularly well justified. They also do not rank the model in the same way. Which result should a practitioner believe? \n\nConfidence: I am not sure the confidence vs. number of pixels comparison are useful. Across all methods, it seems to be more pixels -> increased confidence, which is unsurprising. I think the results are only useful if one method pareto dominates another, which is not what is observed in the experiments. \n\nI do not understand the difference between confidence and correctness. It seems like both measure how well a model can predict the correct class given only the salient region. For example, if method A has higher confidence and lower correctness compared to method B, what does that mean? Under which situation should one choose method A over method B? "}
