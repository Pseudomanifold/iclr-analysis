The authors generalise this effect to a larger class of problems where the learning framework induces a set of Hidden Incentive for Distributional Shift (HIDS) and introduce Context Swapping, a HIDS mitigation technique. In the experimental section, the authors propos a HIDS unit test which then they employ to show that PBT (Population Based-Trainng), a popular meta-learning algorithm exhibits HIDS ant that context swapping helps fixing it. \n\nOverall, I found the idea of the paper interesting, but the attempt to generalise the effect from meta-learning to general learning setups hard to follow and detracting from the overall value. I think the authors should have restricted their claims to PBT and PBT-like methods and follow-up with something more general in future work. \n\nFurthermore, the notation and formaliation of the problem are incomplete:\n    * the concept of \u2018trajectory\u2019 is introduced without being properly defined, though its crucial in the definition of the proposed HIDS mitigation approach\n    * the context swapping algorithm description is not clearly motivated and explained, a diagram showing the learner shuffling would be quite helpful\n    * in the HIDS unit-test section, the game theoretical setup is only partially explained, the defection and cooperation actions are not clearly linked to the HIDS \n    * In Section 4.1.1 HIDS UNIT TEST EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Figure2 is refered for results without ever stating the task and the Figure itself does not mention it\n\n       In terms of suggestions, I think the paper needs to go through a careful refactoring with an attention to technical details (careful concept definition, introduction of notation, clarity on experimental setup)\u2028"}
