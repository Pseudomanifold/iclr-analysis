They define the term along with the term hidden incentives for distributional shift. The latter describes factors that motivate the learner to change the distribution in order to achieve a higher performance. The authors study both phenomena in two domains (one being a prisoner dilemma and the other a recommender system) and show how meta-learning reveals the hidden incentives for distributional shift. They then propose an approach based on swapping learners between environments to reduce self introduced distributional shift.\n\nIn my opinion this paper should be (weak) rejected for several reasons.\n\n-\tThe paper is poorly written. Some sentences are hard to comprehend, even after repeated reading. It feels hastily written and should be carefully proofread with the help of a proficient English speaker.\n-\tThe very first paragraph is not a helpful example. While the authors provide an example that that illustrates a distributional shift, they don\u2019t describe what the shift is and why that shift in a negative consequence for learning. Therefore, the example is not helpful, but rather confusing.\n-\tIn point 3 of the contributions, the authors state \u2018that meta-learning reveals HIDS in these environments\u2019. Is this true for all meta-learning approaches? The current statement overclaims their findings. If the authors decide to keep it, they should provide a description of the types of meta-learning approaches that reveal HIDS and which don\u2019t or evaluate all different meta-learning approaches.\n-\tSection 4.1 is hard to follow. The authors state that the meta-learner is used to tune the learning rate \u2013 they fail to clearly explain how exactly the learning rate tuning results in a non-myopic behavior for a myopic learner.\n-\tIn the Q-learning example in Section 4.1, is the effect of \\epsilon considered? The discovery of non-myopic strategies might simply be based on chance. I would like the authors to include an investigation into the effect of this parameter.\n\nGenerally speaking, I appreciate the author\u2019s thoughts on SIDS and how they approach revealing hidden incentives. Although I vote to reject this paper, I strongly encourage the authors to rewrite the paper, address all other issues that are noted during this peer review and resubmit.\n"}
