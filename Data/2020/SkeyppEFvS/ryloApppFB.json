As also summarized by the paper, over recent years, there has been increasing interest in the research community for the study of visual reasoning, intuitive physics and perceptual causality. This work provides an interesting framework that combines all the three domains together to solve the problem of learning physical dynamics. The experimental result also shows promise. \n\n2. This paper also provides a nice work that bridges the gap between the counterfactual reasoning and deep learning community.\n\nWith all of this said, I think overall the paper is an interesting addition to the causal inference and deep learning literature."}
