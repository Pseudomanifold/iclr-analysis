The authors proposed a model that leverages object-centric scene representations and graph networks for modeling object interactions. The model also uses a recurrent network to encode and extract the confounder information for counterfactual prediction. In the experiments, the authors compared the proposed method, baselines, and human performance on pose estimation and counterfactual prediction.\n\nI reviewed an earlier version of the paper at another venue. Compared with that, the current manuscript has improved a lot. It's studying an important problem. The model builds upon SOTA techniques such as GCN. Experiments are conducted on multiple physical events with multiple confounders. There are also rich ablation studies. The writing is clear and easy to follow. My recommendation is weak accept.\n\nI think the paper can be improved by adding experiments on real data. The model involves 'de-rendering' which seems not easily generalizable to complex real scenes. Also, while the block tower scenario has been well studied, the discussion on ball and collision scenarios is quite limited. I encourage the authors to include more results on those datasets. The authors should also conduct human studies there, too.\n"}
