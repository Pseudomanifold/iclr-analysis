To address the problem, a federated adversarial domain adaption (FADA) algorithm is introduced in the paper. The key idea of the algorithm is to update the target model by aggregating the gradients from source nodes, and also leverage adversarial adaption techniques to reduce the discrepancy between source features and target features. Overall, the problem studied in the paper is interesting, theoretical analysis on the error bound is provided in the paper, and the effectiveness of the proposed method has been validated in various datasets. Although the technical contributions of the paper are solid, I still have several concerns about it.\n1. The proposed algorithm is not described very clearly in section 4. According to the paper, DI is used to identify the domain from the output of Gi and Gt and align the features from those domains, then how is it related to the disentanglement in Eq 6. Also in Eq 6, symbol C_s was not introduced in the previous context, which makes it confusing to understand this objective.\n\n2. It would be better if the author(s) can provide some complexity analysis of the proposed algorithm.\n\n3. The paper still contains some typos and unresolved reference issues. "}
