There is a novel analysis,\nsimulations, as well as some results on real data. The authors propose\nLyapunov-based safe RL algorithms that can handle\nproblems with large or infinite action spaces, and return safe\npolicies both during training and at\nconvergence. As far as I can tell the approach is novel, makes sense,\nand requires a lot of technical innovations. I was impressed with the\nmethod and the analysis behind the method. The incorporation of the\nLyapunov idea from control theory makes a great deal of sense in this\napplication. However, it is not trivial to get from using this tool to\na working method."}
