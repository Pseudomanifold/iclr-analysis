The proposed algorithm is more effective than existing self-supervised learning algorithm.  The presented results are encouraging.  \n1. In section 3.2,  the authors show that  a large number of views would improve the representation quality. However,  multi-views may provide redundancy information. What is the core information that affect  the representation quality?\n\nIn fact,  I am not an expert on self-supervised learning and  contrastive predictive coding,  so my reviewer confidence is low."}
