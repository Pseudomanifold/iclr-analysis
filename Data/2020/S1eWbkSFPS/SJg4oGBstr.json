For instance last paragraph in page 3, this should be clear already and should be restated.\n\nOne thing that is not clear is how does the model cope with the increase in feature dimensionality due to the concatenation over different steps. Isn\u2019t this leading to overfitting? Did the authors experiment with other schemes such as averaging or gating? If so it would be nice to see the results for each of the configurations as it is not clear to me what should be chosen a-priori.\n\nExperiments are nicely executed and the proposed approach is compared against a rich array of other models. Results are state-of-the-art and also the analysis of the model is interesting, i.e. it doesn\u2019t diverge when increasing # steps at test time.\nHow does the attention vector look like? Does it tend to peak at a given k, or is it more uniformly distributed? \n\nHow does the model compare to having k GAT layers, each constrained to use neighboring nodes at step k as input for the attention computation? Did the authors experiment on this?\n\nOverall I like the work but find the novelty quite limited, more effort could have been put into motivating the soundness of the use of multiple random walks. Perhaps some theory could be developed to make the paper stronger."}
