Previous works have used different measures of selectivity (with sometimes contradictory results), and the authors investigate the degree to which these units qualify as \u201cobject detectors\u201d.\n\nThis research area is important for understanding deep networks because claims have been made as to the relative importance (or lack thereof) of these individual units as identified by different measures vis-a-vis distributed representations -- the identification of such units would be interesting for understanding the predictions of classification networks.\n\nThe authors find that (1) different proposed measures of selectivity are not consistent and (2) units identified as selective cannot be considered object detectors due to the high false alarm / low hit rates, analyzing a large number of selectivity measures.  I would have liked to see experiments on more recent architectures (the focus of the paper is on a dated architecture (AlexNet)); there is analysis on units in GoogLeNet and VGG-16 but it would also be interesting to see results for more modern architectures (e.g. DenseNet and ResNet).\n\nOverall, I think that the authors have presented a strong meta-analysis and compelling argument for further study in rigorously identifying the presence (or lack thereof) of selective units in neural networks and the degree to which they may be considered \"object detectors.\""}
