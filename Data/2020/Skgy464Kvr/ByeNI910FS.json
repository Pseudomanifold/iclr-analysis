For both white-box and black-box settings, the proposed CapNets has shown superior performance than two variants of CNNs. The visualizations of adversarial examples generated by the CapNets are more aligned with the human perception which is very insightful. On the corrupted MNIST dataset, the results show the proposed defense method can also be used well as an out-of-distribution detector. Overall the paper is clearly written and easy to follow.\n\n\n\nHere I have some concerns:\n\nThe major one is the limited comparisons. For the defense of CNNs, the author only implemented two types of the strategy, which is derived from the characteristics of the capsule network. However, there are also other a lot of defense methods for CNNs which are designed according to the characteristics of themselves. I think the author should also compare the defense performance with those methods to hold the strong claims that CpasNets always perform better than convolutional networks. Also, the experiments performed on Cifar-10 is very limited.\n\n\n\nThe adversarial examples generated by the CapsNets shown in Figure 3 and Figure 11 are indeed changing the number shape which is aligned with human perception. However, some studies for CNNs has also found similar results on MNIST(Towards Deep Learning Models Resistant to Adversarial Attacks) and CIFAR-10(RANDOM MASK: Towards Robust Convolutional Neural Networks). The author should provide more visualizations on other datasets such as CIFAR-10 to support the contribution that the features captured by CapsNets are more aligned with human perception than CNNs.\n"}
