The explore this idea in the context of a game.\n\nHere is my main issue:\nAlthough I believe there is a value in studies like this. I am not sure ICLR is the right venue for it. The paper is well written but it reads like a long opinion/blog-post. There is no overarching theory or generalizable observation not to mention a solution. \nYes, I agree that the method of interpreting the black box has a lot of issues and the counterfactual approach/causal approach is probably the right way to go but this is hardly news to the community. \n\nIn short: what the generalizable contribution of the paper?\n\nI am open to change my mind if the discussion is convincing.
