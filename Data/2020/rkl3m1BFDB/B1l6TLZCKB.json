First, it is a survey on saliency maps used in explaining deep reinforcement learning models. Second, it is a proposal of a method that should overcome limitations of the current approaches described in the survey.\nThis double aim makes the paper hard to understand as the survey is not complete and the model is not well explained.\nThe main limitations the novel model aims to solve seems to be the production of \"falsifiable\" hypothesis in the explaination with saliency maps. However, experiments are really hard to follow and it is not clear why this is the case."}
