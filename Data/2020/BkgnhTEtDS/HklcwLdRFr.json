The paper laid out the necessary background knowledge very clear even for the audiences outside this area.\n\n2. The paper performed reasonable amount of experiments to compare the proposed model with various baseline models with various data sets, which are strong enough to support the claims made in this paper.\n\nComments:\n1. The theoretical innovation of this paper is trivial. The local detection model for feature interactions, i.e. MADEX is simply employing the previous work, LIME and NID. Its global extension, i.e. GLIDER and the proposed encoding method are straightforward. \n\n2. The descriptions on the feature dimensions of the original data and the generated binary representation data x\u2019 are rather confusing and inconsistent throughout the paper. If I understand it correctly, the data sample from the original feature space x \\in R^p, and a  binary representation x\u2019 \\in R^d, where d <= p. However, when d first appears in the first paragraph of section 3, it is defined as the dimension of the original feature space and later in that paragraph the dimension became p in \u201cf(.): R^p -> R\u201d. There is no clarification on the differences between d and p till section 4.1 where it states \u201cx \\in R^p \u201d. However, the dimension of the data instance from the original feature space changed to d again in section 4.2 where it states \u201cx =[x_1, x_2, \u2026, x_d]\u201d. \n\n3. \u201cWhat\u2019s more, the same approach to interpreting interactions can provide new insights into domains even beyond recommendation.\u201d should be \u201cWhat\u2019s more, the same approach to interpret interactions can provide new insights into domains even beyond the recommendation.\u201d\n\n4. \u201cAn interaction, I, is a subset of all input features...\u201d, but according to the following sections, I is the indices of a feature subset instead of the features themselves.\n \n5. \u201c...by requiring the same cross feature ID to occur more that T times in a batch of samples,...\u201d, \u2018that\u2019 should be \u2018than\u2019.\n\nOverall, although there is no significant theoretical innovation, it is a decent application paper.\n"}
