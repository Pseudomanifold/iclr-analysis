In contrast to the Gauge equivariant and Fourier approaches that have recently appeared, here the authors simply put a B-spline basis on local patches of the homogeneous space and move the basis elements around explicitly by applying the group action. \n\nThe approach is appealing in its simplicity and generality. No need to worry about irreducible representations and Fourier transforms, the formalism works for virtually any Lie group, no problem with non-compact groups. However, there is a constant need for interpolation. What is more more significant is that both the homogeneous space and the group need to be discretized and in general that cannot be done in a regular manner (no notion of a uniform grid on SO(3) for example). The authors assure us that \"we find that it is possible to find approximately uniform B-splines... e.g. by using a repulsion model\". I am not sure that it is so simple. This is one of those things where the idea is straightforward but the devil is in the details.\n\nTheorem 1 seems important but it is a bit cryptic. What is the statement \"a kernel satisfying such and such properties gives rise to an equivariant CNN\"? Or \"A CNN is equivariant if and only the kernel satisfies such and such properties\"?\n\nConcerningly, the paper is closely related to a few other papers using the spline CNN idea or at least the idea of taking a fixed set of functions and moving it around on the homogeneous space by acting on it with select group elements, most notably \"Roto-translational convolutional neural networks for medical image analysis\" by Bekkers et al.. The main difference of the present paper relative to that one is that the idea is fleshed out in a little more detail and is generalized from SE(2) to arbitrary Lie groups. However, conceptually there is little that is new.\n\nIn such a situation it would be important to present convincing experiments. Unfortunately in the present paper, results are only presented on 2 datasets, and the algorithm is basically only compared to different versions of itself, rather than state of the art competitors.\n\nThe paper is clearly written but the intuitive nature of the core ideas could be better conveyed e.g. by fancy diagrams."}
