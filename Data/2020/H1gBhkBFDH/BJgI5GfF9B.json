This lifts a significant limitation of such models which were previously confined to discrete or continuous compact groups due to tractability issues. \nI'm afraid that this paper is over my head. It relies heavily on field-specific terminology and as such is likely to be accessible to a relatively small subset of researchers. This looks to me like a solid contribution, however I'm really not qualified to judge."}
