This paper points out that GNN has limitations in reasoning about unsatisfiability of SAT problems possibly due to the simple message-passing scheme. To extend the GNN-based SAT solvers to 2-QBF solvers, this paper then turns to learn GNN-based heuristics that work with traditional decision procedure, and proposes a CEGAR-based 2QBF algorithm.\n\nOverall, the topic of combining logic reasoning and graph neural networks is interesting. But it is not clear how important is the targeted 2-QBF problem, except for testing and finding the limitations of GNN. In other words, this paper picks up a specific class of model for a very specific class of problem, which lacks sufficient and convincing motivations. Although GNN achieves success in solving SAT problems, it is not necessary that GNN is a must for solving the 2-QBF problems. Also, when analyzing the limitations of GNN, the paper makes conjecture only based on empirical results. It would be much more insightful to provide some theoretical analysis so that the paper can inspire other researchers working on different problems. Based on the above reasons, I would like to recommend a weak reject for this paper."}
