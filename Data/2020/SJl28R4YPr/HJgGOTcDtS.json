They show that similar GNN architectures which work for propositional logic do not transfer to 2-QBFs, and provide some explanation for the result. Finally, they show how GNN modules can be used to speed up existing 2-QBF solvers instead. I mostly like the paper. The claims of the paper are well presented and empirically validated. Here are some suggestions / complaints:\n\n1. It will be good to have more overview of 2-QBFs and existing solvers. How popular is CEGAR and why the improvements to its performance is important ?\n2. Dataset sizes are tiny compared to current standards. Is there a reason to use such small datasets ? From the results, I don't think any of the conclusions will change significantly from the dataset size, but still its better to use larger datasets.\n3. I think all tables should be self-explanatory. There are too many dataset splits and captions of tables do not provide any information. "}
