I think this is a completely reasonable area of study, but this paper cannot be accepted.  It gives no empirical or theoretical description of the benefits of this kind of function approximator in this setting over standard neural networks (or in any setting, really).  The only empirical results are images of the generations on MNIST and point clouds from some very simple 2-d distributions.  This is not much more than a white-boarding of an idea."}
