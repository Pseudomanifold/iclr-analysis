Given that the energy-efficiency is a critical need for modern machine learning tools, this is an important study in my opinion. Until now, most of the spiking neuron based works don't really apply for realistic deep model learning. Therefore, advancements such as these would be very useful. \n\nHowever, my biggest concern is that the paper may be a bit difficult to grasp for the general ML audience. I myself am not an expert in this topic and had quite a bit of difficulty as an ML researcher in understanding parts of the paper. As a matter of fact, some of the supplementary material was quite helpful to understand the entire context. So, I suggest to move some of the basics from there to the main paper. Also, some of the performance comparison results in the supplementary section are more convincing and clear compared to the results in the main paper. \n\nBased on my understanding, the algorithmic approach seems logical and the empirical results are convincing. However, I am not in a position to assess the level of novelty. So, I am giving the benefit of the doubt to the authors, given that this is a critical topic for the ML community.   "}
