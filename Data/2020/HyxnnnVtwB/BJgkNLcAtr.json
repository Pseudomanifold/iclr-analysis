The authors need to introduce a complex rescaling of the time step, repercussion on the computation. This point should be shown experimentally. The authors introduced a modification of the aI&F and are applying low pass filtering the spike trains. \n\nAs all the results are obtained on a python simulator, it is difficult to assess the interest and the applicability to real neuromorphic chips.\nAs pointed out by the authors, the main interest of these architectures are the lower energy consumption than CPU/GPU-based architecture.\nUnfortunately, it is not possible to assess if the proposed neuron model is working on energy efficient architecture.\n\n\n[1] Nair, M.
