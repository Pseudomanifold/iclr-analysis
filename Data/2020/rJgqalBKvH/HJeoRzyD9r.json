The paper reviews previous literature and outlines a model, but it seems to be at the draft stage as it stands as the experiment section is missing (section 4). Also, in some parts the sentences are broken and hard to follow, for example, \u201cHere we formulate the stochastic goal recognition control (S-GRC) problem as an extension of the GRD problem to allows non-optimal agents and stochastic actions, which means the agent\u2019s action are not deterministic and the possible successor states are with probability, the measures we can take are interdictions with cost.\u201d\nBased on the above comments I think the paper is not ready for publication.\n"}
