The problem has been studied in the security game, resource allocation game and Stackelberg game, where the defender is to play a resource allocation game given the best response of the attacker. in this paper, the authors use stochastic-shortest-path MDP to model the attacker's planning problem. The defender's objective is stated in eq (2) and (3) but not explained clearly.\n\nThe work considers a deceptive attacker whose objective is not to maximize the total reward/minimize the total cost, but rather to balance two objectives: minimizing the total cost while maximizing the KL divergence between its current policy and the optimal goal-achieving policy. This opponent model seems to be simplistic, given security game has studied the opponent using more rigorous equilibrium analysis and with dynamic Bayesian game formulation. \n\nsee Manshaei, Mohammad Hossein, et al. \"Game theory meets network security and privacy.\" ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR) 45.3 (2013): 25.\n\nThe practical application is well motivated. \u2028The paper itself is incomplete and contains many typos.
