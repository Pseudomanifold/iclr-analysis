These failures usually prevent convergence of training neural network models. Focusing on the asynchronous SGD algorithm implemented with a parameter-server, the authors propose to use stochastic line search ideas to detect whether the gradients are good descent directions or not. It applies to a general scenario including repeated and unbounded Byzantine failures. \n\nTheoretical results of this paper seem to me to have some flaw. In the proof of Theorem 1, line 6, it is not clear to me why the gradient norm ||g||^2 is replaced by || grad f_s (x_tau) ||^2. Clearly the g comes from any worker which can be very different to grad f_s (x_tau). Therefore, I recommend the authors check the proof of both theorem 1 and 2 more carefully.\n\nNumerical results show that the proposed algorithm Zeno++ works well with sign-flipping attacks. However, this scenario is very limited to validate all imaginable Byzantine failures that this paper would like to address. For example, one can use random gradients instead of sign-flipped gradients as a Byzantine attack, would the algorithm still work? \n"}
