The authors use a hinge surrogate loss with smoothing to make the certification differentiable and optimize it, getting results that are on par with Salmans et al.\n\nDetailed remarks:\n - From table 3 it seems like MACER was trained for more then the other models, up to almost x3 times more on cifar. This makes the comparison unfair and puts the results into question.\n- It was nice that the authors gave a theoretical guarantee for the soft-RS, but it is not clear if that is needed. You can train with soft-RS and apply the hard-RS at test time which has the standard guarantees\n- Fig. 3 needs labels on x&y axis\n-  The ablation study isn't really an ablation study, it is more testing the sensitivity of various parameters (which is good in itself). However the gamma results and claims are hard to see from the plot.\n\n"}
