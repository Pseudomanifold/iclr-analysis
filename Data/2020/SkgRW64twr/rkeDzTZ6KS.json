In order to make the paper more accessible to a general audience, the authors should:\n1) have at least one sentence in the abstract that explains in layman terms why is CCA important and how it works (\"multi-view learning\" does not suffice); given that you have the term \"multi-view learning\" in the title, you should explain what it is and how it can benefit from CCA\n2)  re-organize the current intro, which reads more like related work, into a more traditional format\n     - one intuitive paragraph on what is multi-view learning (MVL), what is CCA, how does CCA help MVL \n     - one intuitive paragraph on an illustrative example on how MVL & CCA help solving a problem\n     - one intuitive paragraph on how the proposed approach works\n     - one paragraph summarizing the main findings/results \n3) ideally, add a section with an illustrative running example, which would have a huge impact on the paper's readability (far more than, say, than the current Appendix) "}
