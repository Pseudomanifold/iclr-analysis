Each entity (or relation) is associated with a distribution over the entities (or relations) in the other KG through an exponential kernel-density-like-estimate. \n\n\nThe main contribution seems to be the use of GAN to generate good negative triplets instead of the traditional search-for-hard-negatives in constrained problems. This is a novel contribution and I see the value of this line of work.\n\nThe reason why I am tending not to accept this work is because it very similar(/same) to existing work like KBGAN (https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N18-1133/). Most of the key ideas have already been covered there, and I would like to see a comparison of this work with that before acceptance.\n\n\nnits: \nsome column names in the table are inconsistent - hit vs h, mrr vs mr.\n"}
