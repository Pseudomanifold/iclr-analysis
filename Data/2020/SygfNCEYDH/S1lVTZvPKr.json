For this they use a discriminator that functions as an adversary to the parameterized triple alignment function leading to adversarial training. Furthermore, they regularize the training by maximizing a neural mutual information estimator. This requires training another approximating neural network along the way.\nSeveral experiments seem to indicate that their approach improves over competing methods in the unsupervised and weakly-supervised setting."}
