As the authors\nclearly state, the techniques used are not novel (they have been used\nin neuroscience) but the results are interesting.\n\nOne interesting aspect is that the classification image technique is\nquite good (better than the average gradient of the classification\nloss with respect to the image) at revealing trojan (adversarial\npatch) networks - networks trained with trojan patches that change the\nclassified class of the image - (and the area of the trojan attack).\nHow long does it take (and with what hardware) to create the\nclassification images for the trojan networks?\n\nThe authors also show how the method can be used for black-box adversarial\nattacks without need for gradients or logits and model microstimulation\nexperiments.\n\nI don't feel there is quite enough insights here for ICLR publication.\n"}
