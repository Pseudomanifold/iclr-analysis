The first tool is classification images and the second, spike-triggered analysis.\n\nThe broad goal of the paper is to add more tooling to add interpretability and robustness to a neural network.\n\nClassification images can be summarized as: Produce a stimulus from the sum of a signal image and a noise image. Then average the response over many trials to determine what template the network used.\n\nSpike-triggered analysis can be understood as measuring a neuron's response to time-varying stimuli (ie: neuron responding to a line) which scopes out the receptive field.\n\nThe paper is well written. Experimentation section is thorough. The related work is well discussed.\nThe overall techniques are interesting and can help the community think about interpretability by using tools from related disciplines.\n\nDecision:\nAccept\n\nReasoning:\nInterpretability is a very important problem and the authors present ways of thinking about it from the lens of computational neuroscience. This paper has the potential to inspire future research in this direction.\n\n\n\n"}
