MGLM can be used for both conditional generation (e.g., machine translation) and unconditional sampling. In the experiments, MGLM uses the Multi30k dataset where multiple high quality channels are available, in the form of multilingual translations.\n\nI feel that this paper is not ready for publication at ICLR due to the following major issues:\n\n* Missing important related work: This paper seems unaware of an important related work \"Multi-Task Learning for Multiple Language Translation\" by Dong et al, ACL 2015. In fact, Dong et al. investigated the problem of learning a machine translation model that can simultaneously translate sentences from one source language to multiple target languages. Although machine translation is just an example of MGLM, Dong et al. is highly relevant to the conditional generation with MGLM, needless to say that they share the same multi-language translation problem domain. Thus, this paper will be much stronger if comparison with important baseline methods is provided.\n\n* Limited novelty: This paper extends Chan et al.'s KERMIT by applying its objective on tasks with more than 2 sequences, in order to learn the joint distribution p(channel_1, ..., channel_k) over k channel sequences. Most of the math in this paper can be found in the original Chan et al.'s paper. The extension to the multichannel case is incremental as it is hard to justify the challenge of such extensions.\n\nBesides, as minor suggestions, it would help readers if more illustrations of Figure 1 (especially the inference part) can be provided."}
