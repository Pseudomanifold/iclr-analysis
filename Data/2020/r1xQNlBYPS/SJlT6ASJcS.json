In particular, the submission describes construction of multi-view language models that (i) can generate text simultaneously in multiple languages, (ii) can generate text in one or more languages conditioned on text from another language. This submission extends previously proposed KERMIT from two views to more than two views. I believe this paper could be of interest to multi-view modelling/learning community. \n\nThough the original KERMIT approach is very interesting and you application of it to more than two views is also interesting I find the presentation to be poor. In particular I find section 2 to be hard if not impossible to understand without referring to the original paper where the story, equations, nomenclature are much more clearly explained. Even though your extension from two views to multiple is simple I find reliance on a diagram to be a mistake as I find your description not to be very clear. Given that there are no equations to support the reader and that the original equations are not adequate I find it hard to understand Sections 2 and 3. The key experimental result in Table 1 is only briefly commented on despite featuring multiple models with different strength and weaknesses, multiple types of inference. If space is of concern I would suggest removing Figure 2 (or changing input from non-English to English and removing or removing another qualitative table).\n"}
