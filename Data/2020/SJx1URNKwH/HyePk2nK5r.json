The overall pipeline is built by applying  meta-learning strategy on pre-trained retargeting module. It follows a conditional generator and discriminator structure that leverages few-shot frames to retarget the action of source video. The approach is technically sound.\n\nThe evaluations are compared with two baseline methods,  Pix2PixHD and Posewarp. Their evaluations are satisfactory and convincing, the results demonstrate some improvements over baseline models regarding both the selected metrics and the visualizing performance.\n\nThough the proposed problem is novel and somewhat interesting, there are also several weaknesses of this work:\n- The novelty of methodology is somewhat limited. It is more about merging several state-of-the-art modules in different tasks to tackle the few-shot retargeting problem. Though efforts may be needed to make the pipeline work, the overall contribution is not significant. \n- The improvement obtained with proposed MetaPix module is not significant in few-shot setting according to Table 1. Additionally, could the authors provide some visualizing results for different K number, which would be interesting for analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
