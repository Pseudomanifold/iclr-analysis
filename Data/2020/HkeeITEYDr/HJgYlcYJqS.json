They approach this by assuming the transition function may vary between elements of the domain distribution and extend some recent results (Blanchet & Murthy, 2019) to give some theoretical results (contraction and optimal deterministic policy) and an actor-critic algorithm. This is an important research area and the work takes a very nice approach. However, the clarity of the work and the empirical results could both use some work.\n\nThere are a great many grammatical errors throughout the paper. The nature of the errors suggests a non-native speaker, which I really do not want to discourage, but this needs a proofread and edit. One exception, there is an actual typo just after assumption 1 \u201cdfnied\u201d, but actually better grammatically to just remove the word entirely.\n\nIn the intro, the citation of Mannor et al. 2004; 2007 for what is essentially a description of the gap between simulation to real transfer is a very strange choice. Is it possible this was a mistake?\n\nThe description leading up to the main result could be made much clearer. I went through this section, the main results, and the proofs in the appendix. Things look good, although I do feel like (as just said) it could be made much better/clearer. One snag I hit was in the proof of Lemma 1, everything is good except I don\u2019t know why \u201cu_1 \\le u_2 + \\gamma \\| u_1 - u_2 \\|_\\infty\u201d must hold, but I might have simply missed something obvious so please help me out.\n\nThe experimental results are very minimal and not very convincing. It is not immediately clear to me that Figures 1&2 actually show that the robustac algorithm is more robust than ac. The performance is worse than ac, which is completely understandable, but for most of the environments ac is still significantly better.\n\nLastly, a small point to notice that this paper bleeds into the 9th page, and considering the amount of contributions (largely down to the two theoretical results and a very small experiment) I do not think the extra space is warranted. This could be compressed and actually come out stronger as a result of being forced to be clearer and more concise.\n"}
