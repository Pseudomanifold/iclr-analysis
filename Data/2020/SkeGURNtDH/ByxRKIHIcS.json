It seems to be implemented using a combination of existing techniques such as CNNs and generalized mean pooling. The model has to linear heads to do classification and image retrieval. The authors obtain new state of the art results on classification when compared to previous results obtained with similar architectures.\n\nNovelty:\n\nI believe this is the main limitation of this work. It seems the proposed method does not have significant innovations and it is obtained from combining previous methodologies.\n\nQuality and significance:\n\nThe experiments seem to indicate that the proposed method could be useful in practice. However, the lack of new methodological contributions reduces the quality and significance of this work.\n\nClarity:\n\nThe paper seems to be clearly written and is easy to read."}
