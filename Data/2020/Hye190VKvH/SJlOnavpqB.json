It is out of the area of my expertise, but the innovation of combining the PCA and LPP to produce the dimensionally reduced representation of the longitudinal data seems not significant enough, especially when the author did not mention why they chose these two methods out of all the available projection/hashing approaches.\n\n2. The paper is poorly written. Theorem 1 and Theorem 4 state the opposite conditions for v. Theorem  2 and Theorem 5 are exactly the same. If the same theorem has already been proved by previous work [Wang et al., 2014], it is not necessary to prove it again in this paper. The most important theorem which is claimed as the theoretical contribution of this paper (i.e. Theorem 6) did not even appear in the main contents but only in the appendix. The proof of theorems in appendix, Proof A.1, A.2, A.3 did not state which theorem they are corresponding to and are organized in different order as Theorem 3-5, make it hard to read.\n\n3. There are many grammar errors and sentences which are not consistent with English writing conventions. E.g. \u201cThis problem is heavily studied with (Wang et al., 2012; Brand et al., 2018; Lu et al., 2018) as example approaches which, despite their effectiveness, present an added complexity to the problem.\u201d is better written as \u201cThis problem is excessively studied by (Wang et al., 2012; Brand et al., 2018; Lu et al., 2018) as example approaches which, despite their effectiveness, present an additional complexity to the problem\u201d; \u201c... to provide value in predicting patients\u2019 diagnosis.\u201d is better written as \u201c... to provide valuable information in ...\u201d; \u201c... , we focus AD diagnosis from MRI scans ...\u201d should be \u201c... , we focus on AD diagnosis from MRI scans ...\u201d; \u201cconsider outliers\u201d is better as \u201chandle outliers\u201d; etc. \n\n4. In the sentence below equation (5), \u201cJ_LPP/J_LPP\u201d should be \u201cJ_LPP/J_PCA\u201d. \n"}
