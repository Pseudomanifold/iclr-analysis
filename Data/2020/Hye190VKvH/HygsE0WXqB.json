The balance between these two components is modulated by a hyperparameter alfa. The authors proposed a method to overcome the issue of a direct computation of alfa. The main contribution of this work is to prove that a quotient formulation between LPP and PCA is equivalent to a weighted difference of these two terms.\n\nIt is not straightforward to understand whether the proposed method is effective in reducing the time consuming effort required by the computation of alfa hyperparameter, as stated in the premises as motivation of this work.\n\nThe presentation of theorems is misleading. Theorems 1 and 4 seem to claim opposite statements, while theorems 2 and 5 have the same claim.\n\nMinor comments.\nAfter equation 5 there is a typos in the ratio LPP/LPP.\n"}
