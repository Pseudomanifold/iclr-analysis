This is also out of domain for me and I am not a useful reviewer for this paper.\n\nAs a general comment, I will say that the paper adopts a highly mathematical style that will be off putting to many readers.  Many of the expressions are 'high entropy'  For instance, the embedding network is given as $\\mathbf{\\Psi}_{\\theta_1}$ throughout.  This is seven levels of typographical distinction for the main character of the story.  This is a (1) bold (2) capital (3) Greek letter with a (4) subscript that is (5) greek with a (6) subscript that is (7) numeric.  I understand that each of these levels of distinction has a purpose and a meaning, but it is also arguably a much richer designation that is necessary.  Generally the paper feels like this, as if its being too unnecessarily specific.  Personally I found the paper rather difficult to read and decompose, which I believe does count against the paper.  The overly specific nature of paper will cut into its potential readership strongly."}
