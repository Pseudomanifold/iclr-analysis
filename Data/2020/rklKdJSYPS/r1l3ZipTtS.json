The key idea is to interpolate between a real example $x_i$ and an adversarial example $x_j^{(adv)}$ and use the interpolation between soft labels from the EMA model as the virtual target. They give an intuitive explanation of crafting more aggressive adversarial examples as verified in Figure 3. The authors evaluate AdvMixup on both synthetic data and widely-used benchmarks. AdvMixup outperforms previous baselines. An ablation study and discussion are also provided.\n\nThe paper is clear and easy to follow. The proposed method is very simple and straightforward given the literature. However,  it is hard to say this is novel enough for ICLR since it looks like a combination of existing techniques. The novelty is my main concern.\n\nAnd I wonder whether it is better to generate stronger adversarial examples. It would be more insightful if the authors consider more attack methods than the one-step approach and see whether there is a trade-off.\n\nHow about the performance of AdvMixup when the classes are larger, e.g. CIFAR-100 and ImageNet?\n"}
