It addresses a problem posed for existing methods for characterizing saliency in activation subject to sanity checks which measure the degree to which the activation (saliency) map changes subject to different randomization tests.\nThe proposed solution involves a simple competition mechanism across saliency maps produced when different logits are considered such that small values are zeroed out in favor of larger values across the logits.\nOverall, I find this paper to be interesting and to address a problem worthy of further consideration. While the mechanism for competition is very simple, the resulting activation maps subject to randomization tests are reasonably convincing.\nIn the ideal case, I would have liked to see different strategies for eliciting competition explored to determine their relative merits. Nevertheless, I expect that such work will follow with this being an initial step in this direction."}
