The main techniques behind the non-recursive model is similar to that of the ICLR 2018 paper \"NON-AUTOREGRESSIVE NEURAL MACHINE TRANSLATION\". Unfortunately, as state tacking can be formulated as one special case of sequence decoding, there is not much of innovation that can be claimed in this paper considering the \"fertility\" idea was already been proposed. The paper did illustrate a strong experimental results on a recent dataset comparing with many state-of-the-art models. However, it is not clear how much innovation this work generates and how the ICLR community would benefit from the problem that the paper is addressing.  \n\n "}
