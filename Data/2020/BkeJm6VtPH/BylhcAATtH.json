Generally, there are two group of methods. And, the proposed method called CLNP leverages the merits from both of them. The experimental results clearly shows the effectiveness of this method.\n\nMy main concern is that this paper actually was accepted by a Neuro AI workshop of NeurIPS and thus this submission does not comply the rules of double-blind review process. Anyway, overall, this paper is well-written and interesting.\n\nI have more following concerns\n1) As the review given by Neuro AI, the submission just compare their results to Zenke et al. 2017 for SPLIT CIFAR-10/CIFAR-100. In this version, authors does not add new experiments to compare some new methods. Actually, most concerns raised by the reviewers in Neuro AI have not been considered.\n2) It is not clear how to set the hyperparameter such as threshold \\theta in different layers. Most settings and criteria are given empirically and this paper seriously lacks theoretical analysis.\n"}
