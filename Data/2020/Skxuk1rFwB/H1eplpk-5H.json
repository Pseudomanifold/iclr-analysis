It uses a CROWN-based bound in the warm up phase of IBP, which serves as a better initialization for the later phase of IBP and lead to improvements in both robust and standard accuracy. The CROWN-based bound uses IBP to compute bounds for intermediate pre-activations and applies CROWN only to computing the bounds of the margins, which has a complexity between IBP and CROWN. The experimental results are verify detailed to demonstrate the improvement.\n\nThe improvement is significant enough to me and I tend to accept the paper. The results on CIFAR10 with epsilon=8/255 is so far the state-of-the-art. However, it is far from being scalable enough to large networks and datasets, which has already been achieved by randomized smoothing based approaches. On CIFAR10, it takes 32 TPU cores to train a 4-conv-layer network. Still, such an approach has the advantage of making robust inferences much more efficiently than randomized smoothing, and thus still worth further explorations."}
