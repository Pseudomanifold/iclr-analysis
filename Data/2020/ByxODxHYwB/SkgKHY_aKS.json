The underlying idea is that topic models contain a global view that differs on a thematic level, while word embeddings contain a local, immediate contextual view. The combination of both local and global view transfer to enhance a topic model is the main contribution of this paper, especially when using multiple sources (therefore the title: multi-source multi-view transfer).\nGiven a document collection, DocNADE is used to generate the topic-word matrix. In the local view transfer step, the pre-trained WordPool is used, from which knowledge is transferred on the target document. The global view transfer is done by transferring knowledge from the pre-trained TopicPool to the target. As described in Algorithm 1 in the paper, both Word- and TopicPool are jointly used in the transfer learning process. \nFor evaluation, three different measures are taken into account: Perplexity, Topic Coherence and Precision (Information Retrieval). In comparison to a DocNADE only approach, all values are better in the settings that use the transfer learning approach. Compared to DocNADE + word embeddings, the results are competitive as well. In both experiments, the multi-source setting evaluates best overall.\n\nIn conclusion, the paper shows that exploiting multiple sources and views in transfer learning leads to an overall improvement in the given tasks. The main contribution is the usage topic models in a transfer learning framework. Additionally the use of multi-source word embeddings is novel too, especially in the joint setting with the topic model transfer. The paper shows how the DocNADE approach is enhanced to make use of both local and global view transfer and how this enhancement leads to improved performance on various related tasks. \nStill, the overall contribution is mostly in combining existing methods and can be judged as rather incremental.\n\nMinor note: A small mistake has been found in Table 5. The best perplexity value in the first column is not the bold 638, but the 630 in the local-view transfer setting.\n"}
