Based on this result, one could construct embedding models that naturally accommodate all possible local graph patterns, and the paper also shows a few simulations.\n\nMy main concern is that, while the focus on this work is the theoretical finding, there is no rigorous statement of it as a theorem. As a result, I am not exactly sure what the proofs in the appendix is trying to show. In addition, the proofs seems to be very trivial.\n\nFor the algorithm section, I feel that it is also lacking in the sense that there is still no automatic way to choose which group to embed. It is also unclear what is the purpose of the simulation section. While it says \"As theoretically analyzed in Section 3.2, and empirically shown above, continuous nonabelian groups are more reasonable choices for general tasks\", the advantage of continuous nonabelian groups are not so significant in the tables.
