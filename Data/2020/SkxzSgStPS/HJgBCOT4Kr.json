To the best of my knowledge, this was the first paper proposed to use moving patterns in two consecutive observations to motivate agent exploration.\n\nBalanced view: \n- The authors discussed both the advantages of FICM and settings that FICM might fail to perform well, and conducted experiments to better help the readers understand such nuances. Such balanced view should be valuable to RL communities in both academia and industry.\n\nClarity:  \n- In general this was a very well-written paper, I had no difficulty in following the paper throughout. The proposed method (FICM) was clearly motivated, and the authors provided good coverage of related works. Notably, the authors reviewed two relevant methods upon which FICM was motivated, which made the paper self-contained.\n\n\nCons\nExperiments:\n- Experiments were conducted only using a few recent results as baselines (ICM, forward dynamics, RND). It would be interesting to compare FICM against simpler exploration baselines such as epsilon-greedy or entropy regularization.\n- I\u2019d also like to see more extensive comparisons between FICM and ICM across different datasets, for example, Super Mario Bros. and the Atari games, instead of only comparing FICM against ICM on ViZDoom.\n\nSignificance of the innovation: \n- The proposed exploration method seemed to be applicable with a particular RL setting: the environment changes could be represented through consecutive frames (e.g., video games), and optical flow could be used to interpret any object displacements in such consecutive frames. And as the authors discussed, even under such constraints the applicability of proposed method depends on how much changes of the environment were relevant to the goal.\n\nReproducibility:\n- Although the authors discussed the experiment setting in detail in supplements, I believe open-sourcing the code / software used to conduct the experiments would be greatly help with the reproducibility of the proposed method for researchers or practitioners.\n\n\n\n\nSummary\nA good paper overall, but the experiments were relatively weak (common for most ICLR submissions) and the novelty was somewhat limited.\n\n"}
