The idea is new (to me) and appears both elegant and effective. The approach provides a fast way to repair models that have been attacked. \n\nMore broadly, mode connectivity provides a powerful window into adversarial robustness and model choice. It constructs approximately optimal paths between models, where the path depends on a choice of loss. It thus allows to investigate how various models relate to each other from the perspective of various losses. The paper barely scratches the surface of this approach. \n\nComments:\nThe claim that all models on paths have similar test losses (bottom p8) seems a bit of a stretch given the bottom panels (middle and right) of Figure 4.\nThe paper is difficult to read; it somehow feels quite disjointed.\nProposition 1 is difficult to parse.\n"}
