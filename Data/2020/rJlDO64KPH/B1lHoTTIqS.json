This is a worthy goal. The details of the proposal were a bit hard for me to understand. The proposed method reminded me of \"posterior regularization\" (K. Ganchev et al. 2010), but I could not understand Section 2.2 well enough to draw a direct link. I encourage the authors to condense 2.2 and make it clearer what, exactly, Local Prior Matching is.\n\nThe paper presents extensive, interesting results. I do want to point that they seem to be considerably off of the LibriSpeech state of the art, e.g. see K. Irie et al. Interspeech 2019."}
