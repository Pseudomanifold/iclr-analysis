The authors claim that the new design is able to lower the energy consumption in the matrix multiplication. In the experimental analysis, the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\nThis paper should be rejected since it proposes exactly the same architecture with the following published work:\nBitBlade: Area and Energy-Efficient Precision-Scalable Neural Network Accelerator with Bitwise Summation\n\nAlso, the authors do not provide a valid approach for the auto-selection of quantization bits, which is more significant in my opinion."}
