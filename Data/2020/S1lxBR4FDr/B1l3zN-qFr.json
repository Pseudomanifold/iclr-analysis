Then it proposes the SADS method to improve the robustness of the single-step adversarial training by adding the dropout mechanism. The evaluation in the experiments is appropriate and reasonable.\n\nHowever, the critical point that prevents me from accepting this paper is that there is a severe degradation on clean accuracy when applying SADS. For example, in Table 3, the clean accuracy of SADS on CIFAR-10 is only 75%. So I doubt that if SADS can scale to a larger dataset like ImageNet, since the degradation on the clean accuracy may be more serious.\n\n\n"}
