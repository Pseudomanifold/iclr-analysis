These are compared against many state-of-the-art approaches including cross-encoders and bi-encoders on many large-scale datasets. \nBi-encoders > Poly-encoders > Cross-encoders in terms of speed and \nCross-encoders > Poly-encoders > Bi-encoders in terms of accuracy.\n\nI am not an expert in this area. However, to the best of my knowledge I don't see anything immediately wrong with this. The experiments are also comprehensive. Therefore I recommend acceptance."}
