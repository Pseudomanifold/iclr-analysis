The paper describes two main existing approaches for this task, namely bi-encoders and cross-encoders and then proposes a new formulation called poly-encoders which aims to sit between the existing approaches offering high accuracy -- similarly to cross-encoders -- and high efficiency -- similarly to bi-encoders. The paper is well written and although this is not related to my research I enjoying reading it. The approach proposed seems reasonable to me, and of sufficient novelty while the results presented are impressive. Moreover the paper seems a good fit for ICLR."}
