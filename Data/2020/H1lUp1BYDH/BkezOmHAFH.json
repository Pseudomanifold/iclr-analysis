Agents in the network can communicate with their neighbors to share their local observations which leads to overall better performance in partially observable scenarios. The paper then shows results on SUMO traffic simulator which suggest that networks with communication outperform the ones without it. The paper further shows that in these networks individual groups emerge which coordinate with each other to achieve a common goal.\n\nThe paper hasn\u2019t been situated properly with respect to prior work. Similar concepts have been tested in Graph Attention Networks [1], Interaction Networks [6] and VAIN [2] papers. In [1], the value of each network is attended sum of neighbors\u2019 hidden state. The networks based on continuous communication can be easily converted to discrete ones through Gumbel Softmax. So, due to concerns around novelty and limited experiments only on traffic junction with some critical details missing, I would give initial rating of reject. I post my other concerns and feedback below:\n\nPaper claims Sukhbaatar et. al. 2017 [3] as concurrent work which was published in 2017. [1] has further two derivative works Singh et. al. 2018 [4] and Das et. al. 2017 [5] which need to be compared against as well. On the difference from [3] as mentioned in the paper, in [3, 4, 5], (i) agents can be easily converted to be traffic lights instead of cars. (ii) continuous communication can be converted into discrete using Gumbel Softmax (iii) every agent can communicate to every other agent. The paper essentially contributes results on what happens when the agents are in network topology instead of open communication so (iii) point needs to be framed better. It would be interesting and informative to see how the paper\u2019s model compare against [3, 4, 5] in open communication setting (it may be an upper bound). As mentioned above, proper differences from [1] and [2] also need to be mentioned.\n\nPaper is also missing experiments on scalability of this approach. Does the approach scale well as agents in the network increase? It would be helpful to know (i) the generalization of this approach by testing on different configuration at test time (ii) if the approach works well on task other than traffic control like network packet routing (iii) How well the approach scales as the number of agents increase.\n\nWhat is the value of beta used for reward function? And paper doesn\u2019t comment on how does the performance get affected by value beta as it goes from 0 (individual rewards) [4] to 1 (global rewards) [3]. Also, what is the composition of the factors mentioned in reward structure at page 5. Having the exact equation in paper would be helpful.\n\n\nIf the paper can provide the following details, it would help on its readability and my understanding. \n(i) For easily comparing different baseline, a table should be added with the final rewards.\n(ii) What are the architectural details of the CNN used in image encoder and the RNN used in accumulator. What are the values of other hyperparameters?\n(iii) How exactly the model has been trained? \n(iv) Why does 1 blind agent network converges faster and higher initially even though there is a missing observation?\n(v) The paper claims at many points that global rewards help but have they tried with individual rewards? As [4] suggest, individual rewards converge faster and higher than global rewards it might be worth exploring this.\n\n[1] Veli\u010dkovi\u0107, Petar, Guillem Cucurull, Arantxa Casanova, Adriana Romero, Pietro Lio, and Yoshua Bengio. \"Graph attention networks.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1710.10903 (2017).\n[2] Hoshen, Yedid. \"Vain: Attentional multi-agent predictive modeling.\" In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 2701-2711. 2017.\n[3] Sukhbaatar, Sainbayar, and Rob Fergus. \"Learning multiagent communication with backpropagation.\" In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 2244-2252. 2016.\n[4] Singh, Amanpreet, Tushar Jain, and Sainbayar Sukhbaatar. \"Learning when to communicate at scale in multiagent cooperative and competitive tasks.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1812.09755 (2018).\n[5] Das, Abhishek, Th\u00e9ophile Gervet, Joshua Romoff, Dhruv Batra, Devi Parikh, Michael Rabbat, and Joelle Pineau. \"Tarmac: Targeted multi-agent communication.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1810.11187 (2018).\n[6] Battaglia, Peter, Razvan Pascanu, Matthew Lai, and Danilo Jimenez Rezende. \"Interaction networks for learning about objects, relations and physics.\" In Advances in neural information processing systems, pp. 4502-4510. 2016.\n"}
