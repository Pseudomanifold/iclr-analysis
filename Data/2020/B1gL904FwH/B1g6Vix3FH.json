Specifically, it adopts the idea of collective matrix factorization to factorize the data representation matrix and the node similarity matrix into a common space. Experiments on real-world datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed method. \n\nIn general, the studied problem of simultaneous embedding and clustering is interesting and is seldom studied in literature. However, the technical contributions of the paper is rather limited. Please see the detailed comments below:\n1. The node proximity w.r.t. network topology and attributes may not align with each other, thus simply adding their similarity together (Eq.(1)) is a very rudimentary way to combine these two data sources.\n2. The idea of collective factorization (Eq.(3)) is not novel and lacks detailed justification.\n3. The time complexity of the matrix factorization based framework is very high, making it difficult to be scaled to large-scale networks. And also, the used datasets in the experiments are very small, making the derived conclusions not convincing. "}
