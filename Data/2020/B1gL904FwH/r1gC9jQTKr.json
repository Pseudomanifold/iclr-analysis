This is achieved by designing an objective function that involves matrices with different meanings. The optimization problem is then solved in an alternating direction way, which only optimizes one variable, while having the others fixed. The optimization algorithm is intuitive and involves matrix factorization heavily.\n\n\nThe objective function is not explained well. I cannot see why you design it in this way and is not convinced that it is better than the others. The proposed algorithm to solve the optimization algorithm is very intuitive and is computationally expensive, involving many SVD operations in each step. Its scalability is in doubt. \n\nThe motivation to combine the two tasks of embedding and clustering is not clear. I cannot see why combining the two task is important.\n\nThe paper is organized and written very poorly. It is difficult to follow.\n\nMore relevant baseline models of attitude network embedding using deep learning methods should be taken into account.\n\n"}
