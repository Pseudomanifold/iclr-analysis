The paper is theoretical sound and provides interesting point of view to handle the distributional optimization problem. It also provides some numerical simulation to support the theory.\n\nWhile the method itself is interesting, the main concern to accept this paper is that it does not show enough connection to machine learning community. The whole paper spend a lots of space to do the mathematical derivation, but does not draw connection to a specific type of machine learning problem they want to solve. The only example it mentioned is in the introduction of portfolio management, which seems to be more important problem in operation research community. To be accepted as a machine learning conference paper, I think the paper should apply this fundamental statistical optimization problem into a machine learning problem, such as adversarial learning.\n\nMinor mistake:\n1. Abstraction line 9, the period '.' should be replace by a comma ','.\n2. In problem setting, the line 3 of paragraph of $\\phi-$divergence, there is typo on $0\\phi(\\frac{0}{0})$ and $\\phi(\\frac{a}{0})$, which does not make sense in the context.\n\nIn sum, I think the paper should be rejected unless it makes more connection to machine learning community."}
