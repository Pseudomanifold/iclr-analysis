The authors show relations between these two problems for strategies with and without boundedness through a thorough theoretical analysis. They furthermore validate their insights in synthetic and real-data experiments. \n \nThe paper appears sound and solid to me -- to the extend I can assess this. I have doubts on the  relevance of the paper to ICLR though. The paper appears to be only relevant to a very small subgroup of ICLR attendees and more suited for EC type conferences.\n\nCould the authors please comment on the relevance of the paper regarding topics of relevance at ICLR? How would one utilize the presented results in practice?"}
