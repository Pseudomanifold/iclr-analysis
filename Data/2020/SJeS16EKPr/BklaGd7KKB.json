The proposed metric can also be used as an alternative to cross entropy loss. The paper provides analytical calculations as well as real data sets simulations/experiments. However there are significant draw-becks:\n\n1) Similarity and Metric Learning is a booming area in machine learning with several different directions focusing on different problems. The paper fails to locates itself in the literature, how it compares itself into other techniques (both analytically and experimentally). \n\n2) The proposed technique seems to be very similar to SVD of learned representations. Connection to quantum field theory is well established but more simpler comparisons to SVD and other spectral techniques are not provided in metric learning.\n\n3) Novelty is not clear. There are interesting experiments in disentangled feature feature extraction and data generation. However, they are mostly proof of concept and lack of baselines. It is not clear what problem this technique solves better compared to other existing solutions. \n\nPaper is mostly written clearly. I do suggest putting Appendix A1 to the main paper though."}
