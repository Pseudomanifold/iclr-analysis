The paper is difficult to read because it assumes the reader is an expert on Tensor Product Representations. Many important terms are not clearly defined, which makes difficult to follow. For example, the terms \u201croles\u201d and \u201cfiller\u201d are not defined. I think a quick introduction to the field with a clarifying figure would be greatly appreciated by general readers. However, I think the contribution of the paper is important and presented experimental results, comparing the method against classical LSTM and GRU architectures, seem to be relevant for the field.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
