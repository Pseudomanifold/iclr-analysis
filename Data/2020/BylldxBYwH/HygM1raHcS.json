Specifically the sections on e.g. loss seem to have a lot of prior work. It\u2019s difficult for me to judge the exact amount of novelty in this paper with respect to the physics. With respects to the DL part it looks like it\u2019s mainly minor modifications to the known U-net architecture. \n* With respect to the introduction of the stream function branch, in table 1 one can observe that the error is actually higher than simply without it. The authors argue that \u201cthe synthetic velocity field data has discretisation errors and it is not truly divergence free. Therefore, the approach with a single stream function branch cannot capture the divergent modes present on the original data\u201d. I\u2019m not sure exactly what to think of this .. in my opinion this means they should use a more accurate flow solver for their simulation as otherwise it is hard to draw any definite conclusion here and only speculation remains. \n* I guess the inpainting works decently well, as is expected from previous image inpainting literature and the problem is essentially treated as image completion. However, I can\u2019t really visually tell much of a difference between the images shown for the different approaches/components in figures 3-6. Again, this ties back to my previous component about lack of clarity of the improvement of the introduced individual terms. \n* I find it a little bit weird that there is exactly one reference prior to 2012. Fluid dynamics isn\u2019t exactly a field that was introduced 5 years ago. Also their paper ends before the 8 page limit. I think the authors could have used the remaining space more efficiently. \n\nI generally like the idea of including physical consistency when training to train a neural network for a respective task where this matters. I\u2019m just not sure I have a clear take-away from this paper as the results don\u2019t seem to carry a clear message of the proposed approaches resulting in definite improvements over more naive approaches or including only partial physical consistency. \n"}
