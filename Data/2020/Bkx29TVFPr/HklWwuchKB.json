In such settings, learning the conditional mode is more desirable than the conditional mean, the latter being the focus of standard regression approaches. The objective in model regression is to find the conditional mode. \n\nExisting non-parametric approaches to learning the conditional mode are difficult to scale. On the other hand, existing parametric approaches for modal regression aim to learn the full conditional distribution, which is a much harder problem. The present work proposes a parametric approach to estimate the conditional mode using the Implicit Function Theorem. The key idea is to learn a (parametric and implicit) function f(x,y) whose minima(s) 'y' corresponds to the conditional modes. However, the paper does not explain clearly how the above idea is put to practice as an algorithm in Section 3. It will be great if Section 3 can be re-written with more detailed explanations in paragraphs following the \"Implicit Function Theorem\" definition and more examples. \n\nThe experiments mainly are performed artificial datasets to assess the algorithm when the underlying multi-model distributions are known. Empirical results are also discussed on a couple of real-world datasets where the proposed algorithm obtains the best results. "}
