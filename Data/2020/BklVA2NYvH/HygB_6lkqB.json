This paper proposes a method that based on optimal control theory that uses semidefinite-programming. This is a quite popular topic in Adversarial training recently, there has been a few works in that line. There are almost no experiments in this paper. There are several typos in the paper and writing of this paper requires more work. There are several typos in this paper, for example STOA, should be SOTA (in the Section 6.) In its current state, this paper looks very rushed.\n\n\nAs Yiping Lu pointed out, the PMP statement in this paper is also wrong. At this current stage, unfortunately this paper doesn\u2019t meet the standards of ICLR. I would recommend the authors to go over the paper carefully and resubmit to a different venue.\n\n\n"}
