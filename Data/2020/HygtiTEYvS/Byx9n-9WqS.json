I suggest exploring more environments and more complex ones than MountainCar. \n* I do not believe this is the first attempt in translating an environment represention to a different one. Other techniques in domain adaptation have been working on this for quite some time. It might be the case that the technique proposed here is better eg to pixel-based adaptation or adaptation of features, but it would need to be shown experimentally.\n* Given the higher number of pages, i would have expected more thorough experimentation.
