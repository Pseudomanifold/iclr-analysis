It is lead to Wasserstein distance between representations. Experiments are made on three datasets; ColorMNIST, MNIST, and CelebA, which shows superior performance on adversarial accuracy while similar accuracy to VAE on nominal accuracy.\nThe paper is well-organized and well-written. The point is clear and the proposed algorithm is valid. The only problem of the paper is the improvement on the experiment is marginal. Although adversarial accuracy is far better (like 0% vs 50%), it is apparent that the vanilla VAE is fragile to the adversarial examples because the added noise is intended so. Thus I can not say this is a fair comparison and because the superiority of the proposed algorithm is shown in only this point, I am not sure the proposed algorithm is surely useful. \n"}
