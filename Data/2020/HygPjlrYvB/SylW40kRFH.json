Experiments and comparisons with SOTA are provided.\n\nPros:\nTheir idea of making an adaption to GAN architecture by replacing the generator by a classifier to select P from U and using the discriminator to distinguish whether the selected data is from P or U for PU learning is interesting, and benefits from not relying on the class prior estimation.\n\nQuestion:\nThe authors claim that Eq. (2) cannot be trained in an end-to-end fashion directly, this statement may need some modification since there are some existing works replacing c(x) by a score function or some other continuous function and then this direct adaptation can be trained, for example, see Eq. (5) in \u201cDiscriminative adversarial networks for positive-unlabeled learning. arXiv:1906.00642, 2019\u201d. Can any explanation be given on this?\n\nRemarks:\nThe clarity of the paper could be improved in multiple places. For example, the data generation processes can be mathematically defined in the problem setting part, now it is quite confusing to me. And more details on experimental protocol may be needed: e.g. what kind of hyperparameter tuning was done?\n \nIn general, the paper proposed an interesting GAN-like network architecture to learn from PU data, but some unclear parts need to be improved.
