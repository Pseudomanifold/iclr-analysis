In achieving that, it proposes a new 3D convolutional block that convolves the input with its context. This two-iterations of convolutions are referred to as higher-order reasoning. In doing this, the proposal is based on the assumption that relevant context is present around the object (in line with traditional context in images). This is in contrast with recent approaches that search for relevant context anywhere in the image (e.g. video action transformer, 2019 and non-local neural networks, 2018). \n\nThe paper has two critical issues for concern:\nThe first is lacking to properly place the paper in context with state-of-the-art or alternative approaches. The related work is surprisingly short - either missing or briefly mentioning prior work without a discussion of similarities/differences. Importantly:\n*) current approaches that use non-neighbouring context (Video Action Transformer, 2019) without a CRF are not noted. Older approaches (non-local neural network) are noted in related work under \"CRF-based\" but the authors do not expand on why these methods are not suitable to solve the problem at hand, or the fundamental distinctions between such approaches.\n*) Other approaches that attempt exactly the same purpose of higher-order context convolutions (Attend and Interact: Higher-Order Object Interactions for Video Understanding, 2018) are not mentioned altogether. This gives the incorrect impression that such higher-order context is novel and previously unexplored. In fact the paper (Attend and Interact) achieves iterative context attention through a recurrent network. Equation 4 in the noted paper seems to be very similar to the equations in the introduction of this paper.\n*) Temporal-relational reasoning paper is another paper that discusses higher-order dependencies, though only for temporal dependencies rather than spatio-temporal. This paper is also ignored in the related work though referred to in some of the experiments. [note: the reference has missing authors and incorrect order of authors]\n*) Another paper with, again, the same motivation is: Temporal Reasoning Graph for Activity Recognition, though this is more recent (Aug 2019) so I can understand why it had been missed. However, it would be nice to understand how the proposed H block differs from the proposed architecture in Temporal Reasoning Graph.\n\nWhile the paper offers a number of ablation and cross-dataset results, the authors do not report results on any \"unseen test\" subsets. For example, in reporting on Something-Something V2, other papers combine their validation accuracy with the test accuracy on the unseen test set. This avoids overfitting or reporting best performance on the validation set. Similarly on Charades, results on the validation set rather than the actual test set are reported. This is slightly concerning as it's easier to prove higher performance when the ground-truth is within hands. Pairing validation/test results would be the expectation for fair analysis to other published papers.\n\nIn addition to the above major concerns, the paper would benefit from better write-up. It's confusing to read at times and the same concept is repeated multiple times, with others briefly rushed over. The paper also refers multiple times to the advantages of having less parameters than alternative CNNs, but it is not clear how the number of parameters of the proposed solution differs from other state of the art.\n\nMy rating is based on the concern that it is not possible to make conclusions on the contribution of this paper, theoretically (compared to published works) or experimentally (on unseen test sets), from the submitted manuscript as is."}
