LIke BERT, it proposes a tranformer based approach to derive a pre-trained network for representing images and texts. The resulting pre-trained network, used in 9 different tasks, advances the SOTA on all the tasks. \nThe major limitation of this paper is why. Why does it happen? How this results can be achieved? What is exactly represented in this pre-trained network. Why the tasks used for pre-training build a network that is so informative?\nThis is really the major obscure point of this impressive paper.\n"}
