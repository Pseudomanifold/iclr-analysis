Their method, SemanticAdv, leverages disentangled semantic factors and interpolates feature-map with higher freedom than attribute-space. Their adversarial optimization objectives combine both attack effectiveness and interpolation smoothness. They conduct extensive experiments for several tasks compared with CW-attack, showing broad applicability of the proposed method.\n\nThe paper is well written and technically sound with concrete experimental results. I'm glad to suggest accepting the paper.\n\nWith the help of attribute-conditional StarGAN, SemanticAdv generates adversarial examples by interpolating feature-maps conditioned on attributes. They design adversarial optimization objectives with specific attack objectives for identity verification and structured prediction tasks. They provide experiments showing the effectiveness of SemanticAdv; analysis on attributes, attack transferability, black-box attack, and robustness against defenses; as well as user study with subjective. The qualitative results also look nice and the code base is open-sourced.\n\nA question out of curiosity, the last conv layer in the generator is used as the feature-map. How is the attack effectiveness of using other layers?"}
