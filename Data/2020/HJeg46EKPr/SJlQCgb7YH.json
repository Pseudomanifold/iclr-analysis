The proposed method mainly consists of three parts: creating a tensor from time-series data, applying tensor decomposition, and clustering. The performance is evaluated with a real satellite data set.\n\nThough the results look interesting, I vote for rejection because the paper is not well fitted to the ICLR community. \n\nThis paper specifically focuses on the anomaly detection of satellites. I don't say the application study is less worthy but the scope of this paper is too narrow for the ML community. The methodology of this work is basically combining the existing technology and is not novel enough. The performance is validated only by a single data set. So I feel this paper is more like a case study of a specific application and is more appropriate submitting to data mining conferences such as KDD."}
