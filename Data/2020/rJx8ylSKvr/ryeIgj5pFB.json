The paper cites papers from physical letters and physical reviews without introducing all necessary background. From this point of view the paper is not self content enough for the audience of the conference.   \nI don\u2019t know what is the quantum many-body problem, never heard of StartEnd separation rank\u2026 mentioned in the first paragraph of the paper.\n\nIn addition to the fundamental contribution that i could not summarize well, the paper includes an experimental validation of the contribution on the question answering problem on benchmark datasets, showing very relevant results outperforming the baselines, which look like state of the art methods in the field. \n\nNot sure to fully understand the experimental setting though. In particular i understand that the dataset are divided in isolated parts on which different models are learned. And averaged results are reported. But is it a fair comparison with the baselines ?   \n\nAt the end the paper looks quite interesting and promising but in its current shape it doesn\u2019t seem to me fully accessible to ICLR audience.
