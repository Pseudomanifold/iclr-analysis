The paper presents experiments where it is shown that deep RL methods are outperformed in that question.\n\nI recommend to reject the paper.\n\nThe reason for this are threefold.\n- The paper is crowded with text and ends up to be hard to follow. The actual contribution is hard to distill.\n- The method compares to deep RL baselines. But these are *not* planning algorithms, instead these are RL methods. The paper does not compare to planners, which are tailored to solve the problem the paper adresses.\n- The reader is left alone to place the work within the literature. The abstract and introduction do not have a single cite; terms like TAMP and multi-step planning are mentioned and certain properties of them are stated without resorting to where a reader could look those up. It is not the readers task to use a search engine to reverse engineer the authors writing!\n\nI think that the authors need to reformulate what the contribution of their work is. That needs to be presented in a more abstract way, without focusing on the experimental setting prematurely. The experimental setup is ok if the method is restricted to robotic tasks, but too thin for the general setting of efficient planning with sparse costs. Planning algorithms that are tailored towards huge spaces shou;d be used as base lines instead of deep RL methods."}
