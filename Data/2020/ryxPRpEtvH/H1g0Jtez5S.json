They attribute this to increasing model diversity in the former case, and experimentally validate their claims.\n\nMAJOR COMMENTS: \n1. Motivation Unclear:\n- Notational issues in (2): MSE(h_t | x) involves y, but y is not specified in the definition. As a result, later E_{x}[\u2026] is evaluated disregarding the dependence on y, which is ambiguous. \n- Derivation of the second equality in (2) is not obvious, and needs a detailed proof. Notational issues exist in switching between H and h.\n- The above is used to argue that \u201cthe more diverse the models, the better performance achieved\u201d. It is unclear how this follows from (2).\n\n2. Unclear / Imprecise Writing\n- Before Sec. 3.4:  \u201cThis is because higher Dropout rates lead to smaller effective network capacities\u201d Needs reference. \n- \u201cDropout uncertainty can be obtained sequentially\u201d. Unclear what this means.\n\n3. The entire proposed method is described in one line, \u201cwe propose a novel omnibus dropout strategy, which merely combines all the aforementioned methods\u201d. It is very unclear as to what the authors mean by combination.\n\n4. Experiments\n- It seems that Omnibus dropout leads to a moderate \u201cdiversity\u201d, and improves ensemble performance only for SVHN, out of the three datasets tested in Figure 4. For SVHN, the improvement is 0.1% accuracy, which is within the standard error (0.1). Hence, it seems that the proposed method provides no performance improvement.\n- A Similar statement is true for the other metrics (NLL, Brier Score, ECE). \n\nScore [Scale of 1-10]:\n3: Reject\nThe paper needs either more convincing experiments demonstrating the claims or theoretical analysis explaining the behavior for small networks. The paper needs to be rewritten to improve presentation, and state motivation, problem statement, and contributions clearly. \n"}
