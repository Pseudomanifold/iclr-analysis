The neural network is used to correct the numerical solver. For different tasks they set up an approximation scheme via minimizing a square loss plus a task specific regularization (e.g. volume preservation in the Navier-Stokes equation example). This is then trained in a supervised manner. They also explore an unsupervised version by back-progagating through a differentiable numberical solver.\nThe proposed method seems straight forward, but effective as the simulations seem to indicate."}
