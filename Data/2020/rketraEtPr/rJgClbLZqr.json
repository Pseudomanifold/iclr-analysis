What about other baseline models use similar deep learning approaches?\n- There should be various PDE problems other than Navier-Stokes to evaluate the general effectiveness of the proposed model.\n- I think time comparison/analysis should be provided since the paper targets to get efficient approximation (using NN) in numerical analysis field.\n\nQuestions and comments\n- I wonder the affect of hyper-parameter in temporal regularization.\n- I wonder performance comparison to existing NN based approaches."}
