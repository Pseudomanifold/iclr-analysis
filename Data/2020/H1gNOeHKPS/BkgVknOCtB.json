The authors show that their proposed modules are capable of performing arithmetic tasks with higher accuracy, faster convergence, and more theoretically well-grounded foundations.\n\nThe new modules modules are relatively novel, and significantly outperform their closest architectural relatives, both in accuracy and convergence time. The authors also go to significant lengths to demonstrate that the parameters in these modules can be initialized and learned in a more theoretically well-grounded manner than their NAC/NALU counterparts. For these reasons I believe this paper should be accepted.\n\nGeneral advice/feedback:\n- should provide an explanation of the row in Table 2 showing that a simple linear transformation is able to achieve accuracy and convergence times comparable to those of the NAU\n- should provide an explanation of the universal 0% success rate on the U[1.1,1.2] sampling interval in Figure 3\n- inconsistent captioning in Figure 2c, missing \"NAC\u2022 with\"\n- should clarify in Section 4.1 that the \"arithmetic dataset\" task involves summing only *contiguous* vector entries; this is implied by the summation notation, and made explicit in Appendix Section C, but not specified in Section 4.1\n- it is unclear what experiments you performed to obtain Figure 3, and the additional explanation in Appendix Section C.4 regarding interpolation/extrapolation intervals only adds to the confusion; please clarify the explanation of Figure 3, or else move it to the Appendix\n- the ordering of some of the sections/figures is confusing and nonstandard: Section 1.1 presents results before explaining what exactly is being measured, Figure 1 shows an illustration of an NMU 2 pages before it is defined, Section 3 could be merged with the Introduction\n\nGrammatical/Typesetting errors:\n- \"an theoretical\" : bottom of pg 2\n- \"also found empirically in (see Trask et al.
