The terminal value function is used to improve stability.  The theoretical guarantee of the error of the model-based gradient is presented. Experimental results show that MAAC outperforms SAC, STEVE, and MBPO on four environments in terms of the sample efficiency.\n\nThe experimental results are strong and I appreciate the plots of the gradient error in a simple task, shown in Figure 3. But I want to see the comparison of the final performance of each algorithm in these environments, and I doubt that the baselines do not converge.\n\nHowever, the paper is badly written. First of all, the authors claim that the pathwise derivate method is applied to optimize the objective function. But the detail of the method is missing. Secondly, I can not follow the procedure of how Q function is learned in the MAAC algorithm. Thirdly, Theorem 4.1 gives a performance improvement bound of the new policy w.r.t J_pi without the entropy term. But the MAAC algorithm optimizes the objective with the policy entropy term.\n\nAlso, MAAC applies many techniques in other papers. The paper does not clearly show the advantage of each component:\n(1) I want to see the experimental results of MAAC optimizing the objective without the entropy.  \n(2) The SVG(1) algorithm should be compared as a baseline as the SVG(1) also uses the gradient of the learned model to optimize the policy.\n(3) The policy and the Q function are optimized on both the real samples and the generated samples. I want to see the ablation study or justification on whether training on real samples or both samples.\n\nQuestions:\n1. How many independent runs are used in experiments?\n2. Does the computation of the pathwise derivate method cost much time\uff1f Is MAAC much slower than SAC?\n\nI am happy to increase my score if the authors justify these questions."}
