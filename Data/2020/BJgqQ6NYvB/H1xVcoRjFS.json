The proposed method is discovered from a search space integrating multi-resolution branches, that has been recently found to be vital in manually designed segmentation models. To calibrate the balance between the goals of high accuracy and low latency, the authors propose a decoupled and fine-grained latency regularization, that effectively overcomes the observed phenomenons that the searched networks are prone to \u201ccollapsing\u201d to low-latency yet poor-accuracy models. Moreover, the authors extend the proposed method to a new collaborative search (co-searching) framework, simultaneously searching for a teacher and a student network in the same single run. The teacher-student distillation further boosts the student model\u2019s accuracy. Experimental results on Cityscapes, CamVid, and BDD verified the efficacy of the proposed method.\n\nThe writing is clear and the presentation is good. I like the motivation of this paper. The problem solved in this paper aligns with reality.\n\nMy concerns regarding this paper are as below.\n1) The datasets used for evaluation are quite old except BDD, which make the results not so convincing. More experiments on more recent challenging semantic segmentation benchmarks are needed to verify the superiorities claimed in this paper. e.g., MHP v2.0 [Zhao et al., ACM MM 2018], etc.\n2) The methods compared in Tab.6 are quite old, please add comparisons with more recent SOTAs.\n3) Please add qualitative analysis to gain insight into the proposed method and to show why works better than other SOTAs.\n4) The results in Tab.4,5,6 of the proposed method are not the best for mIoU on testing protocol, is this a trade-off between acc and speed?\n\nBased on the above overall comments, I decide to give the rate of Weak Accept for this paper.", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I carefully checked the derivations and theory."}
