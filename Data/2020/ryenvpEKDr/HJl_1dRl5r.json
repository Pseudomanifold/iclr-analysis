The topic is interesting, while I was expecting to learn more from the paper, instead of some well-known conclusions. If the paper could provide some guidance for model and data selection, that would be an interesting paper for the ICLR audience.  For instance, how deep should a model be for a classification or regression task? What is the minimum/maximum layers of a deep model? How much data is sufficient for a model to learn? What is the minimum/maximum size of the data set? Do we really need a large data set or just a subset that covers the data distribution? What's the relation between the size of a model and that of a data set? By increasing the depth/width of a neural network, how much new data should be collected for achieving a reasonable performance? How about the gain of the task performance? "}
