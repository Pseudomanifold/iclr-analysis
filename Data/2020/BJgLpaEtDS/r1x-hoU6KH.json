Experimental results on the synthetic and real data sets show the performance of the proposed model. In general, the paper is well organized.  The proposed algorithm is promising. My main concern is the motivation of the paper and the experiments. In particular, \n \n(1) It is unclear what is the major contribution of this paper over the existing work, e.g., [10,22,23]. The authors may want to provide more discussion regarding this in the literature review. \n(2) It is unclear where is the impact of the proposed PWA model in real applications. Also, it is unclear why the data like MNIST, CORA, CITESEER, PUBMED exhibit hierarchical data structure. \n(3) The experiments are questionable. In table 2, why  CORA, CITESEER, PUBMED are adopted as the evaluation datasets? why only VGAE is considered as the baseline methods in link predict? "}
