In this setting, the victim has a fixed policy but the adversary has no access to its white-box information. Instead, the adversary can freely access the black-box policy of the victim. The experiments show that the trained adversary outperforms the baseline in some scenarios, with three interesting findings: 1) the adversary successfully found the weakness of the victim. In some scenarios, the adversary wins by doing some weird actions which make no sense, but those weird actions somehow make the victim fail; 2) the victim fails due to the weird (or I should say adversarial) observation from the adversary but not the physical inference. The authors demonstrate this by showing that the victim has a much higher success rate when the observation is replaced with a \u2018normal\u2019 opponent. I am kind of on the borderline, but still lean to accept paper.\nStrengths\n- This paper presents some experiments on adversarial learning when the policy of the victim is fixed and black-box with interesting findings, demonstrates that the adversary can successfully figure out the weakness of the victim.\n- The paper formalizes the problem into an MDP whose dynamics is unknown, which is clear.\n- This paper comes with many experiments supported by great demos, which clearly support the authors\u2019 arguments.\nWeaknesses\n- The paper becomes messy in the end and does not come with a good conclusion. With a lot of experiments conducted, the author fails to summarize them into an (or a few) interesting conclusion(s), but end up with a page-long conclusion paragraph, which makes the paper less focused but like listing miscellaneous experiments. From the reader\u2019s perspective, a (or a few) clear conclusion would be very helpful.\nPossible Improvements\nMy suggestion is to reorganize the second half of the paper, to make a few clear arguments. Currently, the paper looks pretty narrative, and the author might easily get lost while reading the paper."}
