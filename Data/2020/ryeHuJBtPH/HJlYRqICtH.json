The authors do so by introducing a multi-head attention mechanism that takes in a set of node features and predicts the probability of this set of nodes forming a hyperedge.\n\n- Quality and clarity: \n\nThe quality of the paper is good, the writing is clear and the reasoning is relatively easy to follow. The problem the authors are trying to tackle is also clearly defined. The motivation of the dynamic and static embedding choice could be explained better. The intuition that the pseudo-distance tells us how well the static embedding\nof a node can be approximated by the features of the neighbour within the tuple somewhat makes sense, but I also have the impression that this is just one possible interpretation and what happens in practice could actually be quite different. A more formal treatment and analysis of this intuition would be very helpful.\n\n- Originality: \nThe main contribution here is to propose a more flexible formulation to improve over the fixed MLP used by DHNE. This in itself is a good idea, but overall is an incremental improvement.\n\n- Significance: \nThe results are convincing, DHNE is clearly outperformed on the benchmarks. Depending on the ease of training the model compared to DHNE, this work might be a useful contribution for the ICLR community.\n\nOther points\n\nThe related work section should be expanded by discussing relationships to:\n\nBai, Song, Feihu Zhang, and Philip HS Torr. \"Hypergraph Convolution and Hypergraph Attention.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1901.08150 (2019).\n\nFeng, Yifan, et al. \"Hypergraph neural networks.\" Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence.
