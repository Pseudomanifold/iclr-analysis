The algorithm builds on GAIL with the following modifications \u2013 the discriminator is made dynamics-invariant by adding a domain-adversarial loss, and the policy is made to condition on a dynamics context. A separate dynamics posterior network is trained (either supervised or unsupervised) to predict this context at test-time. \n\n\nI have the following concerns about the paper:\n\n1.\tLack of novelty: \n         a.\tLearning a dynamics-invariant discriminator with the gradient-reversal-layer was proposed in Stadie et. al (2017). How is this approach different? In particular, what is the new element in Figure 1. and complete Section 3.4?  \n         b.\tLearning a posterior network to predict context codes, and conditioning the policy on those was explored in papers such DIAYN and InfoGAIL. \n\n2.\tThe proposed algorithm is reliant on the possibility of being able to sample from a distribution of environments (with varying dynamics), and then collect many trajectories in that environment (Line 6-7 in Algorithm 1). This is a severe requirement for real-word scenarios, and somewhat antithetic to the robotics learning motivation given by the authors in the introduction. Moreover, Figure 7 seems to imply that the method doesn\u2019t generalize well to unseen environments, if enough environments can\u2019t be sampled during training time.\n\n\nMinor comment:\n\nFigure 8. Friction value should not go from -3 to 3. Also, this single result inspires no confidence in the benefit or general applicability of the VAE-based context prediction.\n"}
