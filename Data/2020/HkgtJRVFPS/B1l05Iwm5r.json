The general aim is to preserve the topological properties of data while performing dimensionality reduction. \n \nThe proposed method computes the persistent homology of the 0-dimensional Vietoris\u2013Rips by means of persistence diagrams and persistence pairing. The additional step is to computes the regularization loss, by posing the constraint that the persistent homology be similar between data space and latent space. The empirical analysis investigates the stability property with respect to the mini-batch sampling. \n\nThe extended experiments don't provide an empirical evidence of the added value of a topological AE. The results are quite controversial if we focus our attention on MSE measures. AE and TopoAE behave in a similar way and it is not clear whether such a difference is statistically significant. \n\nThe work is missing a mandatory comparison with Hofer et al. (2019b) that proposes a loss very similar to the one presented in Section 3, even though the authors remark that their formulation is more general. For example an interesting comparison could have been with the real-case application of classification for the images datasets (e.g. CIFAR, MNIST, ImageNet) where Hofer et al. (2019b) proves their claims.\n\nThe computational issues of the d-dimensional Vietoris-Rips with d > 0, limits the preservation of only simple structures in the point-cloud.\n"}
