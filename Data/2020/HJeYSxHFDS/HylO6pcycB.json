They conducted experiments on different datasets, including the MNIST dataset. They achieved good results comparing to baseline spherical CNNs. However, the advantage of this method over S2CNN can be further elaborated, as S2CNN already achieved high accuracy; it seems like the one improvement is the complexity (improved from S2CNN's $O(N \\log N)$ to their model's $O(N)$), but the reduction of complexity is not significantly reflected in the training time per epoch (from 380s to 284 s). \n4. Overall, the paper provides clear theoretical backgrounds on gauge CNNs that justifies their definition of convolution operator only uses the intrinsic structure of the manifold (does not reply on higher dimensional embedding)."}
