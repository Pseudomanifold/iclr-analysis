The novel contributions are in taking the Gauge equivariance CNN and finding efficient ways to perform logarithmic mapping, parallel transport, and convolution by the equivariant kernel when applied to the sphere. An interpolation scheme for an improved approximation to global SO(3) symmetry is also discussed. Experimental results on spherical MNIST, climate pattern segmentation, and omnidirectional semantic segmentation demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed method for prediction on a sphere.\n\nFor the most part, the paper is very clearly written despite the challenging and technical nature of the topic. In particular, the first four pages provide a nice overview of related work and a clear explanation of the Gauge equivariance framework of Cohen et al\u201919. Two sections that can benefit from further clarification are the proposed \"regular non-linearities\" (where it would be nice to show in equation why we have equivariance), and equation (4), the logarithmic map (where I had a hard time mapping the discussion in words to the equation). \n\nHowever, the experiments, while satisfactory, are not impressive: one issue is that the results are mostly compared to the results of two relevant papers by Cohen and colleagues. In recent years, there have been other proposals for deep learning on the sphere, and I wonder why experiments do not try to compare with these works?  (see Kondor et al\u201918, Coors et al\u201918, and others cited in the paper.) Moreover, although in theory, the proposed framework improves the Icosahedral CNN of Cohen et al\u201919 (by directly operating on the sphere rather than an Icosahedral approximation), the practical improvements over the Icosahedral CNN seem to be often marginal (with one exception in spherical MNIST). Do you have any explanation for this? Is there any setup where you expect the proposed approach would give a substantial improvement?\n"}
