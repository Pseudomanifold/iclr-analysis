The present paper instantiates this framework for the case of the sphere.\n\nThe sphere is the simplest natural non-trivial manifold to try out gauge invariant networks on, and spherical CNNs have several applications. However, other than the details of the interpolation etc., there is really very little in this paper that is new relative to the original paper by Cohen et al., it reads a bit more like an extended \"experiments\" section. \n\nUnfortunately the experimental results are not all that remarkable either, probably because the tasks are relatively easy, so other SO(3) equivariant architectures do quite well too. Given that there is essentially no new theory in the paper, I would have welcomed a much more thorough experimental section, comparing different architectures, different discretization strategies of the sphere and different interpolations/basis functions."}
