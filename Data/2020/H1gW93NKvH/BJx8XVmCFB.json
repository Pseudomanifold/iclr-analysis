The paper is presented in a fairly clear way and I have no general negative comments about the idea itself, but I am also not able to assess the claims for state-of-art performance. With that said, I am still leaning towards reject.\n\nOnly a few algorithms are compared with in a small scale problem, and the results are not very conclusive when viewing the three measures as a whole.\n\nThe purpose seems to be to improve video game streaming, but the speed of the algorithm does not make it practically useful yet, as the authors acknowledge. If existing techniques are practically useful, then that\u2019s a drawback. One can wish for faster computers, but these other techniques were working within realistic constraints. I assume they will improve too with better computation speed."}
