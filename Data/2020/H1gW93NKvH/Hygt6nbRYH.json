The work presents promising results in comparison with related supervised approaches and GAN-based approaches.\n \nHowever, in the submission the algorithm is tested only on a private dataset without any statistics description. Comparison on commonly used datasets (e.g. BAPPS, Vid4, etc.) and standard metrics PSNR is not presented in evaluation. Therefore, the performance of the proposed algorithm cannot be well justified.\n \nOther comments are:\n1. Improvement of proposed connection is not clearly demonstrated. Is there any comparison between the skip connection in ResNet and the proposed connection?\n\n2. The running speed of the proposed DRR architecture. Is it faster than other related works? Please present the comparison of the running time.\n"}
