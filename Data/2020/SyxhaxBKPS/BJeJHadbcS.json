The proposed regularization function is covered in detail and the results are evaluated on MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets\n\nThe authors can improve the submission by \n1. evaluating more modern networks with bigger datasets, as opposed to the ones demonstrated.\n2. describing gamma (eq 10) , it wasn't clear why that parameter was introduced (in addition to the beta) and it's significance, what was more confusing is coverage for this instead of beta in the experimental setup\n3. why the LR needed to be modified for the described method"}
