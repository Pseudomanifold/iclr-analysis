The problem appears to be important for semi-supervised training of image to image translation models, where we may have a lot of observations in both domains, but a little annotated correspondences between the domains.\n\nThe solution proposed by the authors involves an observation that discriminator in GANs is estimating the density ratio between real and fake distributions. This ratio can then be decomposed into a product of marginal density ratios, with two additional multipliers, corresponding to density ratios between a joint real/fake distribution and a product of its marginals. The authors then use discriminators to approximate all the ratios, which allows them to facilitate semi-supervised training.\n\nMy decision is \"weak accept\".\n\nIt is not clear to me to what extent does the proposed model outperform the regular CycleGAN on a large amount of paired training samples due to architectural changes (including spectral normalization).\n\nAlso, it would be nice if the comparison was carried out with a newer, possibly SotA models for unpaired image-to-image translation (MUNIT, FUNIT, BicycleGAN).\n\nMoreover, there are some simple modifications that can be made to a standard CycleGAN/Pix2pix training pipeline that would facilitate the small number of annotations (for example, see \"Learning image-to-image translation using paired and unpaired training samples\").\n\nIt is hard to evaluate the comparative performance of the method without the comparisons mentioned above.", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I assessed the sensibility of the derivations and theory."}
