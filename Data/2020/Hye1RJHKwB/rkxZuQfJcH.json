FactorGANs are applied to the problem of semi-supervised (paired+unpaired) translation and demonstrate good performance.\n\nStrengths:\n-Nice formulation, which I believe is novel. Well written, good initial results.\n\nLimitations:\n-The most serious limitation of the paper is that the technique is not compared with any other semi-supervised methods, such as the Augmented CycleGAN. Because of this it is not clear how the technique compares with SOTA, and so the significance of the paper is not clear.\n-The approach scales linearly with the number of marginals, which may limit its applicability to more general imputation tasks.\n-The title is the same as an the arxiv paper title, and so the double-blind requirement is trivially violated.\n\nOverall:\n\nA nice formulation, but weak experimental investigations (no comparisons to SOTA semi-supervised translation) make the significance of the paper unclear. This makes it a borderline paper. I strongly encourage the authors to update their experiments accordingly.\n"}
