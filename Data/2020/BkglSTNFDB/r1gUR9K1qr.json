(2018) to infinite horizon discounted MDPs, and prove a PAC bound of \\tilde{O}(SA/\\epsilon^2 (1-\\gamma)^7) for the resulting algorithm. This bound improves the one for delayed Q-learning by Strehl et al. (2006) and matches the lower-bound in terms of \\epsilon, S, and A. \n\n\nComments:\n- Overall, the paper is well-written and well-structured. Although most of the results are in the appendix, the authors have done a good job in what they reported in the paper and what they left for the appendix. \n- I personally think ICLR is not a good venue for this kind of papers. Places like COLT and journals are better because they allow the authors to report most of the results in the main paper, and give more time to the reviewers to go over all the proofs. \n- I did not have time to go over all the proofs in the appendix but I checked those in the paper. I did not find any error, but the math can be written more rigorously. \n- The algorithm is quite similar to the one by Jin et al. (2018), which is for finite-horizon problems. The authors discuss on Page 4 that why despite the similarity of the algorithms, the techniques in Jin et al. (2018) cannot be directly applied to their case. It would be good if the authors have a discussion on the novelty of the techniques used in their analysis, not only w.r.t. Jin et al. (2018), but w.r.t. other analysis of model free algorithms in infinite-horizon discounted problems. \n- What makes this work different than Jin et al. (2018), and is its novelty, is obtaining a PAC bound. The resulting regret bound is similar to the one in Jin et al. (2018), but the PAC bound is new. It would be good if the authors mention this on Page 4. This makes it more clear in which sense this work is different than that by Jin et al. (2018). \n- It is important to write in the statement of Condition 2 that \"i\" changes between 0 and \\log_2 R. \n"}
