The posteriors of Bayesian NN weights are highly multi-modal and present difficulty for standard stochastic gradient MCMC methods. The proposed cyclical version periodically warm start the SG-MCMC process such that it can explore the multimodal space more efficiently.\n\nThe proposed method as well as the empirical results intuitively make sense. The standard SG-MCMC basically has one longer stepsize schedule and is exploring the weight space more patiently, but only converges to one local mode. The cyclical SG-MCMC uses multiple shorter stepsize schedules, so each one is similar to a (stochastic) greedy search. Consequently, the cSG-MCMC can collect more diverse samples across the weight space, while the samples of SG-MCMC are more concentrated, but likely with better quality (as shown in Figure 3). \n\nPersonally I would like to see how Bayesian deep learning can be applied to real large-scale applications. Probabilistic inference is expensive; Bayesian model averaging is even more expensive. That's probably why recent literature focuses on variational inference or expectation propagation-based approaches. "}
