Many experimental results, including ImageNet, are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. \n\nHere I suggest that authors also need to point out that the continuous-time MCMC is the Wasserstein gradient flow of KL divergence. The bound derived in this paper focus on the step size choice of gradient flows. This could be a good direction for combining gradient flows studies in optimal transport and MCMC convergence bound for the choice of step size. \n\nOverall, I think that the paper is well written with clear derivations. I strongly suggest the publication of this paper. "}
