It proposes measures on whether the data in neighboring nodes are useful in terms of labels or features. It also provides a new Graph Neural Network algorithm that is a modification of attention-based models incorporating the derived label and feature smoothness measures. The paper demonstrates the usefulness of these measures and algorithms with several different baselines from different families. The writing is mostly smooth, and the authors seem to provide enough detail of the experiments performed.\n\nThe proposed measures look simple but effective (as demonstrated in Table 2). The paper compares different techniques and shows that when neighboring labels are not smooth, techniques such as label propagation does not help. I do recommend Table 4 Lambda f and Lambda l values to be included in the main paper (though text mentions). When incorporated into the attention-based GNNs, Figure 1 also shows that smoothness parameters of the techniques also improve. "}
