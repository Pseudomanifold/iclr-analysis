DHN enables soft SSL learning based on the existing tools from optimal transportation. The idea of treating hyperedges as vertexes of another graph is novel and the theoretical analysis is sound.\n\nHowever, the paper has the following issues:\n\n1) The writing is poor, especially about the reference, and the description of how and why DHN works (section 3.3).\n\n2) The novelty is restricted. It seems that the only innovation is introducing the information from the hyperedges into $H_E^{(0)}$.\n\n3) Though the experiments on Cora and DBLP have revealed the superiority of DHN, the authors still need a more thorough empirical evaluation on some challenging benchmarks to draw the conclusion.\n\nI'm willing to increase my score if the concerns are addressed.\n"}
