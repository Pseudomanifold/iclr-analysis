On the one hand, the vertex labels should be not only numerical or categorical variables but also probability distributions. On the other hand, hypergraphs provide a much more flexible mean to encode the real-world complicated relationship compared to the essential pairwise association. Specifically, the authors carefully obtain the generalization error bounds for a one-layer graph neural network. The experiments support the theory and provide the empirical verification of the proposed method. The appendix offers plenty of details that are helpful for the reader to understand both the theoretical and practical perspectives of this paper. Also, the code looks good to me. The structure of the provided codebase is clear and well documented.\n\nI have some questions and suggestions for the authors:\n1. In the method section 3.3, the authors said that \u201cA key idea of our approach is to treat each hyperedge as a vertex of the graph\u201d After this transformation, the graph could be super sparse. So I\u2019d like to know more about the efficiency of the proposed method. Because the datasets in this paper could not be considered as a giant graph. The efficiency could be much more critical for large-scale applications. Besides, such conversion could be one of the most significant technical novelty in this paper, which makes me worry about the methodology contribution of this submission.\n\n2. In the theoretical analysis section 4, there are lots of references for the existing lemmas and theorems. It could be much better if the authors could briefly review and summarize these equations before applying them. By the way, I appreciate the detailed appendix at the same time. But such a summary could complete the paper in a more self-contained way. Also, the authors should improve the writing of paper at the same time.\n\n3. In the experiments section 5, I wonder if the authors would consider some more challenging datasets with the larger graph to evaluate the proposed method. Also, the theoretical analysis is about one-layer networks, which looks technical sound to me. However, in practice, we could not only use the one-layer network for graph classification, even for a small graph. "}
