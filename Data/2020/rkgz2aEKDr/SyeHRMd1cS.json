Nevertheless, below I try my best to evaluate the technicality of this paper\n\n====================\nIn this work the authors studied the variance issue of the adaptive learning rate and aim to justify the warm-start heuristic. They also demonstrate that  the convergence issue of many of the stochastic gradient descent algorithms is due to large variance induced by the adaptive learning rate in the early stage of training. To tackle this issue, they proposed a variant of ADAM, which is known as rectified ADAM, whose learning rate not only takes the momentum into the account, but it also adapts to the variance of the previous gradient updates.  \n\nIn the first part of the paper, the authors analyzed the variance issue exists in the existing ADAM algorithm, such that with limited samples in the early stage of training, the variance of the adaptive learning rate becomes rather large and it induces high variance to the gradient update to ADAM. In general I found this theoretical justification on the observation of variance issue in ADAM sound, and quite intuitive. In the second part, they proposed the algorithm, namely rectified ADAM, where the difference here to take the second moment  of the gradient into account when updating the adaptive learning rate. They showed that the variance of the adaptive learning rate with such rectification is more numerically stable (especially when variance is intractable in vanilla ADAM), and under some regularity assumption it decreases in the order or O(1/\\rho_t).\n\nIn extensive numerical studies of supervised learning, the authors showed that RADAM achieves a better accuracy than ADAM (although in Table 1, I am a bit puzzled why the best accuracy is indeed from SGD, if so, what's the point of all adaptive learning rates, is that because SGD requires extensive lr tuning?) Because the superiority in accuracy they also showed that RADAM manages to have more stable training and achieves lower training loss, which is quite interesting. \n"}
