For example, NEIL [1], and comparative attributes [2]. So it would be advisable to thoroughly review those related literature.\n\n2) the whole framework is a two pathway encoder-decoder networks. The framework is well explained. It would be great if there are more words about the motivations why the network is designed in such a manner. In general, there is lack of discussion why the attractor networks are novel, and significant. \n\n3) In term of network structure, the loss functions introduced are pretty straight-forward. Please claim novelty about loss functins, if there is anything special.\n\n4) The experiments are pretty weak: Only on two small datasets. It would be great if there are more experiments on larger, or challenging datasets. Considering it\u2019s almost ten pages; I would prefer more persuasive experiments to validate the novelties (but please better summarize the novelty again).\n\n\n\n[1] NEIL: Extracting Visual Knowledge from Web Data. 2012\n\n[2] Constrained Semi-Supervised Learning using Attributes and Comparative Attributes.
