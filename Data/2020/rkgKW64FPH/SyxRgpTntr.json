In particular, they prove several PAC learning-style bounds on the embedding and gradient estimation when using node sampling approaches. They also observe that since the number of nodes selected for sampling is not dependent on the size of the graph, this amounts to a constant time operation for determining embedding and gradient estimates.\n\nImportantly, a variety of existing works have already proposed node sampling (\u201cconstant-time GNNs\u201d), so the contribution of this work lies in the theoretical bounds. A moderate set of experiments suggests the empirical behavior follows the theoretical expectations.\n\nOverall (and described in the comments below), I believe this paper provides some interesting theoretical results for an approach that is widely-used in practice. However, I believe the title and abstract are misleading; this paper does not suggest some new sampling strategy; it only gives a theoretical approximation error for existing approaches and network architectures.\n\nComments\n\nWhile the authors do make this clear later in the paper, the contributions of this work are only the theoretical bounds; the node sampling algorithms have been proposed in existing work. Both the title and abstract are misleading.\n\nStill, the theoretical bounds do provide an interesting understanding of an approach which is commonly used in practice.\n\nIt would be helpful to give the intuition behind the assumptions and proofs. Currently, it is difficult for a non-expert to follow the reasoning and practical implications of much of this work.\n\nCurrently, it is not clear if these results are \u201cconstructive\u201d, in the sense that they do not obviously suggest some new sampling strategy, etc. Of course, it is still interesting to characterize commonly-used practices, but one does wish the theory suggested, say, a better sampling strategy, etc.\n\nTypos, etc.\n\n\u201cr\u201d, the number of sampled nodes, is not defined in the main body of the paper.\n\nThe text in Footnote 1 is a little confusing, in that the text refers to approximating the embedding, while the text in the footnote describes a prediction problem. A reader could easily interpret this to mean that the error on the downstream prediction problem will be bounded (which is not what this work shows).\n\nThe text mentions that O_G (v,i) refers to the i^th \u201cneighborhood\u201d of v. Presumably, this should be \u201cneighbor\u201d.\n\n\u201cwe take\u201d -> \u201cWe take\u201d\n"}
