Like CycleGAN, the method proposed in this paper does not require data to be specifically matched.\n\nThis paper still has the following problems\uff1a\n1\uff09For the time series images, the reason for processing with a single generator is not clearly stated. In CycleGAN, the two transformations use two different generators, respectively, and use the cycle consistency loss to force the results to converge. In the examples presented in this paper, such as Face Aging, it isn't a process that can be reversed. This paper does not explain why the use of a single generator has been effective.\n2\uff09To be more convincing, this article needs to be tested on more baselines. The indicators provided in this article are not objective enough.\n3\uff09This article also does not give the training computational complexity and testing time cost of the proposed method.\n"}
