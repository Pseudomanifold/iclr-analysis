The prototypical example used in the paper is a network to transform seasonal images, where Summer -> Fall -> Winter -> Spring -> Summer -> etc.\n\nI suggest rejecting the paper.\n\nWhile the idea has some merit, it is an interesting premise to train a recurrent generator to create images in multiple domains, I feel as though the experiments are quite lacking.  The primary evidence the method works is Figure 3, for which we see only 4 examples of the method on two tasks.  Looking at the results they don't look all that great and the proposed method is hard to identify as the best. \n\nThe idea doesn't strike me as particular innovative, feeling like a natural extension of the prior work listed.\n\nTable 1 shows the results of a user study with 20 users.  With only 20 users rating 4 examples of each method we get very little power to resolve the best method, and the papers proposed method is selected in aggregate only 26% of the time out of 6 methods, this is hardly a clear winner.  \n\nFigure 4 showing the imputed ages for the generated images doesn't seem that strong of evidence the proposed method is that much better either.  The histograms are difficult to compare by eye, perhaps the paper should report computed estimates of the kl divergence between the two?  \n\nThe ablation studies of section 6 are out of place.  The paper does not compare against the incremental removal of its' proposed loss, it simply reports results of alternative architectures.  "}
