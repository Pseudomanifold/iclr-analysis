This is achieved with a simple modification to CycleGAN training where the training involves additional steps to create a loop. A number of experimental results are shown on specific sequential datasets, comparing to a number of other baselines. On the chosen datasets and tasks, the proposed architecture provides good results over the baselines. However, I would have liked to see ablation studies showing that they achieve the same results as CycleGAN when training on 2 domains. The paper's technical novelty is limited to this simple loop extension and generator sharing. As such, while the experimental results are reasonable, I find this lack of any technical novelty a negative factor. "}
