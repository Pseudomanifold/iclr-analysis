The long descriptions of protein/drug descriptors are a nice overview,  but it may be unnecessary as the authors in the end use other works\u2019 embedding.\n\nThe author points out that there are interpretability issues & the inability to capture the shape of the substructures with previous ligand descriptors, however, it seems that CDDD also is not interpretable and could not capture the shape as it operates on SMILES strings, although seems to have better predictive performance.\n\nFor the protein descriptor, the author is missing several important descriptors that may not have the issues mentioned such as Protein Sequence Composition descriptor. \n\nThe technical novelty is very limited. It seems the usage of CDDD and UniRep are its only difference from previous works such as DeepDTA, WideDTA, DeepConv-DTI, PADME and CDDD and UniRep are also from other works. It may be more suitable for a domain journal instead of ICLR which focuses on method innovation. \n\n\nThe experimental setup is solid with realistic considerations. However, it is missing many baselines such as DeepDTA, WideDTA, DeepConv-DTI, PADME and more classic methods such as SimBoost and KronRLS. "}
