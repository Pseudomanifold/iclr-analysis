Their findings suggest that some hyperparameters, such as the loss being used, can provide substantial improvements to some models, and can be the reason of the significant improvements in neural link prediction accuracy the community observed in recent months.\n\nThis is a really interesting paper, and can really shine some light on what was going on in neural link prediction over recent years. It also provides a great overview of the field -- in terms of architectures, loss functions, regularizers, sampling strategies, data augmentation strategies etc. -- that is really needed right now in the field.\n\nOne concern I have is that the hyperparameter tuning strategy is not really described -- authors just say something along the lines of \"we use av.dev\", but for those unfamiliar with this specific hyperparameter optimiser this does not provide much information (e.g. what is a Sobol sequence? I had to look it up)."}
