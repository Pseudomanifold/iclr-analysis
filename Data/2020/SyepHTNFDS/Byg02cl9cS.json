By constructing the mapping from G to z, GraphNVP first changes the discrete feature vector into continuous variables, then update this matrix representation by scaling and transforming functions (Eq. (2)-(5) in this GRF paper). In each iteration the matrix is only updated by one row (one slice for the tensor), while keep other rows intact. Then for constructing the inverse mapping, we can first sample a random vector and then apply the \u201cinverse\u201d of the update rule to recover the edge matrix and node matrix respectively.\n\nThe main contribution for GRF paper is to find a new update rule from the idea of ResNet. The author thinks that GraphNVP only update one row each time, which is less efficient, and the model can only cover a limited number of mappings. Then he proposed a new function for update (Eq. (6)-(7)), which updates all rows each time. The author shows how to approximate the determinant of the Jacobian matrix, and how to construct the inverse mapping from fixed-point iteration, as the mapping is Lipschitz. Lastly the author shows that GRF uses much less parameters than GraphNVP both theoretically and practically, which means that the new model is more expressive. However, the new model may output the same molecule for several times (shown by \u201cUniqueness\"), and it favors the striaght-chain molecules.\n\nAnother question related to the experiment is that how does the method compared to methods which first generate SMILES string and then convert to molecule graph?
