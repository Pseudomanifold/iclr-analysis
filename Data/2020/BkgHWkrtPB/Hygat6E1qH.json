The authors measure information in the weights of a DNN as the trade-off between network accuracy and weight complexity. They bring out the relationships between Shannon MI and Fisher Information and the connections to PAC-Bayes bound and invariance. The main result is that models of low information generalize better and are invariance-tolerant. \n\nThe paper is very well written and concepts are theoretically-well documented.\n\nIn Definition 3.1 for the \u2018Information in the Weights\u2019, how does the complexity of the task vary with \\beta? Is the Pareto curve provided in the paper? "}
