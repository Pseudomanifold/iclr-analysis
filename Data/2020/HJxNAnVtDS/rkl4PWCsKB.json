The paper is well-written and motivated with good discussions of the algorithm and the related works. The proof techniques involve bounding how much worse can the algorithm do because of non-identical distribution and introduction of stragglers into the standard analysis of SGD-like algorithms. The presented theory is useful, and also provides new insights such as a new sampling scheme and an inherent bias for the case of non-decaying step size. The empirical evaluation is adequate and well-presented. I think this paper is a strong contribution and should spark further discussions in the community. "}
