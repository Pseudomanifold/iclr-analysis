The highlight of the paper is removing the following two assumptions: (i) the data are iid across devices, and (ii) all the devices are active. For smooth and strongly convex problems, the paper proves an O(1/T) convergence rate to global optimum for learning rate decaying like 1/t with time. It is also shown that with constant learning rate eta, the solution found can be necessarily Omega(eta) away from the optimum (for a specific problem instance), thus justifying the decaying learning rate used in the positive result.\n\nFederated learning has been an important and popular research area since it models a highly distributed and heterogeneous learning system in real world. Previous theoretical analysis of FedAvg was quite scarce and either made the iid data assumption or required averaging all the devices. This work is the first to prove a convergence guarantee without these two assumptions. In particular, it only requires averaging a (random) subset of devices each round, which is much more realistic than averaging all.\n\nI don't quite have an intuition for why you need strong convexity. I hope the authors could explain this in words and maybe comment on what are the challenges of removing this assumption."}
