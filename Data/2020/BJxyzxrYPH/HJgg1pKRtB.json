The proposed algorithm is a simple shallow and fully linear network. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. \n\nThe proposed method is new and has been shown good empirical results. The paper also points out a new way to interpret matrix completion. On the other hand, the proposed method seems ad hoc and there is no clear evidence why it is better than other baselines except the empirical results. The paper also has some clearance issues, making it hard to understand. I vote for a weak reject of the paper at the current pace and would like to increase my score if the following questions can be clearly answered.\n\n1.\tWhy do we need to propose the algorithm? Is it because we have the functional maps technique motivated from shape correspondence, and we can see some connection of such technique with matric completion? If it is true, we surely can have a new algorithm based on such a new technique. But I can still not understand why the method work, at least, in an intuitive way.\n2.\tWhat is the sample complexity of the proposed matrix completion algorithm? \nThe introduction of the paper is poorly written. The first paragraph and the third one both contain some introduction to matric completion, which results in a lot of redundant information. The second paragraph and the fourth one are redundant in the same way since they both focus on geometric matrix completion. I think besides introducing what is matrix completion and what is geometric completion, the introduction part should focus more on the motivation to propose the algorithm. However, I can only see from the end of the second paragraph (some simple models need to be proposed) and the fifth paragraph (\u201cThe inspiration of our paper\u201d) some motivation information. The introduction part needs to be re-organized to provide more useful information about the paper rather than a literature review.\n\nThere is some unclear/inaccurate/subjective statement in the introduction part. For example, \u201cSelf-supervised learning\u201d needs a reference. Why geometric matrix completion generalizes the standard deep learning approaches is not clear. What does it mean by \u201ctheir design is \u2026 cumbersome and non-intuitive\u201d? The shape correspondence is never explained until very later in the paper.  Also, there are some unclear issues besides the Introduction part. For example, what does it mean by \u201cthe product graph\u201d? All these issues need to be clarified before the paper can be accepted. \n"}
