I think this is very interesting work that could have a lot of impact in vision and beyond, since effective construct the problem in reconstruction tasks are highly relevant to a number of tasks. I was initially quite excited about this paper, but as I drilled into the details of this work. \n\nFor the manifold modeling, though the authors defined each part of the formulation in equations (1)-(5), but it is not clear how to design corresponding efficient structures for different low-level problems. In other words, the application ability is not clear. For example, if the proposed MMES scheme is used in image deconvolution tasks, how to design the corresponding structure?\n\nFor the parameters, there is no description of the parameters set in subsection 4.2 and 4.3. And what are the criteria for selecting these parameters?\n\nFor the experimental part, the comparison experiments in subsection 4.1(Toy examples) and subsection 4.3 (Color image superresolution) lack comparisons with the latest methods. I think, more comparison experiments should be provided. \n"}
