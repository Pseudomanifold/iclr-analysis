This is done through: a) temporal adversarial learning, b) Ping Pong loss, and c) metrics that quantify the quality. The methods are evaluated on two datasets and user studies.\n\nThe idea is interesting and the paper is well written. The results are convincing.\n\nThe originality of the concatenation of several frames is somewhat limited, since it is a standard procedure in other domains such as robotics. Nevertheless the results are positive.\n\nSeems like the metrics definitions were not included in the main body of the paper - the authors should either include them to remove from the contributions.
