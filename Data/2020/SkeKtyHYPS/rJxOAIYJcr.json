Based on the SSIM metric (which is shown to be a better metric than PSNR), different noise level on a set of different kinds of noise are explored. Experimental results on two sub-datasets of ImageNet suggest that Speckle noise would lead to better CNN models.\n\nEven though the simulations appear seemingly convincing, and the conclusion is somewhat interesting to me: speckle noise is recommended which contradicts the general usage of Gaussian noise. The results is too specific to both the model chosen resnet18v2 and also in the chosen dataset. Besides, my bigger concern is that the contribution of this work is highly limited, since there are a bunch of data augmentation techniques: cropping, flipping, color space transformation, rotation, noise injection, etc. Given this broad selection of data augmentation, as far as I know, noise injection is not the most effective nor popular one.  In fact, random cropping is the mostly used one that established past a few benchmark CNN models in the imageNet classification task, e.g, ResNet, DenseNet, etc. As such, it would be more convincing if it can be shown that proper noise injection can boost the recognition performance on the ImageNet task. \n\nMinors:\nAbstract line 8, and also introduces -> and also introduce   "}
