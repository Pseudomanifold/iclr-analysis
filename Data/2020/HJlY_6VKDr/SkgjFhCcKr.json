In Sec 2., the authors only mention the FGSM in White-box Attacks. It is widely accepted that when evaluating the white-box attacks, you should at least test PGD attacks and/or C&W attacks.\n\n2. When you try to propose an adversarial defense, you should report the performance under white-box adaptive attacks. Only claiming effectiveness under black-box attacks is not informative or convincing.\n\nThe experiment results are also weird. For example, in Figure 8, why the Vanilla clean accuracy on CIFAR-10 is only 88.35%? Besides, the clean accuracy on CIFAR-10 of 2-Networks Buzz is 75%, 8-Networks Buzz is 60%. This clean performance is not acceptable, no matter how robust is the model."}
