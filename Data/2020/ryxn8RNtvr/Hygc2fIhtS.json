It is an interesting work that tries to propose a simple yet effective interpretable model. I am not familiar with this research direction, and I try to make an educated guess.\n\nPros:\n-- As the author suggested, the method is simple and effective.\n-- The authors conducted user studies to demonstrate that the results generated by their proposed method is strongly favored over previous methods.\n\nCons:\n-- Subscripts in equations need improvement to make them consistent. For example, in Equation (7), we have E_{y}, but in Equation (8), we have E_{Y_j} and E_{Y_k}.\n-- Section 4, Figure 3, top, it seems obvious to choose the fourth one to distinguish the number 9? I feel this example is too easy and not convincing enough."}
