I think this is an ambitious study and find the employed experimental methods interesting. \n\nHowever, it is not clear to me what has been actually revealed by this study. \n\nIn the last section, there is a statement \u201cthe model adequately predicts human sampling behavior and reaches almost human-level performance in this contextual reasoning task.\u201d I think that at least the first half is overstatement; it is not well validated by the experimental results.\n\nFor instance, contrary to the authors\u2019 claim, I do not think the effectiveness of the recurrent connections in ClickNet is sufficiently validated. I think a yet another baseline is missing in the experiments, which is a strategy of clicking points in the periphery of the black box while avoiding (or minimizing) overlaps of the regions deblurred by previous clicks. \n\nAlthough ClickNet-RandPrior appears to be close to this strategy, it does not seem to use any constraint of avoiding such region overlap. On the other hand, in the training of ClickNet, a constraint \\sum_t\\alpha_{ti}=1 is used, which seems to play this very role, i.e., making it possible for ClickNet to avoid the region overlap. Isn\u2019t the good performance of ClickNet fully attributable to this constraint?\n\nThe proposed method is to make subjects (or ClickNet) click a series of points in the input image and then deblur the local regions around the points. I suppose this procedure is accumulative, that is, once a local region is deblurred, it will be kept deblurred in the subsequent clicks. Then, I'm not sure if the order of clicking points really matters, whether it is a human subject or the ClickNet. For instance, is there any evidence that a click is dependent on the previous clicks, other than the above behavior of avoiding overlaps?\n\nAdditionally, I am somewhat skeptical if a pretrained VGG can really extract useful features from (partially) blurred images, even though it is not trained on blurred images. It is widely known that CNNs for visual recognition tasks are vulnerable to image blur, noise, etc. when they do not exist in the images used for training, which is a kind of domain shift. \n"}
