The proposed method is based on domain adversarial training strategies, especially that of (Ganin et al., 2016), where the adversarial component is modified from \u201closs of distinguishing between the source and target domains\u201d to \u201cthe squared Pearson correlation between the ground truth bias covariate and its estimation from the learned representation\u201d. This design is based on the argument that the ultimate goal of bias control here is removing statistical association with respect to the bias variables, as opposed to maximizing the prediction error of them.\n\nThings to improve the paper that did not impact the score:\n\t- Introduction, line 4: Wrong citation format: use of \\citet instead of \\citep.
