(2018), as a means of enabling emergent communication, and adds an auxiliary task to demonstrate that this helps with language emergence. The auxiliary task is to enable the speaker to predict the hidden state of the listener, after the message has been received. This is (not unreasonably) likened to providing the speaker with some empathy, in that it enables the speaker to try and predict what the effect of the message will be on the listener.\n\nThe main result is that the learning exhibits a speed-up, arriving at roughly the same level of overall reward but in fewer training steps.\n\nThe idea of adding an \"empathy\" auxiliary task to the reference-game setup is an interesting one, and the approach is well-motivated and described, including a background section. Unfortunately, however, the contributions of the paper are some way off what would be required for a full ICLR paper. Note that the main experimental results section takes up only 1/3 of a page, and the overall paper has only 5 pages of content. (As far as I know there is no requirement for an ICLR paper to take up the whole 8 pages, but a submission with only 5 pages is quite unusual.) So the overall contribution could be summarised as taking an existing emergent-language setup with the same speaker and listener neural architectures; adding a single MLP to the speaker; and showing two graphs of training reward, varying the number of candidates (2 and 5). I hope that the authors can perhaps see that this submission would be better suited to a dedicated workshop on emergent communication (and even then it would need more experiments and analysis).\n"}
