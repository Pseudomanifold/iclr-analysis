The authors propose an approach to introduce the notion of empathy to multi-agent deep RL by extending existing approaches on referential games with an auxiliary task for the speaker to predict the listener\u2019s empathy/mind. Experiments show that this gives some improvement with faster convergence.\n\nStrengths:\n- The concept is interesting and grounded in human communication.\n\nWeaknesses:\n- I like the motivation of predicting empathy, but the paper vastly oversells this part: I don't see how predicting the listener's hidden state is the same as modeling empathy. Empathy is a complex human state/emotion that should not be reduced to this.\n- This paper is very preliminary. There are multiple typos in the paper. Figures are not professionally created. There are multiple training details not included such as how the agents are modeled and trained. The authors seem to have run out of time given the short length of the paper.\n- The experimental results are not convincing at all. The improvement is too small and it would help to run the experiment multiple times to see the improvement with respect to variance in the model. There should also be experiments testing the effect of \\alpha on performance. There is no analysis of how well the model is able to predict empathy, as well as ablation studies testing for various design decisions. The authors should also add an analysis of the learned communication protocols and whether they are different in a meaningful way."}
