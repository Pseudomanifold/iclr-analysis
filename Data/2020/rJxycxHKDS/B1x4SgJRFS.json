The motivation is clear, related work\nsufficient and experimental settings and results convincing. \nI have only very minor comments:\n- I would prefer to get the paper additionally linked to a few more\n  transfer learning techniques out of the deep learning domain\n  which is important as well\n- do you really need to call it (multi) flow network .... - a flow network\n  is a well established concept in algorithmics and refers to a graph problem\n  ... to avoid name clashes ...\n- in the references you have provided back links to the pages where the references\n  are used - this is handy but also confusing and a bit unusual - I think it was not part \n  of the standard template\n- please avoid using arxiv references but replace them by reviewed material. In parts\n  I am willing to accept such kind of gray literature provided by well known authors but\n  this should not become a standard habit\n- I am happy to see that the code will be published - I hope this is really done, because\n  from the material it maybe hard to reconstruct the method"}
