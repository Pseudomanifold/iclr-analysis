Using this result, they propose a number of methods to create stochastic trust region methods by constructing approximate quadratic models (based on a stochastic first and second order estimate) which satisfy the requirements for convergence. The effectiveness of the derived methods is evaluated empirically on two standard non-convex regression problems.\n\nThis paper is overall an interesting contribution which proposes a number of competitive methods for achieving approximate local minima in a stochastic regime, with both hessian based and \u201chessian-free\u201d methods. A couple of minor points:\n- In the experiments, it would be helpful to also include some measure of uncertainty (such as standard error bars) in the plots given the stochastic nature of the problem (although I do not expect high variance given the construction of the algorithm).\n- It would be helpful to indicate which results still hold in the online setting (not finite sum). Indeed, from the proof of theorem 3.1, MetaAlgorithm 1 does not seem to rely on the finite sum setting, which is mostly used for analyzing the variance-reduced estimators. This would be helpful as it would enable MetaAlgorithm 1 to be used with appropriate variance-reduced estimators in settings beyond the finite-sum problems.\n"}
