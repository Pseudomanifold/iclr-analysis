The first algorithm STR1 has lower second order oracle complexity, while STR2 has lower first order + second order oracle complexity. The authors also give a Hessian-free implementation of stochastic trust region algorithm. Technically, the authors first analyze trust region methods with inexact gradient and Hessian estimation, and then implement efficient gradient and Hessian estimators. \n\nOverall this paper is well-written and easy to follow. I would recommend acceptance. "}
