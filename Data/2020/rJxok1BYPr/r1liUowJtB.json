The authors extend existing methods for improving molecules by applying them recursively over multiple rounds, and show that it is beneficial for optimizing logP but not QED. An advantage over existing methods is that the trajectory of optimized molecules is interpretable. Altogether, I find the paper borderline: it is clearly written but the methodological contribution is incremental, some citations to related work missing, and some parts of the results section are weak. Detailed comments below.\n\nMajor comment\n============\n1. Framing optimizing as a sequence to sequence problem is not new. As described in the related work section, the BBRT is closely related to Jin et al. However, it is not clearly described what the major improvement over Jin et al is. Please clarify \u2018their inference method restricts the framework\u2019s application to more general problems.\u2019.  The method is also closely related to Zou et al (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-47148-x) and Mueller et al (http://proceedings.mlr.press/v70/mueller17a.html), which are not cited in the text. Zou et al used RL to learn to optimize molecules by mutating existing molecules. Mueller et al used Seq2Seq to optimize the sentiment of sentences. Please cite these papers and discuss why BBRT is better.\n\n2. Please compare to ChemBO (http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.01425). The current baselines are one-shot in that they are proposing a batch of molecules once without using the acquired target function label to propose subsequent batches. ChemBO optimizes a target function such as logP over multiple rounds similar to recursive BBRT approach, and should therefore be included as a baseline. Another suitable baseline would be performing BO in the latent space by applying Gomez et Bombarelli recursively (embed molecule; optimize GP in embedding space; decode molecule; iterate).\n\n3. The method names (Graph2Graph, Seq2Seq, R-Graph2Graph, R-Seq2Seq, BBRT-JTNN, \u2026) are not defined in section 5.1-baselines, and used inconsistently. Is JTNN the same as Graph2Graph and does BBRT mean recursive (R-)? This makes is hard to follow the results section.\n\n4. Section 5.1: How does the performance depends on the initial seed of sequences? How sensitive is it i) to the choice of the diversity cutoff, and ii) to the target value of the initial molecules? \n\n5. Fig 4a, right: Is is expected that logP increases fastest when using it as a scoring function. Please show instead QED vs. the number of iterations. QED combines several molecular properties, including logP, and is therefore more suited for quantifying drug likeness.\n\n6. \u2018Differences between logP and QED.\u2019 I do not understand this section. Please clarify the goal of an explorative vs interpolative task? Are molecules with the highest QED in the training dataset? Motivate why BBRT does not achieve a higher QED in table 1?\n\n7. \u2018The distinction in the vocabulary highlights the usefulness \u2026\u2019. Is the conclusion that representing molecules as sequences is better than representing them as graphs? This would contradict several recent papers on graph-based representations. You are only comparing the top molecules. Is there a significant difference in the complexity between the top 100 (for example) molecules?\n\n8. Section 5.3 is verbose and can shortened to a few sentences saying that applying edits to molecules recursively makes the model interpretable. How do traces look like when logP is used a  selection criteria? How does the trace of the best molecule shown in figure 3 look like? What is the average edit distance between molecules are and intermediate molecules valid? Are transitions plausible?\n\n9. Section 5.4: You are optimizing a single objective (e.g. logP) while reporting in parallel a second objective (e.g. QED). This is not multi-objective optimization, where multiple objectives are optimized in parallel. Optimizing a single objective while reporting a second objective can be also done with methods other than BBRT. Please clarify the take-away message of this paragraph or remove it.\n\n\nMinor comments\n=============\n10. Introduction: \u2018discrete and unstructured\u2019. Why unstructured? I would say that molecules are structured--they must follow a certain grammar to be valid.\n\n11. Introduction: \u2018treating inference as a first class citizen\u2019 is unclear since \u2018inference\u2019 is undefined. Either remove this sentence or clarify.\n\n12. Please discuss that BBRT is limited by the need of a labeled dataset for constructing training pairs.\n\n13. Section 5.1, \u2018Similar computational budget\u2019. How did you quantify the computation budget?\n\n14. Section 5.1, \u2018In Fig 2, we report\u2019. Do you mean Fig 3? Same as with \u2018Fig 3\u2019 in the following paragraph."}
