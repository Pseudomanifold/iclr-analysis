The method is applied to the problem of estimating the age based on faces. Extensions proposed are the learning of multiple disjoint chains on this dataset, manually partitioned or learned through an iterative assignment algorithm that has similarities with a soft expectation-maximization principle. Extensive experiments are done on the age estimation problem with comparison to exisiting approaches, and an application to aesthetic assessment is proposed in appendix.\n\nThe paper is very well written and contains very extensive and relevant experiments. I only have minor concerns:\n\n1) I couldn't find the explanation for the underlined numbers in Table 2.\n2) It would be good to include the details of Appendix C in the text, as is, it looks like an artificial space saving trick.\n3) typo in Section 3.2: \"we assume that the chain, to which the instance belong, is known\" -> \"we assume that the chain to which the instance belongs is known\""}
