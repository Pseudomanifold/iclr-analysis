They show their results in nine different datasets, and their survival curves are similar to the original survival curves while protecting patient privacy.\n\nThere have been a number of survival functions with differential privacy discussion since Nguyen and Hui. Please check other papers that cite it.\n\nOverall, the writing is choppy, where ideas that should be a single sentence is separated into multiple sentences. For example, in the first few sentences of the Introduction, we have \"An adversary, with only access to the published estimates... Effectively leading to the disclosure of sensitive information\", which should just be a single sentence. There are many instances of this throughout the paper, and they should be edited prior to re-submission.\n\nThe authors claim that GANs do not work well for their application, but it would be more convincing if there are citations or experiments tha t can back this up.\n\nThe authors write that their method \"provides good utility\". They should explicitly state the metric of evaluation, as well as the increase in performance clearly in both the abstract and the introduction.\n\nSection 2.1 introducing the survival function is not necessary. Maybe just 2-3 sentences on the K-M estimator."}
