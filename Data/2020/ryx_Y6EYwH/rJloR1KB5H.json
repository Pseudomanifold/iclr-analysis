An Extension for the competing risk cumulative incidence function is also presented. Experiments on nine datasets are presented.\n\nThe algorithm is simple, readily extends to KM's confidence interval, the logrank test statistic and the competing risk cumulative function. Theoretical results follow from the count nature of the data (number of events and risk set size).\n\nFrom the experiments it is noticeable that the the differentially private estimator consistently overestimates risk (see Figure 1 nad Table 2, left) and the logrank test statistic (table 2, right). This is not addressed in the paper.\n\nThe work, although interesting, is of very limited value to the ICLR community."}
