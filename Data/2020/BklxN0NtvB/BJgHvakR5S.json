To mitigate this loss, the authors propose a method that combines the method of \"noise injection and \"knowledge distillation\". However, from a conceptual point of view,  their contribution (i.e. (10) in Section 5,) is unclear to me. Specifically,  the authors are not precise about how do they merge the aforementioned previous ideas and come up with the new loss function (10). \n\nMinor comment: Please correct (7).\n\n\n"}
