Specifically, Convolutional Iterative Soft Thresholding Algorithm (CISTA) is introduced to solve CSC problem and state-of-the-art performance is achieved on popular benchmarks.\n\n[Strengths]\n- This paper is well-written and easy to follow.\n\n[Weaknesses]\n- My main concern on this work is its novelty seems to be limited. In Introduction, the authors raised 4 kinds of issues, including framework/optimization/memory/multi-scale. However, optimization and memory issues are mitigated by the CNN architectures; multi-scale issue is addressed with the help of work from Kim et al.. It seems the proposed questions are mostly addressed by the previous methods.\n\n- It seems CISTA may be the main novelty of this work. However, no comparasions with previous ISTA methods (e.g., [R1-3]) are conducted and discussed. \n\n- From Tabs. 2&3, the improvement is very limited. Besides, time complexity needs to be compared with the competitors, including flops or inference times.\n\n[R1] A Fast Proximal Method for Convolutional Sparse Coding, IJCNN 2013.\n[R2] Convolutional Neural Networks Analyzed via Convolutional Sparse Coding, JMLR 2017.\n[R3] On Multi-Layer Basis Pursuit, Efficient Algorithms and Convolutional Neural Networks, TPAMI 2018."}
