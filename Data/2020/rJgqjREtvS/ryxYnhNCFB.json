This is not true,\nthere exist online approaches such as https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.09563\nor distributed methods https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.09235.\n\nThe use of an unfolding algorithm similar to LISTA is\nnot clearly motivated and explained, especially concerning\nthe training procedure when working in the SR context.\n\nFinally the latex formatting suffers from many issues and typos.\nBe careful with difference between \\citet and \\citep for citations.\n\nFonts in figure 4 are too small\n"}
