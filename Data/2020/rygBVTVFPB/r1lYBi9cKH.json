Under the MDP assumption, the author sets the initial state of the particles as the current state, the flux at all spaces as the possible actions, and map the state-action pair deterministically to the next state of the particle diffusion. The reward is defined as the two norms between the prediction and the Burger\u2019s equation. The naiveness comes from the fact that the typical reinforcement learning problem, the agent needs to decide how to choose an action. In this paper, it is formulated as an intrinsic proper that follows Burger\u2019s equation instead. \n\nWhile the motivation is interesting, the author argues this work is novel due to it does not fall under supervised learning, but rather reinforcement learning. This perspective is not completely correct. The correct category for this work would be more similar to imitation learning using WANO\u2019s algorithm as the expert label. This is a field of supervised reinforcement learning.\n\nThe author\u2019s work has brought the possibility of using neural network architecture in the field of particle diffusion. The benefit is the improved estimation of how particles diffuse in long-horizon conditions. The author has shown in their paper their simple fully connected network has already performed better prediction than the current state of the art non-neural network model: WENO.\n\nWhile the framing of the problem is perhaps novel in the space of PDE, algorithmically there needs to have a breakthrough or new invention. The lack of comparison with other neural-network-based models also hurts the credibility of the model. Therefore, I reject this paper under the ICLR conference. I would suggest that this paper would be better suited as a paper submission under the perspective science field conference instead.\n\nSome suggestions to further improve this paper: The author could add CNN and RNN structure to the prediction model. These structures would further expand other possibilities in the solution space. CNN would help turn the limited 1D problem to a higher-dimensional, a more real-world like problem space. RNN is known for its\u2019 ability to model long horizon problems, perhaps even better breakthrough would happen with these architectures.\n\nAs a whole, the paper is written very well such that even nonexpert can grab onto the logic flow of this paper. The weaknesses of the paper are the lack of diversity in comparison with other models and the paper needs some level of novel breakthrough in an algorithmic sense.\n"}
