The contributions summarize the most fundamental works of RL but do not really relate these methods to the proposed approach. Therefore, I am still uncertain about the general motivation and intention of the work as well as the evaluation. Currently I vote for borderline reject as I am familiar with RL & PDE'S but do not understand the motivation and intention. I am leaning towards rejection as the paper is a resubmission from Neurips and has not been substantially improved. However, I am not certain about my evaluation. I am happy to adapt my vote based on the other reviewers and a clarified and better structured paper, which can be submitted during the rebuttal."}
