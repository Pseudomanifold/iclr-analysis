There are 3 ways to mitigate forgetting: 1. architectrual approaches, 2. regularization approaches, 3. memory approaches. The authors focus on the second one, that is, reguarization approaches. In order to mitigate catastrophic forgetting problem, L_2 strategies was proposed previously. In this paper, they use L_1 strategy instead. I think the mothod is not novel, which does not reach the level of ICLR."}
