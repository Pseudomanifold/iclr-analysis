It predicts the image rotationangle conditioned on the candidate image class. Experimental evaluations show that CRAP achieves superior performance over the other existing\nways of combining SlfSL and SemSL. \n\nOverall I feel that the paper is not pleasant to read and leaves the reader a lot of unclearities. For example, if the task consdiered using the benchmark image data sets classification, then why and where do you need to estimate the rotation angle; is rotation needed in augmenting the training data set; what is the relation between the image classification task and the estimation of image rotation angles?\n\nIn equation 1, is you have already been able to estimate p(y|x,theta), then why bother estimating the other term since you final goal is exactly the semi-supervised learning task of estimating the probability of the label y for each sample x? The authors claimed that the p(z|x,theta) term will also back propagate to p(y|x,theta). does it depend on the pre-task chosen?\n\nIn figure~1, why do you have multiple sematic classifiers? \n\nEstimating the joint conditional distribution p(z|x,y,theta) can be considered as  creating an ensemble of diversified pretext target predictors, as authors discussed. However, the prediction requires summation over y, namely differen sample classes --- how can we consider each term as a base classifier if it is only related to one class?\n\nOverall the paper is very difficult to understand and authors can definitely improve their presentation, and in particular spend more effort explaining things in a coherent and clear manner. \n "}
