The idea seems quite novel, but the presentation seems to be more complicated than it needs to be for the idea. For example the introduction is quite hard to parse and when you get down to it, the ideas don\u2019t seem that complex.\n\nThe discussion of the technique seems to be lacking in detail. I would be hard-pushed to reproduce the work from the material presented.\n\nFigure 2 is complex and lacks enough discussion in the text.\n\nFigure 3 is likewise complex and is not mentioned at all in the text.\n\nFigure 4 needs more discussion.\n\nThe results presented are quite minimal and don\u2019t fully explore and evaluate the approach taken.\n\nSpecific issues:\n- Page 2: broken citation: \u201cstate space [cite], \u201c\n\n- \u201cLightbot: The Lightbot domain \u2026 a positive reward of only if it successfully turns off all lights.\u201d - this seems to be the opposite of all previous statements which talked about Turing lights on.\n\n- \u201cWe also model each Fractal Lightbot puzzle \u2026 and a reward of 100 for successfully transferring the tower of disks.\u201d - this sounds more like the reward for the tower."}
