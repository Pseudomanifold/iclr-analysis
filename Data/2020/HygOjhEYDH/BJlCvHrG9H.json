To increase the expressiveness of the resulting model, the parameters of these conditional distributions are made to be dependent on histories and additional input features through a RNN network, updating at discrete event occurrences.\n\nThe paper is very well written and easy to follow. I also like the fact that it is probably among the first of those trying to integrate neural networks into TPPs to look at directly modeling inter-event intervals, which offers a different perspective and potentially also opens doors for many new methods to come.\n\nI have just three comments/questions.\n\n1. The log-normal mixture model has a hyper-parameter K. Similarly, DSFlow also has K, and SOSFlow has K and R. How are these hyper-parameters selected? I don't seem to find any explanation in the paper (not even in appendix F.1)?\n\n2. To better demonstrate that a more complicated (e.g. multi-modal) inter-event interval distribution is necessary and can really help with data modeling, I'd be interested to see e.g. those different interval distributions (learnt from different models) being plotted against each other (sth. similar to Figure 8, but with actual learnt distributions), and preferably with some meaningful explanations as to e.g. how the additional modes capture or reflect what we know about the data.\n\n3. Even though the current paper mainly focuses on inter-event interval prediction, I think it's still helpful to also report the  model's prediction accuracy on marks in a MTPP. The \"Total NLL\" in Table 5 is one step towards that, but a separate performance metric on mark prediction alone would have been even clearer."}
