Different from existing ones using graph kernel, or graph2vec, the proposed InfoGraph is able to extract graph-level representation with fixed-length features that are generalized well. Basically, InfoGraph is parameterized by graph neural networks, but guided by mutual information loss. Experiments on both unsupervised and semi-supervised experiments on popular benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of InfoGraph and InfoGraph*\n\n*  The paper is well written and easy to follow, and the research problem is of great value in different fields.\n\n* In general, the novelty of this paper is ok, but it\u2019s partially based on Deep InfoMax (DIM) published recently. This may undermine the novelty of this paper somehow.\n\n* Authors change the fonts in equation from italic to non-italic in Eq. (6), please make sure to use one format throughout the paper.\n\n* Why Jensen-Shannon MI estimator is used in Eq. (5) instead of other estimators for MI, and any more explanations or motivations here?\n\n* Eq. (7) and (8) in facts jointly optimize between two networks \\phi and \\varphi, but little details about the optimization have been exposed. Also, we are not sure if the loss from the two models can converge finally. Better to show some qualitative results and analysis.\n\n* READOUT seems to play a critical role in building the global representation, however, it is unclear if other READOUT function will work well, and why the current one is feasible. Please explain.\n\n* In semi-supervised setting, it seems InfoGraph* is comparable to the SOTA MeanTeachers model on 12 targets. I am not sure if this can reflect the true performance of the proposed model. Maybe another dataset will be able to highlight the superiority.\n"}
