The paper considers 1620 languages and the final dataset contains 135M parallel sentences. The language pairs are general and therefore the data does not require the use of English as a common language between two other languages.\n\nTo evaluate the quality of the extracted pairs, a neural machine translation system has been trained on them and tested on the TED dataset, obtaining good results in terms of BLEU score.\n\nThe article provides information on the system used to extract parallel sentences and opens up different directions for future investigations.\n\nThe dataset seems, from the given details, useful. However, without access to the data and, more importantly, extensive testing of it, it is difficult to say how and how much it would help the advancement of the field. For the moment it seems to be good. However, I am not really sure that this paper could be of interest to a wide audience, except for those involved in machine translation.\n\nIn general, the article describes everything at a high level, without going into the real details.\nAn example of this is on page 6, section 4.2, where the article says that its purpose is to compare different mining parameters, but I do not see any real comparison. Some words are spent for the mining threshold, but there is no real comparison, while other possible parameters are not considered at all.\n\nFor this reason, I would tend to give a low score, which does not mean that the dataset is not good. It means that the real content of the paper seems to me to be too little to be published at ICLR, since the paper only informs about the presence of this new dataset, saying that it contains a large number of sentences and seems to allow good translations based on the results of a preliminary test.\n\nTypos:\n- on page 9 \"Aragonse\"\n- on page 9, end penultimate line, the word \"for\" is repeated."}
