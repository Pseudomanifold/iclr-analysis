The proposed method combines graph embeddings and clustering to intelligently select new node samples. Theoretical analysis is provided to support the effectiveness and experimental results shows that this method can outperform many other active learning methods.  \nThis paper can be improved on the following aspects:\n1.\tThe proposed method conducts clustering using node embeddings. Although these embeddings have encoded graph structure to some extent, I would suggest explicitly incorporating the graph structure in clustering or at least comparing to a baseline on that. The proposed method conducts embedding learning and clustering in two consecutive but separate steps. It would be interesting to see that the clustering can also leverage the graph information.\n2.\tIt would be better to provide more details about network settings (some hyperparams have already been given in the paper), and more analysis would be helpful. For example, how the number of clusters affects the performance? \n3.\tIs it possible to create a scenario where there are more labeled data from one cluster but less data from another cluster? In this case, should we still take equal amount of samples from different clusters?\n"}
