For theorem 1, how is the Hoeffding applied so that the \\sqrt{n} term appears? My worry is naively applying Hoeffding as is done in the proof only gives a bound on a fixed model, but in the theorem A_t is not fixed. You may need to apply a union bound or more sophisticated set cover theory to claim the result. Or if I missed something could the authors add more details on the step using Hoeffding bound to the proof?\n\nOther than that I also feel the assumptions on theorem 1 are way too strong. Especially assumption 2 and 3. They are simply not true in application. The assumptions are so strong that the theorem, even if the proof can be fixed, is not interesting any more.\n"}
