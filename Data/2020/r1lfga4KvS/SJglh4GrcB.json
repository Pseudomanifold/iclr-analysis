GEV k-means and GPD k-means are proposed as two kind of  Extreme Value k-means. A method for accelerating Euclidean distance computation has also been proposed to solve the bottleneck of k-means.\nThe proposed idea is novel and the paper is well written. Experimental reaultts are also good to me.\nThere are two concerns which I need the authors to address:\n1. Since the authors claim that they propose to speed up the computation of the Euclidean distances in k-means. However, there is no time cost comparison in the experiments.\n2. Some other variants of k-means should be added for experimental comparison."}
