Extreme value theory can better capture the data distribution and thus better handle non-convex situations. Experiments on extensive datasets are conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\nThe paper is well written and easy to understand. However there are some concerns:\n1. There are many clustering methods based on geodesic distance of data points (manifold learning), which are supposed to be better at capturing the non-convex data distribution. Comparisons are suggested.\n2. The datasets used in the experiments are relatively small (n<=50000, and k<=10), what about more clusters?\n3. The results of different methods may be unstable to initialization, more tests and average results are suggested.\n\n"}
