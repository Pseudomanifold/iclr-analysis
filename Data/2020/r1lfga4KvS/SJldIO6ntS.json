The paper in its current form is extremely difficult to follow. I highlight some of the difficulty: \n\n1. The notion of \u201cclustering ability\u201d of k-means is not well defined in the paper. So, in general there does not seem to be a clear theoretical objective that is being optimised by the suggested algorithm.\n\n2. The algorithm itself is not clear. For example, the block maximum sequence M^j = {M_1, \u2026, M_m} is not clearly understood. What is threshold u_j? \n\nGiven the above, I am unable to evaluate the contribution of the paper. It will help the paper if the authors clearly formalise what is it that they are trying to achieve with their algorithm. After this, there needs to be a much more clear description of the algorithm. I think the above will also help decide whether section 3.2 on Extreme Value Theory is really required for the discussion. \n"}
