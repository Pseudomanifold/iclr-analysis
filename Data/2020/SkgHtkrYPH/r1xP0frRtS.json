Overall the intuitions are reasonable and the experiments show that the methods and rules of the kernel operations are providing some advantages. This ideas used in the paper doesn't seem to be novel, however, I am not knowledgeable enough to rebut or provide existing work references. The paper doesn't compare the sparse results with other sparsity methods."}
