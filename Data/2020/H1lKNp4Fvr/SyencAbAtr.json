To that end, a model is proposed consisting of three convolutional feature extraction layers only. As this makes it impossible to capture global context, dilated convolutions with varying dilations are applied to the extracted features in parallel and concatenated. Finally, a fusion module implemented via channel attention is applied.\n\nI found this paper lacking in terms of contributions. While the motivation for retaining detailed feature information makes sense for the task in question, it is not clear why it requires replacing the ResNet feature extraction with a very shallow network; an alternative would be to add skip-connections originating from lower levels. Both dilated convolutions and the fusion module are not novel. The paper addresses the need for a fusion module in great detail. However, the insight that a large dilation on top of features computed from a limited receptive field will result in a non-continuous receptive field is a rather trivial one. Hence I don't see the need for section 4.3.1 and 4.3.2, as well as the somewhat complicated deduction in appendix A. The individual modules are ablated, but what about the number of layers for feature extraction? Why settle for 3 rather than 1, 2, or 4?\n\nThe paper does compare against other methods for stereo matching, but I was wondering why the KTTI leader-board excerpt does not include the better results from http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_scene_flow.php?benchmark=stereo ? The result tables are also hard to parse as bold numbers do not correspond to best performance. The conclusion claims that the proposed shallow architecture exhibits \"lower training difficulty\" but I did not see any support for this in the experiments.\n\nOverall, I think that this paper should be rejected on the basis of insufficient contributions."}
