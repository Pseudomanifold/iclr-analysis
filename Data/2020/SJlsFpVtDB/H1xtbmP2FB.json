Summary:\nThis proposes considers neural networks training with non-stationary streaming data. To address online inference, the paper uses variational online updates and a running memory (coreset) summarising the data points seen so far, as recently used in the variational continual learning approach. First, the paper identifies a gap in this recent approach that coreset point selection process does not take into account the approximation quality. The paper develops a sound procedure to select the memory points, essentially to identify \u201cdifficult\u201d data points under the current posterior and put them into the running memory. Second, to handle \u201cconcept drift\u201d, the paper considers imposing some decaying on the likelihood of past data and derives post-hoc variational posterior updates for this case. Two contributions are validated on some streaming regression and classification tasks.\n\n2. Opinion and rationales\n\nI\u2019m leaning towards \u201caccept\u201d for this paper since it presents two interesting contributions (albeit of incremental novelty)  to the approximate inference area, it has clear execution and super clean presentation, and the experiments clearly demonstrate the values of the proposed approaches.\n\nI would like the paper to clarify the following:\n\na. I find the objective for selecting memory points interesting, but am wondering if using individual predictability terms by themselves are good enough to select these points. Perhaps, after some thoughts, memory is perhaps not the right word to characterise these points. \n\nIt seems to me (i) these terms indicate how well the current posterior predicts the data points and thus this objective will tend to favour points with low predictive likelihood to be selected. That is, these points are important when *all other points* are presented, (ii) there will be *no diversity* in the memory as illustrated in the 2d classification example.\n\nThis means the points selected here have quite different characteristics compared to coreset points or the full dataset in general. Coreset points ideally can compactly represent the full dataset and can be used for inference in place of the full dataset.\n\nThat said, the contribution presented here is very useful. Just that I\u2019m not sure how well this will work in more challenging continual learning set-up where diversity is important for a long sequence of diverse tasks.\n\nb. The paper presents a post-hoc modification to approximate posterior (\u2018s mean and variance) to account for the decay in the likelihood contribution from past data. I wonder if this post-hoc adjustment is identical to running approximate inference with the adjusted likelihood?\n\nc. the adaptation parameters need to be tuned/known in advance, which seems to be a disadvantage of the current approach. Is the update presented here somewhat robust to mis-specification of these parameters? How would these be tuned in a more practical setting in which data arrive sequentially and we might not know the underlying \u201cconcept\u201d.\n\n3. Minor details:\n\nProxys -> proxies\n"}
