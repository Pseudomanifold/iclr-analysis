The authors develop a semi-supervised training scheme to fully exploit the value of large amount of unlabeled face images from unconstrained photo collections. Experimental results on MICC Florence and AFLW2000-3D verify the efficacy of the proposed method.\n\nThe presentation and writing are clear. The problem solved in this paper aligns with real applications.\n\nMy concerns regarding this paper are as below.\n1) What are the training computational complexity and testing time cost of the proposed method? Since speed is very important for real applications.\n2) The datasets used for evaluation are quite old. More experiments on more recent challenging benchmarks are needed to verify the superiority of the proposed method, e.g., IJB-B/C, etc.\n3) Some related works are missing and need to be discussed, e.g., Joint 3D Face Reconstruction and Dense Face Alignment from A Single Image with 2D-Assisted Self-Supervised Learning [Tu et al., 2019], 3D-Aided Dual-Agent GANs for Unconstrained Face Recognition [Zhao et al., T-PAMI 2018], 3D-Aided Deep Pose-Invariant Face Recognition [Zhao et al., IJCAI 2018], etc.\n4) Format of references should be consistent.\n\nBased on my above comments, I give the rate of WR. If the authors could solve my concerns in rebuttal, I would like to further adjust my rate."}
