Four sets of experiments are provided follow the setting in [1].\nPros:\n1. The research problem studied in the paper is important.\n2. Authors conduct extensive experiments on multiple dataset.\nCons:\n1. The paper lacks formal justifications on the raised claims. They look intuitive and post-justified by experiments and not by rigorous arguments.\n2. All the experiments are conducted based on the convolutional graph neural network based methods. It is suggested to evaluate on the other types of graph neural network, e.g.\u00a0Recurrent Graph Neural Networks, Graph Autoencoder.\n3. The writing needs to be significantly improved.\n\n[1] Shchur et al. \"Pitfalls of Graph Neural Network Evaluation\",\u00a0\u00a0arXiv preprint arXiv:1811.05868\u00a0(2018)"}
