Experiments on a few data sets and experiments prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach over competitive baselines. \n\nAlthough the proposed approach is interesting and works well on different datasets,  one strong concern I have is the high computational complexity of the algorithm, which is as high as o(n^3) (n is the number of nodes). This limits the applicability of the algorithm to large graphs.  Besides, I also have the following questions:\n(1) In the experiments, I assume one CRF pooling layer is used. What would be the results if multiple layers are used?\n\n(2) How did you select the number of clusters K? How would the performance change w.r.t. different K?\n"}
