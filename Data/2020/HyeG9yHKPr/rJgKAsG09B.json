The flow of the paper proceeds in learning a causally correct model in the sense that the model is robust to any intervention changes. Specifically, the paper considers a setting called \"partial model\" meaning a generative model conditioned on functions of past observations. To make the partial model causally correct, the paper considers the partial model conditioned on the backdoor that blocks all paths from the confounding variables. \n\n1. The problem that this paper addresses seems to be new and interesting. The approach makes much sense: the problem is due to the confounding effect which can be addressed by introducing some other variables that implicitly blocks the confouders.  \n\n2. The  paper assumes the existence of the backdoor variable which is crucial for causal correctness. Does the backdoor always exist? Pearl's book may have some discussions on this. It will be still useful to include some materials in case of unfamiliar readers. \n\n"}
