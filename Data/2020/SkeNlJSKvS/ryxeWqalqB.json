The authors conduct thorough experiments to backup their claims and hypotheses.\n\nCons:\n1. The writing needs to be improved. The four contributions listed do not have a clear logic flow.\n2. The proposed method seems like a combination of previous studies, making the paper more like a technical report.\n3. One advantage claimed by the authors is that only one latent variable has clear semantic meanings, which is not explicitly supported by the experiments."}
