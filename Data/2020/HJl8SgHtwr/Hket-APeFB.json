It is also proposed to use auxiliary losses (predicting other chemical properties).\n\nAlthough I am not an expert in chemistry, the new datasets seem fairly well thought out and their utility is well motivated. The proposed change to the MPNN network architecture is rather simple and hardly physics inspired, but the empirical improvement seems substantial, so this too is a nice contribution. So I have decided to give the \u201cweak accept\u201d rating.\n\nIn 4.2 it is explained how different ways of incorporating bond information were evaluated, and it is stated that \u201cbest results were obtained in the case a.ii). However, no results are presented to support this claim, leaving the reader to wonder how rigorous this exploration was. I would suggest systematically evaluating the different options and including the results in an appendix. \n\nIn table 1 results are shown for the MPNN baseline, baseline with specialised node updates a.ii, and with auxiliary estimates. However, combinations of these are not evaluated. Nevertheless, if I understood correctly, the VIMPNN method tested later includes all of the separate improvements. It would be good to include experimental results to motivate this.\n\nAs acknowledged in the paper, the idea of using bond-type information was already in Gilmer et al. Also, I think the different ways of including bond-type explored in this paper are not really informed by physics. The choice for method a.ii is made based on empirical results. This is not a problem in itself, but I would suggest that the authors change the wording to not over-promise on the physics-inspiredness. E.g. the abstract says \u201cVIMPNN integrates prior knowledge such as the existence of different interatomic bonds\u201d, suggesting that there is more prior knowledge being exploited than just bonds.\n\n\nComments:\n\n\u201cIt produces comparable accuracy to that of DFT while also improving computation time by 5 orders of magnitude\u201d. \nI assume this speedup is relative to DFT. It would be good to be explicit about that, and also discuss the speed relative to the MPNN baseline (I suppose MPNN and VIMPNN are similar).\n\n\u201cThe change of atomic distances are performed isomorphically\u201d - I would say \u201cisometrically\u201d. \n"}
