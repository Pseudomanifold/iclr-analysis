The general idea is based on the graph matching network (Li et.al, ICML 2019) that computes the node embeddings of two graphs with co-attentions. The training requires the supervision of ground truth matching. During inference an iterative method with heuristic stopping criteria is used. Experiments on tiny graphs show better results than learning based baselines, but worse results than MCS solver.\n\nOverall the paper is well motivated. However there are several major concerns with the paper:\n\n1. Since it relies on the solver to provide training data, it might be hard to train on large graphs as there would be no cheap supervision. Also it seems that getting slightly faster but much worse results than the solver on small graphs is not that exciting. \n\n2. It seems there's a mismatch between training and inference. The inference method is done iteratively, where the Eq (6) is somewhat not clear to me: as this ||w1-w2|| criteria is not trained during training, it seems quite heuristic by doing so. \n\n3. I\u2019m not sure why the two stop conditions are needed. One can easily check (incrementally) whether the added nodes are isomorphic.  \n\n4. The graphs used in experiments are too small. \n\nSome other minor issues:\n\nIt would be better to define Y with Eq (1) and Eq (2) in the paper. There seems to be no explicit definition of Y. \n\n", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "N/A"}
