The experiments empirically show the generation results, which show the power of the proposed GAN model.\n\nStrength:\n1. The problem is interesting. Sometimes it is real and reasonable to apply GAN on other domains with limited data. \n\n2. The motivation for multiple generators is interesting and useful. In real-world, transferring one single domain to another may cause unstable transfer results and transferring from multiple source domains can alleviate the problem.\n\n3. Empirically, the authors show the power of the proposed model.\n\nWeakness:\n\n1. For single GAN mining, the motivation of Miner M is a litter weird to me. I understand the goal for Miner M is to shift the distribution. I am curious about the power of M if the distribution in the target domain is quite similar to the source domain. It will be more interesting to investigate performance v.s. M design in the experiment parts and give more insights.\n\n2. The technical contribution is not enough. The key problem is how to use the pre-trained model. The model is too intuitive. It will be better to discuss the contributions in the rebuttal period.\n\n3. In the experiments, it will be more convincing if the authors can show more analysis on the probability p in multiple generators. {Car, Bus}->red vehicle with different combination ratios seems simple. I hope to see more complex case studies. "}
