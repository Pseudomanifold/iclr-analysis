The model utilized a network to identifies which part of the generative distribution of the pre-trained GAN close to the target domain. The experiments are conducted on several datasets with different architectures. \n\nFor me, the only novelty of the method comes from the miner network, which is limited. It could be difficult to generalize to the target domain with more/diverse classes. It could also fall when the source and target domain are quite different. \n\nI think the motivation of this work is similar to previous work on domain adaptation for generative models, which has been explored in several other papers. However, the paper did not mention them. \na. Unsupervised Image-to-Image Translation Networks, NIPS17.\nb. CyCADA: Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Domain Adaptation, ICML18. \nc. Person Transfer GAN to Bridge Domain Gap for Person Re-Identification, CVPR18.\n\nRegarding the experiments, I do not think the current setting is reasonable. All the splits are within the same domain (even the same dataset), digit-digit, face-face, object-object. There is not much domain gap there to evaluate the effectiveness of the knowledge transfer. The baseline is also pretty simple. "}
