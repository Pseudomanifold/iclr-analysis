The authors assess the validity of their method by comparing it to alternative rule-based, seq2seq, and style transfer methods, on metrics including content fidelity, style preservation, and linguistic fluency.\n\nAlthough the problems of style transfer and structured text generation are both interesting and important research questions in their own right, the authors' focus on a highly specific, and frankly contrived, problem wherein we wish to rewrite a sentence by imputing the information currently in it with replacement information, is instead much more amenable to non-learning rule-based methods, as their own findings show. Even with the most trivial rule-based baseline of identifying matching data type fields and replacing them with new structured data values, the rule-based method compares favorably (Table 2, Table 3). The most obvious flaws with the rule-based methods are that it sometimes leaves in no-longer-relevant information, or fails to add in all of the new structured field information. Both of these flaws can be largely remedied with the introduction of additional operations which cleave off parts of the original sentence which contain information not present in the structured text, and append additional structured field information via appending e.g. \"and [player_name]\". The paper itself also contains copious typos, grammatical errors, and awkwardly phrased text to the extent that it impedes understanding. This reviewer is therefore of the opinion that this paper should be rejected.\n\nTypos and awkward phrasings:\n* pg1 : \"under investigated\" --> \"under-investigated\"\n* pg1 : \"controll In\" --> \"control.
