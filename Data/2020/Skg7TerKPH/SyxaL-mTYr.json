They provide new datasets, and propose an objective which balances content fidelity and style preservation. The proposed model is evaluated against simple structured content to sentence generation system as well as recent style transfer methods. I believe the task is important, but I am not sure if the datasets used are right for this task. For both the datasets, the structured content is usually some facts which cannot be described in a lot of different styles. I suggest using data where users can use more emotions, resulting in a wider range of styles for the same content. Examples can be data from dialogue agents and reviews. Given the current data, I am not convinced about the style transfer claims. "}
