The paper achieves impressive results across a large selection of tasks, both in terms of sample efficiency and final performance.\n\nI found the paper interesting to read and well written. The main contribution (backpropagating analytic gradients through imagined trajectories?) could potentially be highlighted more but otherwise the paper was clear. I wonder if the authors ever looked at how much the size of the latent vector determines the performance of the system? Is there an optional latent vector size across domains or is that optimal size task dependent?  \n\nAdditionally, how much variance is there in the imagined trajectories from a certain starting state? In other words, are the endpoints of most imagined trajectories similar or very different? \n\nThere is actually not too much for me to critique and I would suggest this paper should be accepted. \n\nMinor comment:\n- On page 2 it says \u201cWe approach this limitation in latenby\u201d, which I assume is a typo? \n"}
