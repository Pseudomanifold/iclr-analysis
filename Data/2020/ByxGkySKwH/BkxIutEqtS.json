In particular a comparison to EDL would be interesting, since a similar entropy-encouraging term in the loss function is used during training, resulting is maximum entropy for OOD samples. \nSecond, I would have liked to see precision and recall of the OOD detection task in addition to AUC, allowing a more meaningful/complete comparison between the approaches.
