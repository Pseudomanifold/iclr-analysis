The authors use auto-encoders to separate the common and specific representations and to generate masks, which seems to be related to [1]. The authors empirically show the proposed method can be used for image translation, attribute editing.\n\nA small citation error:\n\"Jun-Yan Zhu, Taesung Park, Phillip Isola, and Alexei A Efros.
