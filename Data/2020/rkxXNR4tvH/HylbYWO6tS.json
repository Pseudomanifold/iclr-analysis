However, there are several significant drawbacks:\n\n1) The pruning approach is too simplistic. Network pruning has been a field of very active research as the authors have acknowledged, however, the approach used in the paper is a very simplistic remove the ones with lowest response one, for which, there is no experiment to justify its validity w.r.t. state-of-the-art pruning approaches. In fact, from Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 one can almost conclude that this naive pruning method is significantly inferior to state-of-the-art.\n2) Lack of novel insights. For an explanation paper, we would expect to obtain some new insights about the classification. The results that this paper get to, such as few filters were pruned in the lower layers, similar classes share similar filters, are not necessarily new knowledge to the community. In terms of the result analysis, mostly simple correlation analysis was used which presented no novelty nor insights."}
