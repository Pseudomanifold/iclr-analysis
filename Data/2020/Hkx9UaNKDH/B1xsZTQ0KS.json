The hope is that a more diverse set of tasks will be created, thus better approximating some unseen task in few-shot learning. They test this idea by rotating images to augment the data and then compare the two approaches. Their experiments were conducted using several data sets and a few different base learners. In nearly all the results, they show that their approach performs better. \n\nI find Figure 3 difficult to read because of the separation of the 1-shot and 5-shot classes. (The figure feels a bit clumsy to read.) I'm also unclear what that section contributes to the paper since it is so short. \n\nWhy only use rotations to augment?\n\nI weakly accept this paper because the simple idea seems elegant and appears to improve performance. Since I know little about the field, I will defer to other, more qualified reviewers. I would like to see more experimentation though since this is purely an experimental paper (theory would be wonderful). "}
