They show that, complex behaviour emerge as the episode progresses and agents are able to learn 6 emergent skills/(counter-)strategies (including tool use), where agents intentionally change their environment to suit their needs. Agents trained using self-play \n\nIn my opinion, this is an excellent paper which main contribution is to provide experimental evidence that relevant and complex skills and strategies can emerge from multi-agent RL competing scenarios.\n\nMinor comments:\n\n- Hide&seek rules and safety issues: is it not supposed that hiders and the seekers could not get together (i.e., hiders cannot push seekers or as we can see in some videos)? Furthermore, it is surprising (one would say worrying) that hiders identified the barriers as an impediment to the seeker (not only as a way to hide). I wouldn\u2019t say that this is a \u201c human-relevant strategies and skills \u201c as the authors claim. Hider agents even double walled seekers!  \n\n- Have the authors thought about joining the Animal-AI Olympics (http://animalaiolympics.com/) competition? It would be a great opportunity to to test the skills of your agents in a further general testing scenario. They provide an arena (test-bed) which contains 300 different intelligent tests for testing the cognitive abilities of RL agents (https://www.mdcrosby.com/blog/animalaiprizes1.html) which have to interact with the environment. \n"}
