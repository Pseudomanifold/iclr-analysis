The motivation was clearly presented. The proposed method seems to be comparable to alternatives, according to the empirical results. The presentation of the proposed methodology seems to be at some rather high level and, as a consequence, I got the idea but the technical side is not totally clear to me. Personally, I am wondering if the empirical results are convincing enough. This paper is unfortunately beyond my expertise and the final decision has to be rely on other reviews.\n\nMinor point:\n- Page 4: \"another\" should be \"the other\"?\n"}
