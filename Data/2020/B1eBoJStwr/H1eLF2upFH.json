Through a few simple example, the authors suggested that the cluster assumption doesn\u2019t hold for semantic segmentation. The paper also illustrated how to perturb the training examples so that consistency regularization still works for semantic segmentation. \nThe paper also introduce a perturbation method that can achieve high dimensional perturbation, which achieve solid experimental results.\n\nThe analysis part seems interesting and innovative to me. But it is very qualitative and I'm not fully convinced that the analysis on 2d example can actually carry over to high dimensional spaces for images. I also don't quite see the connection between the toy example and the proposed perturbation method. For example, why the proposed perturbation method has the property of \"the probability of a perturbation crossing the true class boundary must be very small compared to the amount of exploration in other dimensions\"?\n\nThe proposed algorithm is an extension of the existing cutout and cut mix. The way to generate new mask is a very smart design to me. This should be the most important contribution of the paper.\n\nThe writing of the paper is very clear and easy to follow. The experimental results look very convincing overall and proposed algorithm does show very promising results. \n\nTo sum up, the paper is an ok paper from the practical perspective, but the analysis in the paper wasn't strong enough to me."}
