Adding a consent to the max will not guarantee privacy unless you account for the privacy cost for testing whether the distance of f(D) is larger than 2. This is because the distance of f(D) is data-dependent and revealing it violates privacy. Since the whole privacy analysis of PATE is based on the privacy guarantee of the Noisy ArgMax, the epsilon calculated here is voided."}
