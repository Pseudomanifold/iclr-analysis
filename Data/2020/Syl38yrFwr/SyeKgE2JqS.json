The main idea of the proposed approach is to add a constant C to the maximum count collected from the ensemble, and then noise is furthermore added to the new counts. I can understand that by adding the large constant C, the identity of the maximum count could be preserved with high probability, leading to a better utility on the student side. However, equivalently, this could also be understood as that the noise is not added uniformly across all the counts, but instead a relatively smaller noise is added to the maximum count. Hence it is not clear to me whether the final composition will still be differentially private?\n"}
