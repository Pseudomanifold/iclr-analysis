The encoder-decoder is trained with a discriminator which can identify whether the input is malicious or normal. A malicious input image is purified with the help of a search procedure in the latent space of the auto-encoder. The gradient based search obtains a latent code that corresponds to the reconstructed image that is closest to the input. The algorithm uses output of the decoder as a starting point in the search. Experiments show a reasonable performance against adversarial attacks on MNIST and F-MNIST images. The proposal seems to be an alternative to the Defence-GAN method of (Samangouei et. al. 2018) where search is computationally expensive - due to multiple starting points and many iterations. The ease of optimization in the proposed method comes at the cost of accuracy (Table 1). However, for a single starting point during search and fewer iterations, it outperforms Defense-GAN by a significant margin (Table 2). "}
