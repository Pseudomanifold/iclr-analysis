To motivate this new model, the authors also provided a toy example to show how the abnormality in a time series is removed in the reconstructed signal using this additional regularization term. Experimental results were provided to support the proposed new model.\n\nI have a few concerns about some technical details of the paper, as explained below:\n1) The paper motivated the new model with difficulty in detecting change points in seasonal time series. However, the proposed model with the temporal regularization is not directly related to the seasonality or periodicity of the input data. It is more related to the smoothness of the latent code. Hence it seems to me that there is a slight disconnection between the motivation and the actually proposed model. It would be nice if the authors can provide more intuitive explanation on why the temporal regularization can handle well change point detection in seasonal temporal series.\n\n2) The temporal regularization proposed in this paper is very similar to the total variation penalty used extensively in statistics and image processing. It would be nice if the authors can make a connection between the two. For example:\nHarchaoui, Z., & L\u00e9vy-Leduc, C. (2010). Multiple change-point estimation with a total variation penalty. Journal of the American Statistical Association, 105(492), 1480-1493.\nBeck, A., & Teboulle, M. (2009). Fast gradient-based algorithms for constrained total variation image denoising and deblurring problems. IEEE transactions on image processing, 18(11), 2419-2434.\n\n3) In the experimental section 4.3, the authors mentioned that \"In Table 2, ... we can see that our algorithm outperforms the baseline model\". However, in Table 2 the precision of the proposed model (67%) is lower than the baseline model (68%). Hence it is not obvious to the reader that the proposed model outperforms the baseline. \n\n4) In the appendix B, the authors explained the architecture of the autoencoder used in the paper. I wonder why the authors chose an asymmetric structure between the encoder and decoder, as most autoencoders have a symmetric structure."}
