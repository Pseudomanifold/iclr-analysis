The proposed method directly searches for the mixed-precision architectures, unlike previous methods that separately optimize the neural network architectures, pruning policy, and quantization policy. The experimental results show that the proposed method can find better models than the state-of-the-art models.\n\n- It is not clear how the evolutionary algorithm applies to the framework of the proposed method, i.e., which parts are optimized by the evolutionary algorithm? Also, the details about the evolutionary algorithm part are not provided, for example, what is a genotype and a fitness function used in this paper? \n\n- It would be better to provide a comparison with a random search to make the contribution of the evolutionary algorithm clear.\n\n- It is not clear about the procedure of the proposed method during training and testing. Please elaborate on it by providing an algorithm table of the proposed method.\n\n- Please add an explanation about N in Table 2."}
