The authors specifically describe some desiredata for latent representations for LLC algorithms. The authors rigorously construct a learning framework that can satisfy the desiredata and then show how this can be tractably instantiated. \n\nThe paper overall is clear, however there is many equations in 4.2  with heavy subscritping making it sometimes difficult to read. The authours could attempt to better highlight the more critical parts of their propositins (e.g. eq. 8/9). \n\nThe methodology and insights appear novel and well motivated, however I am not familiar with many of the prior work.  The experiments compared to competing methods  show substantial improvement. The authors also motivate well why these improvements over the existing methods should occur and provide ablations to validate all the components of the final loss. Overall the paper appears very solid and may motivate insights and research  in more complex model based control and planning \n"}
