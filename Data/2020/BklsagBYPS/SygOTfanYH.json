F allows to detect mode collapse: as long as it is strictly positive, mode collapse is observed as parts of the training data have not been memorized. It aims at providing an alternative to the Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance and the Inception Score that rely on pretrained neural networks (whereas this new measure does not). It also provides insight into the DCGAN and WGAN networks in that regard, observing for instance that data subsampling helps decrease F, which motivates the use of a mixture of GANs.\n\nThis paper brings an interesting contribution to the evaluation of generative networks. However:\n\n1.\tThe use of the square distance in the image space is not obvious and not justified.\n2.\tComputation of this metric is not straightforward: there is no theoretical guarantee and it is computationally expensive.\n3.\tThe theoretical properties of this measure and its robustness are not investigated.\n4.\tTypos are obscuring the reading of the paper."}
