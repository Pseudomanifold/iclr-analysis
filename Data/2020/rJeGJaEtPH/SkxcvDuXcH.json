The main contribution is the introduction of a differentiable top-K region proposal that allows to train the whole model with only a supervision of the total number of instances (and their class) in the image. They test the performance of their method in simple visual tasks like cluttered MNIST, street digit recognition and finding the basis of procedural texture generation.\n\nThe paper is well written and motivated. The proposed method is clear and well formalized. Their reported results seem substantially better than the baselines they compare against. The additional experiments in their Appendix Fig. 7, analyzing the evolution of the heatmap loss, is interesting, although I think the heatmap visualization could be improved to better understand what the model is learning across iterations (improve legend to include at what iteration the heatmap is taken, give on what image this is evaluated).\n\nUnfortunately, their tasks seem quite easy, and it is hard to assess the impact of their method when working with more real-world data-sets, where the number of instances of every class is more loosely defined (we could always describe more objects in a real image from the COCO dataset for example). It seems of great importance to evaluate the limitations of their method in this direction, as the source of supervision might be too weak in the cases where the generated dataset might not have all the combinations of number of instances per image (as the cluttered MNIST has given that it\u2019s procedurally generated). The results on SVHN are a little bit confusing, and it\u2019s unclear what the \u201cSupervised\u201d method is, specially knowing that there are available methods that do obtain much better performance on this task using all the supervision available. It should also be better explained why the performance drops so drastically when the IoU threshold is increased. Finally, the texture generation experiments are very hard to interpret and are even further from real-world tasks.\n\nGiven my concerns on how this unsupervised approach can scale to real-life datasets, I suggest a weak reject, but I think the  proposed method has some interest for the community and I strongly encourage the authors to provide further evidence of performance of their method on more complex vision tasks."}
