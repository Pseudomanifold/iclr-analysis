The whole framework is built on top of cGAN-based projector discriminator framework where the input condition vector is also used in the discriminator stage.  The authors compared with one recent work and demonstrated improvements on face retrieval experiment. \n\n\nQuestions:\n1\tIn terms of differences with previous approaches,  not sure if the self-supervised learning is one of them, since it is also applied in previous Speech2Face framework.\n2\tBased on the listed generated examples in Fig.2, most faces are frontal, especially along Z axis, not sure if the variation of Z can determine the head orientation. Faces in the third row and the forth may not keep the identity that well, especially the comparison between the face at the first column with others.   \n3\tOne typo may need to be addressed in the first paragraph of page 5, there are \u201cthe the\u201d before word \u2018inference\u2019.\n4\tAs listed in Table 2, it seems the proposed approach achieves better performance when using 10 way training compared to other frameworks, any more analysis  why the proposed framework can achieve better performance in 10 way but obtain less accuracy in 2 way settings?   \n\n5\tDoes the test data of 2 way or 10 way experiments also include the same ratio of positive and negative pairs? If so, how about the performance on the same validation data?\n\n6\tAbout the results listed in Table 2, does the number 35^2 indicate 0.35? \n\n7.    It may be necessary to include these conditional face video generation works in the related work.\n\n"}
