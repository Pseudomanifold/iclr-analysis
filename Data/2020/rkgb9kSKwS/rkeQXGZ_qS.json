The experiments seem convincing enough that the authors made enough effort to prove their method might work.\n\n- Feature maps to show robustness of method is a good point\n- CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 are certainly a good start, but might not be the best datasets to test for image classification, in lieu of ImageNet and others.\n- Classification itself is a good start, it might be interesting to think about using this in a generative model such as GAN. The content reminds me of Self-Attention GAN which uses a similar non-local block (self-attention)."}
