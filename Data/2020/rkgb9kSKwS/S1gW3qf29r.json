The proposed spectral non-local block can be plugged into a neural network to improve its effectiveness. The paper also provides theoretical analyses of the stability of the proposed method, and also extend the method by including more  Chebyshev polynomial terms. Experiments are conducted on image classification and action recognition tasks, and they valid the effectiveness of the proposed method. \n\nThe idea is well-motivated, and it is a generalization of existing works in the literature. I do like this idea. However, I am afraid that the idea is not well explained and supported, thus I gave a weak reject to encourage the authors to further improve the paper.\n\nThe major concern I have is the reasonability of the experiments.  The experiments in the paper show relative performance gain with respect to a baseline method. It seems that there is a lack of comparison with state-of-the-art methods in the literature. For example, in Table 8, a performance gain is observed when compared with I3D. However, the recent STOA models can achieve much higher accuracy than the baseline. and also the proposed method. Since the proposed method is generic to all neural nets, it makes more sense to compare with SOTA and make improvements based on SOTA.  What is the conclusion from Table 4? Are you trying to demonstrate that the best configuration is DP3, and increasing the number of consecutive non-local blocks (from SP3 to SP5) doesn't work? It is awkward since the paper gives a stable hypothesis for deeper nonlocal structure, but experimentally the deeper structure doesn't work well. Figure 4 is abrupt without much background descriptions. Are the images randomly chosen? Ours here means SNL or gSNL? Is the colored superimposition the attention map (I believe so but the paper doesn't indicate so) and how to interpret it? What is the relation of the coverage of the critical parts on birds and the long-range dependency? More background descriptions and interpretations of the results are needed. \n\nAnother concern I have is the clarity of the writing. There are quite a number of informal use of English, mismatched descriptions, undefined acronyms, etc. For example, in the caption of Fig. 1, it is said self-attention and self-preserving are taken effect by W1 and W2, which is contradictory to what is illustrated in the figure. Also, the terms self-attention and self-preserving, and other terms such as CGNL, A2, Hadama (Hadamard?) product, are not formally defined or described.  A lot of grammar errors and informal use of English are present, such as \"which lead to\", \"the weight means\", \"when using in the neural network\", \"fig. 4\", \"Figure. 2\", \"more liberty for the parameter learning.\", etc. "}
