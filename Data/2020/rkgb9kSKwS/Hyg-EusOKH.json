First, they re-interpret the nonlocal blocks in a graph view and then use Chebyshev approximation to obtain the spectral nonlocal block which is quite simple by adding a ZW_1 term. Furthermore, they analyze the steady-state to build up a deeper nonlocal structure. Also, the gSNL is simple by adding a (2A-I)ZW_3 term.\n\nOverall, the paper is written well. I like the idea to interpret the nonlocal operation in the graph view. More important, the resulting formulation is quit concise for implementation. However, my main concern is the experiment, which should be further enhanced by perform large-scale video classification like Kinetics400."}
