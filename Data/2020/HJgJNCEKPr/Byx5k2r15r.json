Nevertheless, I have concerns about this paper.    While the basic idea of progressive search is reasonable,  it is not tightly coupled to the Bayesian argument the authors use to motivate it.  This argument makes some unnatural assumptions (e.g. layers are independent); and the authors do not give any rigorous analysis, either theoretical or empirical,  of how their progressive search method mollifies the posterior fading problem they discuss.  IMO, the whole Bayesian setup makes the motivation unnecessarily complex, and is math for maths sake, rather than for clarification.  The authors do try to show that the final results are better (which isn't the same thing as saying that the method is fixing posterior fading); but I don't think these experiments are convincing.  In particular, the authors seem to use different regularizers than there competitors, and it is not clear where from where the performance gains come."}
