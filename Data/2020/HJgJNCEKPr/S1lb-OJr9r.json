But, as a few other folks pointed out it is important to do thorough comparisons and it looks like when authors compare the current method to other methods there are other changes to the pipeline that could give boost to the accuracy. So, the claim of achieving state of the art is disputable.\n\nIt will be good to decouple the bells and whistles and compare methods on an even footing. If authors can comment on that I still think it is a valuable idea and even if there is no significant delta the work can be a useful contribution."}
