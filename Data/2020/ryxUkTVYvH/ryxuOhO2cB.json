The authors propose a progressive GAN with frequency-oriented attention modules for high resolution and fast controllable and interpretable face completion, which learns face structures from coarse to fine guided by the FOAM. Experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. This paper is well written and is easy to understand. \n\n1. The most interesting idea is the frequency-oriented attention modules ,while the idea of structure-aware seems very common in the area.\n\n2. The experiments are unconvincing. There are so many works about face synthesis in recent years. Why do the authors only compare with GL and CTX? Also, the authors do not study how each component affects the final performance, which is very important for the reader to understand why it works.\n\n3. In general, the framework of the proposed method is very common. This paper only follow previous work and lacks new insights about the problem. "}
