Using facial landmarks and facial attributes, face completion became controllable as both are used as conditional information (input) for the generation (synthesis). Moreover, the proposed Frequency-Oriented Attention Module (FOAM) enables an interpretable coarse-to-fine progressive generative process. The proposed methods show significant improvement in the completion quality.\n\nOverall,  the method shows how the face completion can be controlled and how the face completion is done by improving details. The attentive framework makes possible to do kinds of band-pass filtering. The results are impressive but have some concerns as the following:\n\n- Have you tried to train models without using facial landmarks? Are facial landmarks only for controlling facial expressions?\n- As I carefully looked at the generated faces, many of them have asymmetric (unbalanced) eyes. Is it due to the predicted facial landmarks?\n- Is there any randomness (random input) involved during completion (generation)? Is this model possible to generate different faces from the same conditional input?\n- What happens if the attributes are interpolated rather than zero or one?\n- The order of Fig 4 and 5 seems weird."}
