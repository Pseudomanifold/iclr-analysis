To handle possibly long inputs and outputs, as well as significant length differences, they propose to use sliding windows. For high-dimensional outputs, they use an iterative approach predicting each dimension independently. They evaluate their models on earthquake data on on activity translation (video to motion capture).\n\nI would reject this paper because it largely ignores the litterature on speech recognition, text-to-speech synthesis and speech-to-speech translation (e.g. Jia et al. Direct speech-to-speech translation with a sequence-to-sequence model). I would suggest to the authors to familiarize themselves with work presented at conferences such as Interspeech and ICASSP.\n\nThe contributions of the paper are unfortunately minimal. Window-based representations are already used, for example to obtain spectrograms. Predicting each feature independently appears very inefficient and mostly suitable for small datasets.\n\nWhile it wouldn't change my rating of the paper, there are many typos (e.g. acceleormeter, informaion) that could easily be corrected."}
