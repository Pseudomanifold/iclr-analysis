This result is not apriori obvious and is of interest.\n\nAuthors are commended for balancing brevity, intelligibility, and precision.  However, it is not clear which elements of the proof technique are inapplicable to leaky ReLUs.  It would be helpful to include a brief discussion on this.\n\nI recommend acceptance, since I didn't find any proof errors and the contribution is clear.\n"}
