They argue that it should not be possible to calibrate the output of a mis-specified model. It is of course a bad idea to model a Gaussian with a Cauchy distribution (the way it is always a bad idea to have a mis-specified model), but I would actually argue that the isotonic regression based approach by Kuleshov et al., 2018 is more robust against model mis-specification due to its higher flexibility and thus a more powerful approach for pos-hoc calibration. \n\nSecond, I find the approach lacks novelty and is a straightforward application of the well established temperature scaling method and the expected calibration error to regression tasks. In addition, there are only minor differences to Phan et al 2018, CoRR.\n\nMost importantly, I have major concerns regarding the lack of in-depth evaluation. The authors provide no systematic comparison to the state-of-the art (Kuleshov et al., 2018) and only show reliability diagrams (they introduced themselves) for one singe (real) dataset and only their own method.
