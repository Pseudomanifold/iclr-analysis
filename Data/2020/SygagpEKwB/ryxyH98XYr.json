This paper needs a substantial rewrite to make clear what specific contributions are from the multitude of experiments run in this study. As is, the two contributions stated in the introduction are both obvious and not particularly significant -- that having some labels of the type of disentanglement desired helps when used as a validation set and as a small number of labels for learning a disentangled representation space. There are no obviously stated conclusions about which types of labels are better than others (4.2). Section 3.2 seems to have some interesting findings that small scale supervision can help significantly and fine-grained labeling is not necessarily needed, but I don't understand why that finding is presented there when Fig. 4 seems to perform a similar experiment on types of labels with no conclusion based on its results. Conclusion sentence of 4.3 is hard to decipher, but I assume is just saying S^2/S beats U/S even when S^2/S is subject to noisy labels. Overall, I find it very difficult to absorb the huge amount of results and find the analysis not well presented."}
