A seq-to-seq network is trained using stochastic gradient variational Bayes.        \nThe idea is interesting and new.\n\nThe method section could be made clearer by giving first some intuition, explaining the formulas in the prose and introducing the terms used.\n\nRegarding the crowd sourced MOS: how were the ratings obtained? how many subjects were used for the rating? How were they selected? Was each rater presented with samples from each method? Or was each method assessed by different groups of raters?\n\nThe experimental setting is a little weak, relying mostly on the Mean Opinion Score. It would be useful to include more evalution, for instance:\n* run a speech recognition method on the generated speech and measure the error rate\n\n* examples could be included in the supplementary  (e.g. spectrograms)\n\n* For the evaluation of emotional speech to be meaningful, the proposed classifier should be tested, and more detailed given (hyper-parameters, training setting, validation/test splits?, etc). In particular, it would be useful to compare the proposed method for affect classification to an existing (state-of-the-art) methodology. A state-of-the-art method should be ideally be directly used to classify the generated sequences into emotional classes.\n\nThe authors collected data in studio conditions, as such it is hard to compare. Will the data be released? How much hdata was collected?\nIt seems that what the authors effectively do is condition on discrete emotion classes, not valence and arousal, which are continuous measures of affect."}
