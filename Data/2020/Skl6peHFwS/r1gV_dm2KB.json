Mainly the data was corrected from twitter. The data was prepossessed to deal with by popular classification methods. The LDA and PDA are used to construct the identifier with high accuracy. Finally, Practical data was used to assess the performance of several machine learning algorithms.\n\nThe research topic is important from the sociological viewpoint. I'm not sure whether this paper suits to the publication from ICRL. Besides that, the authors did not show any technical insight into the numerical results. That is, can the authors explain the reason why the linear logistic regression with TF-IDF features outperformed all the other methods? Overall, this paper did not provide any useful knowledge, while this paper introduced some statistical methods and showed numerical results. I recommend the authors to add more beneficial insight and to submit the paper to other conferences that deals with sociological issues."}
