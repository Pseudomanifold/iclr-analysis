The paper compared using continuous cache (aka soft attention over all items in the cache), with using nearest neighbor approach (hard attention), and concluded that using a large continuous cache is not superior to using a simple 50-nn hard attention (which is as expected since I can imagine the soft weights are extremely sparse over all items in the cache). \n\nThat seems to say NN is a simple feature extractor, and the contribution of the episodic memory becomes suspicious. What if we simply clustering each ImageNet feature to K clusters and use centroids as cache feature, instead of taking bother to learn such cache contents?  And for reducing the dimension, it seems to necessary to compare with NN search with product quantization (Herve Jegou 2011, \"Product quantization for nearest neighbor search\") for fair comparison.\n\nThe generalization capacity is some other concern. Say if the dataset receives new images,  is it robust to such images, or simply unseen images would be classified as adversaries?\n\nThis paper mainly proves some existing conclusions such that nearest neighbor search is effective against adversarial attack. The design and theory seem to be existing already and the novelty is the main concern for acceptance. "}
