Though the paper references [Orhan, 2018], it is inappropriate to copy diagrams and text without marking them as directly sourced/quoted from [Orhan, 2018]; this is potentially plagiarism.\n\n-----\n\nThis paper analyzes the effectiveness of combining caching [Orhan, 2018] and shape-based models [Geirhos et al, 2019] as a defense against adversarial examples.  Experiments examine white-box, gray-box, and black-box attack scenarios, where the gray-box scenario corresponds to an adversary having knowledge of the network model but not the contents of the cache.\n\nNovelty appears limited.  While there is some value in the result that caching [Orhan, 2018] synergizes with Shape-ResNet [Geirhos et al, 2019] in improving adversarial robustness, I am not convinced this a sufficiently impactful contribution.  Moreover [Orhan, 2018], which introduced the caching model, also conducted experiments aimed at analyzing its adversarial robustness.  Novelty is thus limited to some additional experiments along these established lines and swapping ResNet for Shape-ResNet.  The paper does not develop any fundamentally new ideas.\n"}
