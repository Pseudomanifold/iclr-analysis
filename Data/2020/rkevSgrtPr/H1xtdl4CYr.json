They note that this holds even with very strong constraints on the non-bias weights. \n\nThey assert that their results are general to other kinds of neural networks and similar learners. They leave the paper with a question regarding limitations on bias weights. \n\nI do not feel qualified to review this paper. I have opted for a weak accept since it seems thorough and the conclusions offer promise for other applications. However, I will defer to other, more qualified reviewers who have more carefully reviewed the paper than I have. "}
