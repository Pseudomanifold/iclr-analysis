The new proof provides new insights into the universal approximation property. I consider these the main contribution of the paper. Specifically, the authors\n- provide an upper bound on the required width for the neural network\n- show that the approximation property still holds even if strong further requirements are imposed on the weights of the first or last layer. \n\nI rate this submission a weak accept. It\u2019s a very good paper. The work makes useful contributions that should and will be of interest to many in the field. The paper is generally well-written. \n\n\nSome remarks:\n\n- Being somewhat long, the \u201cProof of Theorem 3.1\u201d would be a much better read if the authors prefixed it  with an outline of the strategy that the proof takes. \n\n- The authors point out that the lack of dependence of Theorem 3.1 on epsilon is surprising, and cite Lin\u2019s work from 2017 who previously found such an independence. Lin\u2019s derivation of the epsilon-independent UAP is much more intuitive than that of this submission, in which the epsilon independence really pops out somewhat magically and for me only made sense when I read the paper again. I would encourage the authors to add to Lin\u2019s paper\u2019s citation sentence that this paper motivates the epsilon independence well. Alternatively, the authors could add a few sentences to their paper to provide intuition on how the epsilon-independence comes about in their line of argument. \n"}
