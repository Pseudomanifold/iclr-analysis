The baselines are not very representative. Except for APP, the remaining three methods are not motivated by directed graphs. To my knowledge, authors can further consider the following two methods as their baselines.\n\na) The classic method like the Okada-Imaizumi Radius Distance Model in \u201cOkada, Akinori, and Tadashi Imaizumi. \"Nonmetric multidimensional scaling of asymmetric proximities.\" Behaviormetrika 14.21 (1987): 81-96.\u201d This method represents each node in a directed graph as an embedding vector with a radius and proposed a Hausdorff-like distance.\n\nb) The recent work in [35]. This method also embeds nodes by elliptical distributions, but the distance is measured in the Wasserstein space. \n\nThis work will be stronger if the authors discuss the advantages of the proposed model compared with these two methods and add more comparison experiments.\n\n\n2. In practice, node embeddings are always used in down-stream learning tasks. Besides the classic statistical measurements, I would like to see a down-stream application of the proposed method, e.g., node classification/clustering. Adding such an experiment will make the advantage of the proposed method more convincing."}
