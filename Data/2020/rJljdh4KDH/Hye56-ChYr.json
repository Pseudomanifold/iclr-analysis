The primary motivation of Space2Vec is to integrate representations of different spatial scales which could potentially make the spatial representations more informative and meaningful as features. Space2Vec is trained as a part of an encoder-decoder framework, where Space2Vec encodes the spatial features of all the points that are fed as input to the framework. \n\nThey conducted experiments on real world geographic data where they predict types of point of interests (POIs) at given positions based on their 1) locations (location-modeling) and 2) spatial neighborhood (spatial context modeling). They evaluated Space2Vec against other ML approaches for encoding spatial information including RBF kernels, multi-layer feed forward nets, and tile embedding approaches. Their results indicate that that Space2Vec approach performs  better (albeit marginally) than other ML methods. \n\nI am giving this paper a weak reject rating mainly because of weak results and lack of motivation for location modeling problem (where their approach performs significantly better than baselines).   I explain my concerns below under detailed comments.\n\nDetailed Comments: \n1) Motivation of location modeling problem does not sound compelling enough to me, especially in the context of Point of Interest(POI) classification approach. I could not imagine any scenario where access to information from spatial neighborhood will be denied. If authors could present strong motivating examples for this problem and demonstrate the utility of their proposed approach in that setting, that will make the paper much stronger.  \n2) In spatial context modeling problem, the improvements in the results (Table 2) appear to be marginal(0.185 against 0.181, 25.7 against 25.3). Authors should try out more datasets to convincingly justify the superiority of their approach over other methods.\n\n"}
