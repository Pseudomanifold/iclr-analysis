The proposed methods are evaluated on two image restoration tasks, including compressive sensing and image super-resolution. The effectiveness of the combination is also presented.\n\nAuthors devote themselves to remove the representation error of the GAN image prior. Intuitively, the manner of the proposed linear combination model is rough and less reasonable. In Alg.1, the detailed algorithmic process is presented, it is clear that authors need to pre-train the used GAN and Deep Decoder, then combine them to train one network. If the motivation of this paper is to remove the representation error of GAN, GAN should be viewed as the main body. However, the authors view GAN and Deep Decoder as the same position against the original intention.\n\nAdditionally, in the experimental part, the ablation studies indeed reflect the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, but it looks like the Deep Decoder plays a key role in all cases. In other words, the GAN image prior just plays a supporting role. This is also far away from motivation.\n\nMore importantly, I cannot see the surprising results because of this work only compare themselves with some basic version or na\u00efve methods. All state-of-the-art approaches to different tasks are ignored, which is the other big disadvantage. \n\nIn Table 2, what is the meaning of \u2018CSGM\u2019\uff1f The authors should describe it.\n\nIn a word, from the algorithmic and experimental perspective, this paper cannot achieve satisfying performance.\n"}
