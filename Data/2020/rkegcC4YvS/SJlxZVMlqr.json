The combined model jointly infers the latent code for the trained GAN and the parameters in the untrained deep decoder. It also jointly infers the mixing coefficient alpha and beta during test time for each image, thus learning how much we should rely on GAN. The proposed hybrid model is helpful on compressed sensing experiments on the CelebA dataset; however, it is only marginally better than deep decoder on image super resolution and out-of-distribution compressed sensing.\n\nDetailed comments:\n-\tThe writing is clear and I was able to understand the model part of the paper. The algorithm box is helpful. However, I would still appreciate if the authors can provide an overall model figure in the model section to help understanding. \n-\tJointly learning the mixing coefficient is an interesting part of the model.\n-\tThe motivation in the abstract and intro could be strengthened. A smaller version of Figure 1 can be probably moved to the beginning of the paper to illustrate the problem of GAN. But even with the help of Figure 1, it is still unclear what is the fundamental problem for GAN. Simply combining a GAN with an untrained decoder model doesn\u2019t help elucidate the source of the problem. \n-\tThe proposed Hybrid model seems to help on compressed sensing experiments on CelebA. However, it doesn\u2019t help much on out-of-distribution experiments. Moreover, in the super-resolution task, as shown in Figure 5, the improvement over deep decoder is also not significant.\n-\tThe out-of-distribution experiments seems lack of thorough study. In particular, the paper only studies the transfer between CelebA -> Caltech-UCSD Bird dataset. It would be better if the paper can study a variety of other image datasets as well. Also some visualization on the Bird dataset should also be included.\n-\tEffect of n_pre needs to be further investigated. Why not directly train both models together? It would be good if the authors could comment on how sensitive the n_pre is and what is the intuition.\n-\tFor figures, I would recommend rename \u201cHybrid\u201d to \u201cHybrid (Ours)\u201d to highlight the paper\u2019s contribution, and use a brighter color.\n-\tFigure 5 should be renamed as a Table. \n-\tHyperparameter details should be moved to the Experiment section.\n\nConclusion:\nThe paper proposes a simple combination of a trained GAN and an untrained decoder model for the task of image restoration. Although the method is clear and straightforward, in the experiments, the influence of the new model component seems marginal. Moreover, the motivation is not strong enough. Therefore, I recommend weak reject."}
