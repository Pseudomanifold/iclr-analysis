The approach consists of three modules: an encoder, a cluster assigner and a (future outcome) predictor, all specified as neural networks.\n\nThe objective of the model is to produce cluster embeddings that are as informative of the outcomes as possible, while not being a direct function of covariates. Note that (2) may look misleading because it indicates that the outcome is a function of the cluster assignment, however, it does not show that the assignment is indeed a function of the covariates.\n\nIt is not entirely clear how a patient is assigned to a cluster provided that cluster assignments are a function of time.\n\nIt is desirable that performance metrics do not seem affected by the unknown number of clusters, however, this makes for difficult to interpret clusters. More so in practice when the number of identified clusters is a function of the model architecture and hyperparameters (\\alpha and \\beta). Is the number of clusters selected by cross-validation and if so, what performance metric is used to select the best choice?\n\nIn Table 3 for UKCF with 3 comorbidities, how are AUROC and AUPRC evaluated provided these are binary predictions?"}
