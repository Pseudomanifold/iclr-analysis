The key is to use pixel co-occurrence-based loss metric. The idea is very straightforward. But the description could be clearer. For example, what is the spatial size of P (\\bar P)? How does it influence the optimization?\n\nEquation (2): There are four loss functions on the right hand. How are the loss defined?\n\nHow is the GAN used?\n\nIn experiments, there is no evidence showing the benefit from the pixel Co-occurrence\n\nThere is a lack of much details. Given the current presentation, I cannot judge if the quality reaches the ICLR bar. "}
