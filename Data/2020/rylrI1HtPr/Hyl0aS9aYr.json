The GLCM is particularly well suited for automatic perceptual/textural in-domain comparisons, which does not require time-consuming expert MOS evaluations. Experimental validation is carried on X-ray images of rock samples and promising results are achieved.\n\nMy main concerns are as follows:\n- Novelty is quite limited. First, as the main contribution of this work, GLCM is proposed from Haralick et al.(1973), which is not novel. Second, the network structure used in this work is also based on SRGAN/EDSRGAN, which is also not novel.\n\n- Experiments are not convincing. In super-resolution task, the differences in Tab. 2 are quite minor, which can also be regarded as the same or may be caused by randomness. Moreover, the authors should conduct experiments on generic image SR to demonstrate the effectiveness of GLCM. Further, more qualitative visualizations are also needed to demonstrate the effectiveness of GLCM.\n\n- Page 5 only contains 1 figure, leaving a lot of  space that is not fully used. Besides, Fig. 3 cannot reflect the advantage of GLCM, since SRGAN is much larger and also better than SRCNN."}
