The overall idea is interesting and the biggest advantage is scalability of the framework to large graphs in terms of time and parameter complexity. \nThe major drawback of the paper is the lack of experimentation with real datasets. Based on the results from four datasets they used, the efficacy of their proposed method is unclear. The synthetic datasets are hard to admit in this case.\nNote: I could not verify the theory in detail yet. "}
