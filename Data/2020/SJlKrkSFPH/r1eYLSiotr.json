Based on cohen's and lee's result, it extends the \\lambda_TV distance to more general f-divergence. Besides, some other techniques, e.g. reference distribution, are also included in the framework. For L_0 and L_1 perturbation, the proposed framework comes to better results than all the related methods.\n\nStrengths:\n[+] Detailed analysis and theorem.\n[+] Describing the background and conclusions clearly.\n\nWeaknesses:\n[-] In the experiment section, for ImageNet, baselines use ResNet-50 but the authors use ResNet-152. I wonder whether this is fair enough.\n[-] Renyi divergence is not a proper f-divergence. Therefore, maybe the title should be changed.\n[-] The theorem part contains too many details and some important parts (e.g. tightness) are in appendix. It should be re-organized.\n\nQuestions:\n[.] In Appendix A.7, Lagrangian strong-duality has been used to show the tightness, but I wonder whether the tightness holds for any kind f-divergence? If the authors can write down some theorem about the tightness, it will be better."}
