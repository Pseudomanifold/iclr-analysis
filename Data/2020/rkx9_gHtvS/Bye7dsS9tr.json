The search is done entirely in the text space. The method consists of a RL-based controller (which chooses whether to ask a question or give a result) and an information-theoretic criterion (for which question to ask). The proposed method is compared to several no-interaction baselines, and two basic interaction methods (static interaction which does not use the initial query, and randomly chosen questions). The method outperforms the baselines, in both a simulated and live scenario. Unfortunately, information-theoretic search is not new (e.g. see Ferecatu and Geman, ICCV 2007, \"Interactive search for image categories by mental matching\"; Kovashka and Grauman, ICCV 2013, \"Attribute Pivots for Guiding Relevance Feedback in Image Search\", etc.) This means the method isn't particularly novel, and importantly, the proposed work needs to be compared to stronger baselines from recent literature."}
