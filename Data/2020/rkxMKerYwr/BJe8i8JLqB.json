With the tool, authors could see how individual layers could related each other across-layer (along the depth) and single layer (training epoch). \n\nI believe that the contributions of this paper are week in analyzing individual layers across-layer since there are many extensive studies are conducted on information bottleneck methods with mutual information. I believe that those methods are better to analyze the dynamics of learning even without the additional label distribution mapping.\n\nHowever, authors of this paper presents a way to utilize the label distribution mapping to compare the distance of individual layers when an input image come as shown in Figure 5 which I believe the main contribution of this paper. \n\nThe (somehow artificial and ambiguous) term, label distribution is used several places before it is defined. Even in Section 3, the label distribution mapping is not clearly explained except for the description of FC+softmax. Thus, it would be better to clarify the definition. Also, it is not clear that the label distribution reflect the actual distribution of (nodes or feature maps) in a specific layer. It would be good to spend more space and resources (e.g., image and/or running examples) to explain the definition of label distribution."}
