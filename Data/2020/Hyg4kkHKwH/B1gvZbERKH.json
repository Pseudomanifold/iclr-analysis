They evaluate their V1Net model on a new task they call the texturized challenge (spectrally perturbed CIFAR-10 images) and on contour segmentation on BSDS500 and show that their approach outperforms some baselines.\n\nStrengths:\n+ The biological motivation is quite clear\n+ Architecture is simpler than that of previous related work (hGRU)\n\nWeaknesses:\n- Not clear what the objectives/contributions are\n- No advancement of state of the art in computer vision\n- No novel insights about brain function\n- Motivation of the \"texturized challenge\" is unclear\n- Performance on BSDS500 is far from state of the art\n- Value of the qualitative analysis on stylized ImageNet is unclear\n\nOverall, I'm not sure what the goal of this paper is. It neither presents an advance of the state of the art in any computer vision problem nor does it lead to any novel insights about the brain. The lack of a clear statement about the contributions of the paper seems to confirm this impression \u2013 the authors don't seem to know either."}
