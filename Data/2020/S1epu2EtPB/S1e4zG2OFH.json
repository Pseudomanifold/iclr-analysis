The authors also measured the diversity and quality of the generated in-between video sequences.\n\n1. This proposed model follows the typical encoder\u2014stochastic sequence modeling\u2014decoder framework. The major novelty is on the stochastic sequence modeling module. But I find the architecture of this module not fully motivated. Did the authors engineer the architecture through a lot of trials?\n\n2. The authors might consider the unique characteristics of the video inbetweening task since as far as I see, the proposed model can also be used for the video prediction task given the first two frames.\n\n3. Because of the 3d Convs, the proposed model cannot be directly used for generating missing frames with variable length. How did the author cope with this problem?\n\n4. Since the proposed model has multiple 3d Convs, the authors might show the computational cost, e.g. training/inference speed, memory footprint, and the number of parameters, in experiments. \n\n5. The authors might include more existing work for experimental comparison."}
