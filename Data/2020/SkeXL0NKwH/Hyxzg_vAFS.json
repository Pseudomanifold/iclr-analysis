The authors compare their method to SGD for convolutional networks on MNIST and demonstrate improvements in terms of accuracy. The authors make use of the Optimal Kronecker-sum algorithm of Benzing et al and propose further improvements to it in the form of the SKS algorithm.\n\nThe main weakness of the paper seems to me limited experimental results - they mainly show improvements for CNNs on MNIST. The gains from their method would be made more  convincing by doing more large scale experiments on other larger datasets such as CIFAR-10/100, Imagenet and text datasets. \n\nOverall, I recommend acceptance based on the thoroughness of the work and the authors open-sourcing their code which would additionally help with reproducibility of their results."}
