The main contribution is an algorithm called Streaming Kronecker-Sum Approximation. The authors claim that the proposed method addresses four key challenges of low weight update density, weight quantization, low auxiliary memory, and online learning.\n\nThe paper should be rejected because the following reasons:\n(1) The paper is a little hard to follow and the writing can be significantly improved. In particular, the authors introduces four main challenges in section 3. However, I found they are not that accessible and hard to understand. In section 4.4.2, the objective is to get a minimum variance rank-r approximation to the diagonal matrix \\Sigma, but I think the authors mix \"m\" up with \"r\".\n(2) The novelty of the algorithm is limited. From section 4.1 to 4.5, most discussions are about previously proposed methods. The algorithm proposed by author (i.e., SKS) only involves some basic manipulations of linear algebra. I don't think it's novel enough to be a new algorithm.\n(3) Experimental results are limited. The authors spent a lot of time discussing on-device computing, but all their experiments are just simulations on standard benchmarks. For such a paper concerning training on edge devices, I would expect to see some experiments on real edge devices.\n\nOverall, I think the paper needs further improvements to be qualified for being accepted."}
