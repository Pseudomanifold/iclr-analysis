The diverse and consistent colorization results are compelling (with comparison with previous methods), while clearly showing the failure cases where the model should be improved. Ablation studies are done to show the importance of different components (e.g. the conditioning network). The paper is clearly written. \n\nA few remarks:\n- arctan soft-clamping seems very similar to the scalar times tanh soft-clamping of Real NVP (Dinh et al., 2016). Why was arctan adopted?\n- the choice of the car image (the biggest one in Figure 10) for the colorization transfer is questionable. I'm not able to tell from this figure if there was any segmentation happening in the model. The pose of the cars are similar, the car in the back is mostly black. The colorization transfer result gives me the impression that the segmentation is not done properly, e.g. the red color from the red car image seems to spill outside of the confine of the car in the colorization transfer."}
