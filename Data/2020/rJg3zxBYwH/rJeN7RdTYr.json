The idea is to use conditioning variables as additional inputs to the flow parameter forming networks.  The model was demonstrated on image superresolution and vessel segmentation.\n\nI find the contribution of this paper minimal. The idea of conditioning has extensively been used during recent years because it is the most natural thing to do (e.g., [1], [2] and numerous other papers). Their's nothing new about the flows used in this paper. The results in table 2 are not convincing; I see no benefit of using the proposed flow model for image super-resolution instead of the SOTA super-resolution methods. This also applies to other experiments.\n\n[1] van den Oord et al., Conditional Image Generation with PixelCNN Decoders, 2016.\n[2] Papamakarios et al., Masked Autoregressive Flow for Density Estimation, 2017."}
