This is then used to predict whether a Bitcoin address will become empty after a year. The results are better than flipping a coin, but worse than an existing baseline.\n\nGiven the apparent lack of any technical contribution to machine learning theory or practice, the inconclusive empirical results, and the generally unpolished writing (e.g., long run-on sentence in the conclusion, vague problem definition), I do not believe this paper is suitable for publication."}
