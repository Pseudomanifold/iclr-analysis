It uses autoencoder to extract the feature of the transaction and construct a transaction graph. Then the node2vec algorithm is used to generate node embeddings for the given graph. The task is to predict the behavior of addresses.  The experiments are conducted against Multi Level Sequence Learners (MLSLs), one of the best performing models on bitcoin address data.\n\nPros: \nThis work studies an interesting and challenging problem.\n\nCons\n1. This is an unfinished work. The proposed method lack of detail description.\n2. The performance is much lower than the MLSLs baseline methods. "}
