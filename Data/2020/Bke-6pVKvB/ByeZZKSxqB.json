An important subtopic of adversarial ML.\nThe authors propose using a GAN to generate poisoning data points, as an alternative to existing methods.\n\nWhile most (or all) of the paper is devoted to illustrate the effectiveness of the approach against *non-protected* ML. My only and biggest concern with this paper is that no defense mechanism has been tested against, and there are many in the literature. (see e.g. Diakonikolas et al ICML 2019).\n\nThus my question for the rebuttal period: How would pGAN perform when defense mechanisms are deployed during the learning phase? (ideally, a thorough experiment illustrating the strength of pGAN against a few defense mechanisms would help re-evaluating the score)"}
