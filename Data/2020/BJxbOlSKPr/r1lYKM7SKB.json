The empirical study demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.\nI\u2019m not familiar with the area. The differences between this work and [1] should be elaborated more in the related work, since they are closely related.\nBesides, for the technical part, DPQ-SX outperforms DPQ-VQ while the softmax approximation seems identical to that developed in [1].\n\n[1] ICML\u201918: Learning K-way D-dimensional Discrete Codes for Compact Embedding Representations"}
