CutOut itself consists of randomly masking out a rectangular region of an image. In CopyOut one chooses a source and target images, and a rectangular region from the source image is copied into target image.\n\n\nThough the extensions seem to provide an improvement in performance, we feel there are a few improvements that prevent the paper from being accepted:\n - more thorough experimental verification with various CNN architectures and larger variety of datasets datasets is needed (the original paper conducted experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN and STL-10).\n- better exposition needed - it would have been helpful to include more examples of the original methods CutOut and Sample pairing. Sample pairing though mentioned is not described. As CopyPairing is largely based on SamplePairing, it would have been helpful to include a diagram or thorough description of it."}
