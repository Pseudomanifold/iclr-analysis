The noise derives from the limited transferability of source-domain features, the unknown number of target-domain identities, and the imperfect results of the clustering algorithm. \n\nThe proposed framework, Mutual Mean-Teaching (MMT), performs pseudo label re\ufb01nery by optimizing the neural networks under the joint supervisions of off-line re\ufb01ned hard pseudo labels and on-line re\ufb01ned soft pseudo labels. Inspired by the teacher-student approaches (Reference: Tarvainen & Valpola, 2017; Reference: Zhang et al., 2018b), the proposed MMT framework provides robust soft pseudo labels in an on-line peer-teaching manner to simultaneously train two same networks. The networks gradually capture target-domain data distributions and thus re\ufb01ne pseudo labels for better feature learning.\n\nThe main contribution is proposing an unsupervised framework (MMT) capable of tackling the noise problem in state-of-art UDA methods for person re-identification, via producing reliable soft labels in order to achieve better performance. Since the conventional triplet loss cannot properly work with soft labels, a softmax-triplet loss is proposed to enable training with soft triplet labels for mitigating the pseudo label noise.\n\nThe proposed MMT is evaluated on Market1501, DukeMTMC-reID, and MSMT17 datasets with four adaptation tasks: Market-to-Duke, Duke-to-Market, Market-to-MSMT, and Duke-to-MSMT. It outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with significant improvements in terms of Mean average precision (mAP) and Cumulative matching characteristic (CMC). In addition to that, ablation studies conducted to evaluate each component in the proposed MMT framework."}
