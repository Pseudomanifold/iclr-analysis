The authors also propose a variant of triplet loss for soft labels. Experiments show they achieve considerable improvement over state-of-the-art methods.\n\nQuestions:\n1. What's the difference between net 1 and net 2 in Fig. (2)? It seems they are redundant.\n\n2. The results in Table (1) seems to indicate that, in MSMT, if M_t is set to be near the actual identity numbers (1041), the performance will be much better. This makes me suspect that the proposed method benefits from ground truth information of the target domain, which makes the comparison unfair.\n"}
