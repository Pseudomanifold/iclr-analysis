The \"transferability\" (or robustness) of gamma \u03b3 should be studied. In real applications, \u03b3 should be selected before transferring to new black-box models. The experiments in this paper are done by reporting the best results under the best \u03b3. This is a hindsight. How can you pick up \u03b3 without accessing the transferability results?\n2. More theoretical explanations. It is unclear to me that why it works so well, since the back propagation is no longer coherent with the forward function."}
