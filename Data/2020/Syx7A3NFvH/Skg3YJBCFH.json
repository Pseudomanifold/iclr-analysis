Summary\n\nThe authors use decentralized MARL for networked system control. Each agent might control a traffic light (exp 1) or a car in traffic (exp 2). Some features of their approach are a spatial Markov assumption (only neighborhood matters), a spatial discount factor, and NeurComm: a general message passing scheme between agent policies. The authors compare their method with CommNet (averages messages before broadcast), DIAL (small-scale direct communication), etc.\n\n2. Decision (accept or reject) with one or two key reasons for this choice.\n\nWeak accept.\n\n3. Supporting arguments\n\nThe experiments and analysis of the more general communication scheme are nice and the assumptions used make sense for the environments considered (spatial interactions and dynamics).\nThe 2 environments used are nice, but it would be nice to see non-traffic applications as well.\nThe methodological contributions make sense in the spatial domain, but it would be interesting to see how neighborhood-based assumptions can be used in non-spatial / non-Euclidean domains.\n\n4. Additional feedback with the aim to improve the paper. Make it clear that these points are here to help, and not necessarily part of your decision assessment.\n\nIt would be nice to explain why / what communication strategy enables FPrint to do better than NeurComm.\n\n5.
