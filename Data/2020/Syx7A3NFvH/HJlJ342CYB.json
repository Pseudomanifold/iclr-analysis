The main contributions are 1) a spatial discount factor that can stablize the learning process, 2) a differentiable communication protocol NeurComm. The paper was evaluated thoroughly by comparing against recent MARL baselines on two realistic environments.\n\nI voted for \"Weak Accept\" because this paper can have important real-world applications such as traffic control, autonomous driving and power grid. I really like its evaluations on the realistic environments. In addition, the paper is clearly written, the algorithm seems reasonable and the evaluations are comprehensive. \n\nI did not give it a higher rating because the proposed algorithm only outperforms the baselines in two out of four test cases. It is not a very strong result. In this situation, I would hope that see a more detailed discussion why in CACC experiments, NeurComm does not perform as well. And I would also suggest the paper adding more test cases to show that the proposed algorithm indeed can dominate in most of the cases."}
