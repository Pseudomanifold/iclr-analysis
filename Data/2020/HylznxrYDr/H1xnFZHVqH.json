The method is based on an existing method BERT (Devlin et al. 2018).  The authors have performed thorough experimental studies of the BERT method on an existing dataset TRC2-financial, a subset of TRC2 consisting of 1.8M news articles. Although the results may be of interest to communities working in this area, there are no or little novel contributions. By reading section 2 (only one page), which describes the method used, I have the impression that the authors took the method BERT and then applied this to the TRC2-financial dataset and then reported the results and also discussed some parameter choices in the BERT method. Therefore, the only value about this paper is the experimental results. Apart from this, there are no other contributions or insights to the methods/problems. In addition, section 2 is over-brief and very unclear, and it only contains a brief summary of the BERT method. For these reasons, I think the paper should be rejected for lacking novelty and writing quality. "}
