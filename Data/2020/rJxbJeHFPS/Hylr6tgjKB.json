The measure is based on the number of samples needed such that the expected generalization error is less than epsilon with 1-delta probability, where epsilon and delta are free parameters.\n\nThe paper proves the link between several classes of known algorithms and neural network architectures by showing how their sample complexity varies. For instance the paper shows that Graph Neural Network (GNN), can approximate any DP algorithm in a sample efficient manner, whereas MLP and deep sets (permutation invariant NN) can't. The paper empirically verifies their claims on 4 toy datasets, each representing an increasingly complex algorithm needed to solve the problem. \n\nI recommend this paper be accepted, since I think it's an important direction of research, and it formalizes a lot of intuition about neural network architectures.\n\nIt would be very interesting if the authors could actually compute the number of samples, M, for different NN architectures on the toy datasets, and show how it matches empirical findings. This could be a powerful tool if it could be made easy to use for the common practitioner."}
