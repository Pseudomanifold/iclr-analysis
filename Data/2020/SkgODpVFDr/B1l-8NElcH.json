The authors proposed ss convolution for regular convolution and group convolution. The authors tested the proposed ss convolution on multiple CNN models and show improvement of results. Finally, detailed analysis of spatial shuffling and ablation study was conducted.\nStrengths: The authors proposed spatially shuffled convolution to use the information outside of its RF. The operation only requires small amount of extra shuffling operations and without extra learnable parameters. The idea is straightforward and easy to understand. I especially like the visualization analysis of the receptive field and the layer ablation study suggested that all layers can benefit from the proposed operation, though more for middle and higher layers.\nWeakness: The proposed method seems to be a reasonable alternative for regular convolution, but  By fixing the permutation, not much insight is gained from this technique. \nSuggestions: It would be good to include the standard deviation for the results as the final results were average of 5 runs and can help to see if it\u2019s consistently useful. In the current setting, the permutation matrix is generated randomly, considering the proposed method is based on shuffling, how would different permutation affect the performance? In addition, I think it could be helpful if the authors can show more utilities of the proposed method, for example, are the proposed method capable of doing tasks similar to this paper **Learning long-range spatial dependencies with horizontal gated recurrent units**, which argues that the ability of CNNs to learn long-range spatial dependencies is limited by their localized receptive fields. One minor thing, in the main paper, the abbreviation for spatial shuffled convolution (ss convolution) is mentioned multiple times."}
