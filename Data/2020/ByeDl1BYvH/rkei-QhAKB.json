In particular, the global graph curvature depends on both dimension and loss function used for the network embedding. Besides, the authors studied the existing local curvatures and show that the existing graph curvatures may not be able to properly capture the global graph structure curvature. Extensive results demonstrate the statements proposed in the paper. In general, I like the paper due to its nice presentation, interesting view of graph curvature, and solid theoretical analysis. However, I am not familiar with graph curvature. All I can say is the approach is intuitively appealing, the text is well written and easy to follow, even for an outsider. I do not know any related works or what to expect from the results. I could not find anything wrong with this paper, but also do not have any intelligent questions to ask. "}
