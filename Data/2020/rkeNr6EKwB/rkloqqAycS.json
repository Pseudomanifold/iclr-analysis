The motivation is to limit the minibatch size with suitably sampled sets of datapoints. The proposed technique is relatively reasonable: e.g. extract features from an image, reduce dimensionality by the taking random projections, then run Core-Set selection. The Core-Set selection part of the method is modular from the rest of the GAN training, and can be applied easily. \n\nGenerally, I think this is reasonabl work. While the idea itself is not extremely novel, it is interesting to see CoreSets applied to GANs. The paper can be made stronger if there is more discussion about the theory of CoreSets and how good are the heuristics used in this paper. \n\n\n\n"}
