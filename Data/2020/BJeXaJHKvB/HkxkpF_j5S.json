Also, why P-BN helps path optimization is not clear in the paper. The experimental part is not convincing. All CNN with BN networks have much lower accuracy than people reported, e.g. https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/models.html for ResNet on ImageNet.\n\nClarity: The written is not clear enough. It is not easy to imagine how the re-parameterization works on CNNs since the kernel is applied over the entire image (\"hidden activations\").\n\nSignificance: \nSee above."}
