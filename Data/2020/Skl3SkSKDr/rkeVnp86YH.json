A Wasserstein GAN is then constructed by utilizing a permutation invariant critic network based on the architecture. Generating molecular structures in a one-shot fashion is conducted using the produced distance matrices in 3-d embedding.\n\nIn Section 2, the constraint on L makes M symmetric and positive semi-definite. This seems to be equivalent to treating M as a kernel matrix, and D is the pairwise distance between the kernel function induced by M. So, learning a valid Euclidian distance matrix is same as learning a kernel function.\n\nAuthors need to provide the evidence that Equation (5) holds for all function g, especially for the used softplus activation function. As I know, it holds if function g is a polynomial matrix function.\n\nIn Algorithm 1, what is the meaning of step 14? There is no definition or discussion about G and the \\nabla L. The construction function is the key contribution of this paper, which is incorporated the existing SchNet, so it is better to show the advantage of the proposed construction method comparing with SchNet.\n\nAlthough this paper is an application-oriented paper, the comparisons with baseline methods are preferred, such as some simple and straightforward baselines. Due to the lack of comparisons, it is hard to understand the statement given by authors that \u201c the current performance\u2026 is not optimal and can likely be improved by a better hyperparameter selection\u201d.\n\nIn Section 4, authors calculate the similarity of generated molecules by the closest respective matches, which is determined by the maximal atomic distance after assignment of atom identities and superposition. Is this the standard way to compute the similarity between two graph structures?\n"}
