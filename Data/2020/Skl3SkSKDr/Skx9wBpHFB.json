The idea is simple but nonetheless developed in a smart and effective fashion. The underlying theory is solid, even if some choices should have been discussed more deeply (e.g. the chosen loss function). Introduction and references are adequate, and the paper is readable by a quite broad audience, despite the detailed technical sections. The main issue related to the manuscript is very narrow target of the experimental part, limited to the isomers of a given compound - it would have been interesting to check its potentialities in generating more different structures and distance matrices, and thus to compare its effectiveness versus alternative generative approaches."}
