Section 3.3 for instance which discusses the non-alignment projection issue with AMSGrad is not rigorously written. There are no proofs to any theorems and even some of the theorems/corollaries are not written rigorously. \n\nOrganization-wise I feel it is difficult to see where the paper is going and some sort of outline / notation box would help. \n\nEmpirically, there are results on one dataset CIFAR10 that shows the author's proposed variant AdamAL works better. However, it is not the detailed types of experiments I was expecting of a paper that points out specific issues in AMSGrad. Shouldn't the experiments be showing these weaknesses in some sort of controlled setting? \n"}
