The proposed approach is a classic one already presented elsewhere, i.e., PMI to compute the similarity of terms using the co-occurrence statistics and thresholding to control the precision of lexicon. \n\nI have strong concerns to this work.\n\n- The proposed method already appeared in many literatures under different tasks, e.g., translation lexicon generation, or languages, e.g., Chinese, and the proposal is merely a yet another application of PMI.\n\n- The condition of the proposed method is not clear. I initially assumed an existence of a sentiment dictionary for Amharic, but section 3 introduced other resources, e.g., English/Amharic dictionary, which are not clearly stated in the introductory nor in the beginning of section 3. I'd strongly suggest the author to make it clear what kind of assumptions are made, e.g., existence of bilingual dictionary, or not. Otherwise, it is very hard to replicate the experiments.\n\n- Baselines sound not appropriate. Authors should conduct additional studies, e.g., graph propagation algorithm, to make sure that the proposed heuristic based approach is superior or not.\n\nI think this work should have been submitted to other conferences, workshops or journals, focusing more on low resource languages."}
