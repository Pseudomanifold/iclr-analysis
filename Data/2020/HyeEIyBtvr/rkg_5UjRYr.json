Especially, they focus on improving the search strategy for previously proposed computationally effective weight sharing methods for NAS. Current search strategies for the weight sharing NAS methods either focus on uniformly training all the network paths or selectively train different network paths with different frequency, where both have their own issues like wasting resources for unpromising candidates and unfair comparison among network paths. To this end, this paper proposes a balanced training strategy with \u201cselective drop mechanism\u201d. Further, they validate their approach by showing leading performance on ImageNet under mobile settings.\n\nOverall, I appreciate the effort on exploring new strategies for better search algorithm for NAS in the context of weight sharing methods. However, the analysis of the current approach is limited and some relevant papers are missing. More details below. \n\nArguments:\n1) This paper\u2019s main focus is on developing a better search strategy for NAS based weight sharing methods. The validation of their approach is supported via showing improvement in the accuracy on ImageNet task. However, my main argument is that you have to validate the proposed approach with better analysis on the search space along with improvement on the tasks. For example, \u201cEvaluating the Search Phase of Neural Architecture Search\u201d paper which studies the effectiveness of current search strategies is not referenced in this paper. I would suggest to do analysis of you search strategy by following the analysis experiments conducted in the above paper. \n\n2) The related work doesn\u2019t discuss the latest papers which suggest why and in what ways the current search strategies are based for weight-sharing based NAS approaches. As this paper is trying to address this problem, I would naturally assume that this is well discussed, but it\u2019s missing!\n"}
