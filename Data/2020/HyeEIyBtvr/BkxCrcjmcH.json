It is consisted of two phrases: in phrase 1, all path are uniformly trained to avoid bias, in phrase 2, less competitive options are pruned to save cost. The proposed method achieved the SOTA on IN mobile setting. \n\n\nOverall I found the idea proposed in the paper intuitive and convincing. Especially I appreciate the ablation study that identified one of the option is encouraged too much in the early stage will can lead to worse final performance. From the methodology perspective, I think this is a solid incremental contribution. However, the highlight of this paper, in my opinion, is the SOTA results on IN. My main concern is that the authors did not indicate that the code/model will be open sourced, which will help verification as well as reproducibility. "}
