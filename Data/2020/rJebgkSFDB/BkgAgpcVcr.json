The authors propose to learn adaptive kernels by meta variational random features, and evaluate their approach on different few-shot learning tasks, comparing it against recent meta-learning algorithms. \n\nThe paper is well-motivated and well-written. On page 8, the authors mention related works that were not included for comparison because they rely on pre-trained embeddings or large-scale deep architectures. It would have been interesting to see the difference in performance."}
