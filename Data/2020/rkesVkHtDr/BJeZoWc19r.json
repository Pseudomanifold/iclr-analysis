The authors frame the stepsize control problem as a learning problem, based on different performance measures, on ODE dependent inputs and on a LSTM for predicting the next step coefficient. Experiments are performed on 3 ODEs by training and testing in different contexts.\nThe problem of designing adaptive controllers for ODE numerical schemes is interesting and is probably a new application for ML. The paper makes an effort to introduce the necessary background and for reviewing some classical adaptive controller techniques. The description of the method is relatively clear, but could however be largely improved in order to make it more accessible to the audience.  Many of the arguments and proposed ideas come without justification, some definitions should be made more precise. The construction of the training and test sets should be better explained. The experiments show that the proposed approach leads to fewer evaluations but larger mean errors.  The graphics also show that the local error is smaller for the proposed method than for the baselines which is in contradiction with the global error behavior. This should be clarified \u2013 the relations between the two error types should be made clear.  The baseline is not defined in the text so that it is difficult to judge the performance. Why not comparing to several adaptive baselines?\n\nIn conclusion, this is an interesting topic, the paper proposes new ideas. A more careful writing and especially a better comparison with sota baselines would greatly improve the paper. \n"}
