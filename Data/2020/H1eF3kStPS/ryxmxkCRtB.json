The idea is simple and clear. The paper is well-written. However, major concerns are:\n\n1. This strategy is only for equal contribution models (e.g., GCN, GraphSAGE), not for methods which consider distinct contribution weights for individual node neighbor (e.g. GAT). However, in my opinion, for one target node, different neighbors should be assigned with different contributions instead of equal contributions.\n\n2. What kind of graphs can the proposed model be applied to? This paper seems to only consider unweighted undirected graphs. How about directed and weighted graphs? Even for an unweighted undirected graph, the symmetric information may also be redundant for further elimination. Then can HAG reduce this symmetric redundancy?\n\n3. There is no effectiveness evaluation comparing the original GNN models with the versions with HAG. The authors claim that, with the HAG process, the efficiency could be improved without losing accuracy. But there are no experimental results verifying that the effectiveness of the HAG-versions which could obtain comparable performance with the original GNN models for some downstream applications (e.g., node classification).\n"}
