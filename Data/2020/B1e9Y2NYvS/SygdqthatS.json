While ODEs are a classical subject in mathematics with many applications in the sciences and beyond, neural ODEs are a recently proposed family of models for nonlinear mappings in the context of machine learning systems. There they show promise and are an active field of research.\n\nThe paper makes two primary contributions. (1) It studies the robustness of neural ODE, and (2) proposes a more robust variant of neural ODEs. For (1), robustness to both perturbed and adversarial inputs is considered, and theoretical interpretations for the robustness of neural ODEs are given. These theoretical insights form the basis of the contribution in (2).\n\nThe paper is well and clearly written, supplies most of the necessary theoretical background and offers useful contributions. I recommend the paper for publication.\n\nIn terms of improving the paper further, I\u2019d suggest a slightly less casual treatment of the conditions under which the mathematical statements quoted hold. E.g. Theorem 1 is part of the classical Picard-Lindelof theorem and requires similar conditions (or at least the conditions of the necessary and sufficient, but less well known, Okamura's theorem, see [1]). A differentiable counterexample if these conditions don\u2019t hold can be found e.g. in Wikipedia [2]. I see that the authors have responded to that point on the openreview website. I\u2019d suggest however that for a result going back to the early 19th century citing a paper from 2019 (which itself cites a textbook on computational anatomy) seems suboptimal from an educational point of view.\n\nAnother possible improvement of the paper could be to expand the adversarial attacks considered to the gradient-free optimization techniques employed in e.g. [3] which have sharply reduced other defenses against adversarial attacks.\n\n[1] https://www.ams.org/journals/proc/1967-018-04/S0002-9939-1967-0212240-6/S0002-9939-1967-0212240-6.pdf\n[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picard\u2013Lindel\u00f6f_theorem#Example_of_non-uniqueness\n[3] https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05666"}
