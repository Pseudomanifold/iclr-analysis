I find that the paper has too few innovation in comparison with the approach introduced in Deshpande et al. (2019) (reference in the paper). The authors themselves described that the difference is \u2018instead of sorting the samples of the projections we iteratively select the most similar pairs of them for loss calculation\u2019. I think it is not enough for a publication. \n\nMinor suggestions: \n* Page 3. \u2018As it can be seen from the figure, for example\u2026\u2019 I think \u2018for example\u2019 here is redundant.

There must be a comma before \u2018otherwise\u2019. And maybe it would look better to write the equation as a system (with one left bra\u0441ket).\n* Section 3.2. There is \u2018Fig. ??\u2019"}
