It is based on a novel fractional filter for graph conv networks, which generalizes several previously employed graph semi-supervised learning frameworks, by introducing a fractional hyperparameter (sigma in the paper), using fractional powers of the Laplace operator.\n\nThe relevant previous work in the area seems to be cited, and the paper appropriately embedded in the previous work\n\nEmpirically, the method outperforms several established baseline models (classical and neural) on standard datasets in the node classification task. in particular one with a low number of labeled nodes. A sensitivity analysis is performed to assess the impact of the hyperparameters of the FGCN. \n\nI believe the experimental results could justify an accept, but I would not claim I am an expert in semi-supervised learning on graphs.\n\n\nQuestions:\n\nHow can the architecture be extended to handle edge types?\n\nHow were the hyperparameters of the baselines tuned?\n\nSmall things:\nCould you provide more context around the reliability in parallel systems (eq 11)? It is not clear how this relates to the rest of the paper.\n\nPlease add a citation for gated max average pooling.\n"}
