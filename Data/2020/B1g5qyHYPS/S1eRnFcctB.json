The main idea is to remove filters while not introducing intermediate channels not having either incoming weights or outgoing weights. The authors present experimental results for MobileNet V1 and MobileNet V2.\n\nThe main weakness is the novelty of the proposed algorithm. I think that the main idea is quite straight forward, which I believe a simple extension of ordinary convolutional filter pruning. Crucially, the experimental results are also weak. The proposed algorithm was not compared with any other pruning algorithm which is definitely not convincing to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. \n\nIn terms of the presentation, the paper is relatively well written. Especially, I appreciate the clear explanation of preliminaries (Section 3.1). There are some undefined notations in Section 3 (e.g., \\mathbf{F}, cluster)."}
