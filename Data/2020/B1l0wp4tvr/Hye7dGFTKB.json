Specifically, the authors try to tackle the convolutional neural networks, by propose a novel tensor-kernel based estimator. They use the proposed estimator to discover the similar trends on the information plane as the previous works.\n\nIn general, I think the introduction of the tensor kernels for mutual information estimation is the key contribution of this paper. However, I think this contribution is a little bit incremental, compared to the multivariate matrix-based version introduced by Yu et.al. In formula (7), the authors use the Frobenius distance of two tensors as the input of the kernal, which is equivalent to vectorize the tensor and use Euclidean distance. This approach does not capture the special structure of tensor and seems incremental. Also, the phenomenon of \"turning point\" on information plane for neural network has been challenged since its first publication. Despite its high citation, the deep meaning of this phenomenon has not been clearly studied. So an incremental change on computing such a questionable phenomenon make the contribution of this paper not very strong.\n\nSo I would like to give a weak reject. "}
