The regularizer is defined as the Kullback-Leibler divergence between a variational posterior for a negative sample and a marginal distribution over latents for negative data. The authors present experiments on MNIST and MNIST-like datasets, and CIFAR10 with SVHN. Unfortunately, I do not find the paper especially interesting. The motivation for adding the regularization term is not convincing. The experiments are insufficiently discussed.\n\nRemarks:\n- The paper proposes to ad a regularization to ELBO, namely, the Kullback-Leibler divergence between a variational distribution for a negative sample and a marginal distribution over latent variables for negative samples. I do not fully understand the motivation given on page 3. The authors show that including the negative data yields a new objective that is a sum of two log-lihelihood functions for \"real\" and negative data. However, later they propose to skip a (negative) reconstruction error term for the negative data. As a result, the authors obtain the objective they proposed. This explanation is very vague and I do not see what it adds to the story. Contrary, it causes new questions about their model and whether it is properly formulated.\nI suggest to look into the following paper to see whether the model could be re-formulated:\nHu, Z., Yang, Z., Salakhutdinov, R., & Xing, E. P. (2017). On unifying deep generative models. arXiv preprint arXiv:1706.00550.\n\n- I do not understand why the authors used Bernoulli distribution to model color and gray-scale images. The Bernoulli distribution could be used only for binary random variables. This is obviously flawed.\n\n- In general, the results seem to partially confirm claims of the paper, however, they are quite vague. First, utilizing a wrong distribution is demotivating (see my previous remark). Second, I miss a better description of models and, in general, experiments' setup. Third, all results are explained in a laconic manner (e.g., \"The other results in the table (...) confirm the assymetric behaviour of the phenomenon (...)\"). There is neither deeper understanding nor discussion provided.\n\n- Why there are no samples for CIFAR or SVHN provided?"}
