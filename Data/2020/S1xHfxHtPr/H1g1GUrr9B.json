The authors proposed to stack Quantization Modules while separating them during training to obtain an online compression system that has multiple resolutions, different memory horizons, and reduced catastrophic forgetting. They also proposed a modified reservoir sampling to accommodate this architecture. \n\nThe idea is very simple yet interesting, the paper is a good read, and the results seem promising. The ablation study is well designed but not discussed enough. Additionally, the experiments cannot support the idea well since it is on a very special setting, the LiDAR experiment is missing quantitative evaluation, and different tasks (such as text classification, or visual tracking with only one labeled sample) might introduce different difficulties in this online learning setting. I recommend a weak accept for this paper to encourage the idea. \n\nTherefore, I would recommend the authors to explore other tasks and see if their idea applies to different domains and tasks. Also, a quantitative evaluation for the LiDAR experiment with enough details and some explanation of the inner dynamics of the system during learning seems essential. \n\nThe paper could enjoy a pass of proofreading and typesetting (especially please pay attention to the correct use of \\cite{} and \\citep{}). Algorithm 1 is not mentioned in the body of the manuscript."}
