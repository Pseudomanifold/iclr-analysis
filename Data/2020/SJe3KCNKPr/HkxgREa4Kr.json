The authors propose a dual-module that is composed of a little module and big module. The big module use the full original data and parameters whereas the little module use small data and parameters by random projecting on the original ones. Through a statistical investigation, the authors provide a method to choose the little or big module dynamically. By applying this method on LSTM and GRU, the authors make them more efficient. Experimental results validate this point.\n\nOverall, I think this paper is well written and easy to follow. The idea of dual-module is interesting and wise. The experiments is valid. However, I would like the authors to answer me two questions. \n1 How do you draw Figure 2? \n2 Why is the distribution of the outputs of sigmoid not bipolar? Intuitively, the distribution should be similar to that of tanh since their functions are similar.\n"}
