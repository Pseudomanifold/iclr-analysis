Be positive and generous.\nThe paper proposes a new method for model selection in the case of classification with multiple labels. The method suggests not relying on average accuracy over all labels to choose a model but choosing multiple models depending on the label and apply them to the related samples.\n\nClearly state your decision (accept or reject) with one or two key reasons for this choice.\nReject.\n- I don't think the paper is contributing something new to the literature. Also there seems to be some confusion re: what accuracy means and is used in some places instead of precision.  (eg in. Sect. 4.1)\n\nProvide supporting arguments for the reasons for the decision.\n- One question I had was to think about is how one would know what model to apply to what samples if they don't know a priori the labels of these samples. This seems to be something your suggested approaches rely on.\n\nProvide additional feedback with the aim to improve the paper. Make it clear that these points are here to help, and not necessarily part of your decision assessment.\n- \"valid\" is used often instead of validation.\n"}
