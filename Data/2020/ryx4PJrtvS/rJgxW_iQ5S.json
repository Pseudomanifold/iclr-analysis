The method is to build a regression model based on Gaussian Copula distribution, which maps from hyperparameter to metric quantiles. The paper shows that by leveraging this estimation using some specific (sampling) strategies, it is able to improve over other BO methods.\n\nThe high-level idea of this paper seems sound to me -- that improves standard BO to generalize across datasets and metrics by learning a mapping between the space of hyperparameters and metrics. While I am not an expert in this area, the derivation looks sound to me, and the evaluation results of this paper are comprehensive to show that CGP seems to outperform a number of methods."}
