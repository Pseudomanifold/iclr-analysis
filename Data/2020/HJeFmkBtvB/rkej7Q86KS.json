It is a clear rejection due to its significant overlap with the recent NeurIPS publication [1]. The author(s) have failed to clarify how their proposal differs from [1] in a significant way. From what I can tell after a quick read, both papers tried to training the score function using the denoising auto-encoder, amortized through a neural network, strategically annealed with a sequence of different noise levels, sampled with the Langevin scheme. I put two papers side-by-side and you can visually tell the uncanny resemblance.  Additionally, the proposed model does not outperform that from [1] (see Table 1). I am also not happy about the misleading statement in the abstract that this work \"assign likelihood to test data\", which is actually performed by AIS.  Section 2.2 is particularly problematic. The assumption of \"data approximately uniformly distributed on the manifold\" is outrageous, which basically invalidates the need for density estimation because of the uniformity. The 1/f power law characteristic is irrelevant to the likelihood estimation problem, and the statements are both heuristic & misleading. \n\n[1] Y Song, S Ermon.
