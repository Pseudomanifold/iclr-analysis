This technique has been used before but only with limited success. The authors hypothesize that this is due to the fact that the matching was only performed over a single noise scale. The main idea of this work is to employ a range of scales to learn a single energy function. This trick helps to alleviate the problem of noisy samples concentrating in a low-volume region of the ambient space.\n\nIt seems that the paper draws significant inspiration from the work by Song & Ermon, 19. The difference between the two appears to be minor:\n1) The density is represented as a Boltzman distribution and therefore the score function is reduced to the gradient of the energy function (this has been done before)\n2) Instead of conditioning the energy on the noise level the authors propose to use explicit scaling by the inverse temperature\n \nPros:\n+ The paper is mostly well-written.\n+ I think Section 2 does a good job at illustrating challenges in training energy-based models using denoising score matching with a single noise scale. \n+ As compared to (Song & Ermon, 19) using the Boltzman distribution ensures that the learned score is an actual conservative vector field. Arguably, learning an image to scalar network is easier than learning an image to image one.\n+ Samples from the model are of competitive visual quality.\n\nCons:\n- Scaling energy by the inverse temperature seems to be one of the most important aspects of the paper but is only justified by \u201cintuition from physics\u201d. I\u2019m not entirely sure that this is a valid assumption. In contrast, (Song & Ermon, 19) don\u2019t put any hard constraints on the values of the score for different noise levels besides that they are produced by a single conditional network. I would appreciate if the authors discussed that difference in more detail.\n- The authors don\u2019t provide any analysis as to whether the annealed Langevin MC procedure leads to the samples from the right distribution.\n- The quantitative results don\u2019t seem to be better (actually, they are worse) than those from (Song & Ermon, 19).\n\nNotes/questions:\n* Abstract: \u201cunmormalized\u201d -> \u201cunnormalized\u201d\n* Section 2.1, (1): \\tilde{x} -> \\tilde{\\mathbf{x}}\n* Section 2.2, paragraph 2: What does superscript C mean in the noisy manifold? Never defined.\n* Section 2.2, paragraph 4: \u201csome example\u201d -> \u201csome examples\u201d (?)\n* Section 3, paragraph 1: \u201cCIFAT-10\u201d -> \u201cCIFAR-10\u201d\n* Section 4, paragraph 2: \u201cfor each T as a separate model\u201d. I don\u2019t think this is a correct statement. (Song & Ermon, 19) use a single conditional model for all the noise levels.\n* Section 4, paragraph 2: \u201cdoes not rely on explicit receive noise magnitude\u201d -> \u201cdoes not rely on receiving noise magnitude explicitly\u201d (?) I also don\u2019t quite understand this entire sentence. Does the model really infer the noise magnitude from a given image? It seems like in Equation (7) there is an assumption that the temperature T is equal to 1. I don\u2019t feel like there is a lot of difference between the proposed model and (Song & Ermon, 19) when it comes to supplying noise information. I\u2019d appreciate if the authors could clarify that bit for me.\n\nMy main concern about this paper is that it doesn\u2019t seem like a big step from its starting point (Song & Ermon, 19). The modifications are shown to work empirically but don\u2019t result in a significantly better model. Moreover, I feel like the paper could do a better job at justifying those changes. I\u2019m giving a borderline score but willing to increase it if the authors address my questions."}
