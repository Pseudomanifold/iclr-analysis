The idea is not very novel since several previous work have tried the mixture of flow such as the mentioned RAD and Deep Mixture. The paper studies some further improvements such as using the continuous auxiliary variable and stacking multiple mixture layers. \n\nThe major concerns are the following:\n\n1) The paper tries to solve a \u201cproblem\u201d build upon intuition. The paper explains as \u201cthe normalizing flow places global constraint on the bijection\u201d, \u201cit need to match the topology of  X to the topology of Z \u201d, \u201ccontinuous functions necessarily preserve topology\u201d. What kind of topological properties are referred to here? Are all topological properties preserved under continuous function? It needs to be more accurate when using such terminologies. The intuition of the paper is weak and heuristic. The example in Figure 1 can potentially be easily solved with a two component Gaussian mixture of input Z to a vanilla flow model.\n\n2) For the mixture p(X), will the proposed method generate samples concentrated on one or some of the components? Why or why not?\n\n3) Considering there are a plenty of improvements of flow models, it is neccesary for the proposed method to compare with, at least for some methods explained in the Related Work section.\n\n4) Since the proposed methods inevitably lose the advantage of analytic density property of flow methods, it is better to show some advantage over implicit or semi-implicit methods. For example, (https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.11183) also uses a hierarchical model with continuous auxiliary variables and a marginalization similar to Eq.(4) in this paper. How does the proposed method related to or compared to these methods?\n\n5) In experiment section, in Table 1, the proposed method is worse than MAF for 2 datasets out of 4? In Table 2, what are the numbers refer to?\n\n6) On page 4, it should be p(U|Z) not p(U|X)?\n\nIn sum, I think though the paper makes contribution on exploring better flow models but the novelty is relatively weak, the discussion and comparison of related work is insufficient and the experiments are not convincing or have mistakes. I think a modification is necessary before publishing.\n\n\n\n"}
