Also, to better describe the distribution of latent code, the authors involve VIB to constraint the latent code.\n\nThe whole pipeline is clear and makes sense. And the experiment proves it's effective. \n\nHowever, in my eyes, it's almost like an extension of VaDE which combines VIB and GMM too. The main difference is the authors use some hyperparameters to control the optimization of the whole model and make some more proper hypothesis. All of those make sense but may not contribute much to the research field."}
