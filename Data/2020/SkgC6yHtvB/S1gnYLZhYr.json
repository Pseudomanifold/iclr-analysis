For this reason, they propose an image embedding framework by transferring the computation from Euclidean space to the hyperbolic space. The work is closely related to hyperbolic neural networks. Experimental results on several benchmarks show the performance of the proposed model. \n\nMy main concern is regarding the motivation and the technical contribution of this paper. \n(1) the example of MINIST in Fig. 1 can not well support the argument of this paper. Why MNIST (digits) exhibit a hierarchical data distribution? Why using Poincare embedding is beneficial for image classification in MINIST? In contrast, I like the examples shown in Fig. 2.\n(2) the technical contribution of this paper is not clear. The authors simply generalize some distance or averaging functions from Euclidean space to the hyperbolic space for learning the Poincare embedding, let along [Ganea et al., 2018] is already published in the literature. \n(3) In the experiments, the authors may want to provide more discussion about why hyperbolic embedding is necessary for the studied datasets.
