The extension involves hierarchic communities of annotators, where the number of communities grows with data via \"Dirichlet process mixture based on a stick-breaking representation of the underlying Dirichlet process\".\n\nThe paper is very well-written and the results are convincing. Experiments pack appropriate breadth of comparison and the discussion is relatively extensive. THe coverage of related work is extensive and the contribution placement apt. The paper does not state the language(s); it seems to be English-only, and it is not clear how the model would scale up/down with the number of languages or limited availability of resources.\n\nI see no major issues with accepting the paper."}
