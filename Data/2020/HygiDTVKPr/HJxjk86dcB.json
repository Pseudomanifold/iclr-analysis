Different from the conventional crowdsourcing approaches that concentrate on classification tasks with predefined classes, the proposed Community MPA, as an extension of MPA can address anaphoric annotation well where coders relate markables to coreference chains whose number cannot be predefined. Authors demonstrate that on a recent large-scale crowdsourced anaphora dataset, the proposed Community MPA works better than the unpooled counterpart in conditions of sparsity, and on par when enough observations are available. It also generalizes well to other crowdsourcing tasks under different settings.\n\n* The paper is an incremental work to the existing one by Paun et al. (2018b). It considers the underlying communities of different workers, which may lead to better annotations when the data is scarce.\n* It is also partially similar to the Moreno et al. (2015) that models a latent number of communities through Gibbs sampling. The proposed method also shows comparable performance compared to Moreno et al. (2015) in standard annotation tasks.\n* Technically, the paper is written well (I appreciate detailed deduction in the appendix), but is hard to follow for people not from the crowdsourcing field. There are lots of field-specific terms without much explanation. It may take quite a while for readers with only machine learning background.\n* The complexity of the work is not explicitly explained. While the solution itself refers to (Blei et al., 2017), it would be better to show running time in experiments.\n* Authors claimed that \u201cWe let the number of communities grow with the data, a flexibility that we achieve using a Dirichlet process mixture,\u201d but this is not clear in the modeling in section 2.1. Which parameters control such increases and how they were adjusted? More explanations are needed."}
