The beta-VAE, soft attention and policy are trained on appropriate source tasks and evaluated zero-shot on target tasks, using two more difficult continuous control domains with RGB observations. Results indicate some improvements to compared to the immediate relevant baseline which may be statistically significant, but it is not clear whether over 10% in practice. \n\nI cannot at this stage recommend acceptance for the following reasons:\n1) The paper augments an existing method with a well understood attention mechanism, so the novelty of the approach is relatively low.\n2) The experimental results are interesting, but I don't find them compelling enough to recommend acceptance based on the results alone.  The paper does not solve a major problem with the approach it is based on. In fact, the improvement seems to be smaller when the environment is more complex.\n3) Several baselines which are cited in the paper are actually missing in the experiments, so it is hard to determine how important is that roughly 10% improvement compared to SOTA.\n\n"}
