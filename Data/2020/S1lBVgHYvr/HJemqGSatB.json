The paper provides bounds for the minimum number of queries needed for the attacker to attack the classifier successfully and then the authors prove that they can devise a defender to be robust against that attack. Here are a few points to consider:\n1.\tThe paper is a bit difficult to understand (also not well-structured). The specific contributions are not quite clear with respect to the existing literature (which is reviewed in a sparse manner in the paper). Especially, the novelty of the theory and analysis presented here is a bit difficult to assess. \n2.\t The results are not really validating the points they make in the analysis (for example in part 4.2 they talk about upper and lower bounds for number of queries as a function of \u03c4, \u03b1, etc. but they never provide some plots or tables regarding that in the results section).\n4.\tAlso, in Fig 2, it is hard to grasp the performance of the defended vs undefended classifiers with respect to the lower and upper bound that they have computed theoretically in the previous section.\n5.\tThey emphasize on the \u201cdefensibility\u201d and \u201cquery privacy\u201d in the analysis but they do not provide anything in the results section considering them.\n6.\tAs this is primarily a theoretical paper, focusing on simple classifiers is probably okay, but some sort of empirical comparison with other certified defense strategies is necessary. Just claiming that none of the existing methods would work for unrestricted attacks will not work is not sufficient. Some empirical results to show the specific advantages (e.g., at what budget the existing methods start to fail and the proposed method continues to perform well). "}
