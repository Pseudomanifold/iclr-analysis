Concretely, the authors improve CPC in terms of its architecture and training strategy. The extensive experiments show that CPC enables data-efficient image classification and surpassed other unsupervised approaches. \n\n[Pros]\n- Although the CPC was proposed and evaluated in vision task in [1], a new implementation of CPC with dramatically-improved ability is presented in this paper.\n- The CPC is utilized to enhance spatially predictable representations which benefits a lot data-efficient image recognition.\n\n[Cons]\n- In Sec. 4.1, four axes are identified to upgrade CPC v1 to CPC v2. But they are not well motivated. More discussions about why this four axes are investigated in image recognition.\n\n-The core idea is motivated by a critical hypothesis that good representations should make spatio-temporal variability in natural signals more predictable. However, this hypothesis is not well verified. The concept of amount of \u2018predictability\u2019 in page 7 is not clear. It would be great if you provide more evidence that the improvement in low-data classification results from the increased \u2018predictability\u2019.\n\n- The comparison in Sec. 4.3 seems unfair. The pretrain model trained with different methods should be the same. For example, the Faster RCNN trained on CPC v2 uses ResNet-101 as backbone but Local Aggregation method uses ResNet-50.\n\n[Summary]\n- This work extends CPP to data-efficient image recognition by simply adjusting network architectures and training strategies, which makes it less interesting. Besides, the major hypothesis is not well validated. \n- The experimental results are convincing and encouraging. Some minor flaws such as unfair comparison should be fixed.\n- I want to see how the four axes in Sec. 4.1 are related to core motivation (more predictable) since they are major adjustments from CPP v1 to CPP v2. If the author provides a profound explanation of the problem, I would consider changing the rating. \n"}
