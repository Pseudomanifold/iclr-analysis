Essentially, the model leans the many-to-many mapping between the cell types and different protein markers' expression levels. Compared with the other mainstream GAN methods, the authors show the proposed method, CCIGAN, can outperform them in terms of generating the expression map of different protein markers given the segmentation of cell types. The manuscript also has an in-depth discussion of the biological meaning of the learned model as well as the learned vectors. \n\nI personally like this manuscript a lot, considering the novelty and the thoroughness of the manuscript. However, I have the following concerns: \n\nMajor concern (The score will be significantly improved if the authors can handle these two concerns during revision): \n1. My largest concern is how useful the proposed method is. It seems the wet experiments are mature. How can the computational synthesized image help the biologists then? Are there any cases that only the CCIGAN can do while the real experiment can not do? I am not an expert in MIBI-TOF, but I guess all the results in Section 6.2 can be easily achieved with the real data, right? \n2. CCIGAN is indeed better than the other methods, but would it be accepted by the biologists in terms of performance? Would they believe in the results? In fact, in the last column of Figure 2, we can see clear artifacts for the results generated by CCIGAN.\n\n\nMinor concern:\n1. What's the resolution of the MIBI-TOF and CCIGAN?\n2. The introduction of the background could be further refined. The many-to-many mapping between different cell types and different protein markers is not emphasized explicitly. Readers can get lost easily. \n3. The data part is not clear. How many M*2048*2048 images do the authors have for training as well for testing? \n4. Why do the authors choose 64*64 as the image path size?\n5. Can the model be generalized well for data collected in different experiments (i.e., different tissues) but from the same machine? Can the model be generalized well across different machines with the same imaging experimental setting?\n6. Is the model sensitive to the preprocessing of the data, like normalization? As for as I know, the baseline expression level of tissue can vary significantly at different time points within one day. If the model is sensitive to that, it will affect the usage of the model."}
