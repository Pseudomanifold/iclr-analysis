They propose an interesting architecture design with protein-specific attention to find association between cell types and neighboring pattens and cell-cell interactions. They also propose new and biologically interpretable metrics including a reconstruction metric, projected EMD and regressing of expression on neighbors.\n\nThey present improved reconstruction of interactions compared to other models in the context of PD-1 and PD-L1 interactions. It would be great to extend the evaluation to other interactions and tissue types.\n\nOverall the paper is well written, the application and especially the focus on cell-cell interactions is novel. The model is properly justified and evaluated, and there is a high demand for this framework in the multiplexed imaging field.\n"}
