This significantly speeds up the status quo in training BERT model, and effectively reduces the training time from original 3 days to only 76 minutes. In addition to demonstrating superior results across various tasks in practice, the paper also provides theoretical convergence analysis on LAMB optimizer.  \n\nOverall, this paper has made sound contributions that enables BERT-alike language to be trained with significant speedups, which is not otherwise achievable through LARS. The paper is well written and structured. I recommend acceptance. \n"}
