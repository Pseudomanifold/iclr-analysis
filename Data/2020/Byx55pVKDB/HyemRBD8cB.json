Based on this observation, the authors proposed 2-logit based detectors and showed that they outperform the detectors utilizing softmax activations using MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.\n\nI\u2019d like to recommend \"reject\" due to the following\n\nThe main observation (removing softmax activation can be useful for detecting abnormal samples) is a bit interesting (but not surprising) but there is no theoretical analysis for this. It would be better if the authors can provide the reason why softmax activation hinders the novelty detection.\n\nThe logit-based detectors proposed in the paper are simple variants of existing methods. Because of that, it is hard to say that technical contributions are very significant.\n\nQuestions\n\nFor evaluation, could the authors compare the performance with feature-based methods like Mahalanobis [1] and LID [2]?\n\nI would be appreciated if the author can evaluate their hypothesis using various datasets like CIFAR-100, SVHN, and ImageNet.\n\n[1] Lee, K., Lee, K., Lee, H. and Shin, J., 2018.
