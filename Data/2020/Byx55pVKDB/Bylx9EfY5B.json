The main reason for this is of course the normalization used by the softmax. The paper is mostly empirical following this specific observation, and uses a number of examples on MNIST and CIFAR to show the improvement in performance by using unnormalized logits instead of softmax.\n\nWhile interesting, it is to be noted that methods such as ODIN and temperature scaling specifically include a temperature to exactly overcome this same issue with softmax. The lack of comparison to such baselines makes this paper quite incomplete, especially as it is an empirical paper itself. "}
