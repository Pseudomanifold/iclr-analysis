This helps reduce time and costs to collect a huge amount of data from industrial machines and improve accuracy. Although the paper idea is very interesting when presenting a new learning model for graph data, explanations and experiments are not convincing. \n\nFor explanations, the authors did not provide sufficient related works or references to prove that the problem the paper wants to solve is important. Also, for some approaches using deep learning mentioned there are no references.\n\nFor experiments, the results presented in Table 1 are good but there are no official baselines (e.g. from some prior works) to make the comparison more reliable.\n\nBase on the arguments mentioned above, the paper is not convincing and reliable.\n\nSmall suggestion revision: \nMore analysis of prior works to show that the problem is important and need-to-solve\nThe introduction section should more references.\nThe experiments should be rigorous cause it lacks reliable baselines for comparison.  \n"}
