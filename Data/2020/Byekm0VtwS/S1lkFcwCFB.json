The authors present experimental results on MNIST and CIFAR-10 demonstrating the utility of their approach. \n\nOverall the quality of the presentation and the exposition in the paper is poor. I am also not convinced about the novelty and importance of this work.  Calibrating neural network uncertainty has been explored quite thoroughly in the bayesian neural nets community - I do not see comparisons with existing work on this subject or justification/explanation of why this work is better than other prior work on this topic.
