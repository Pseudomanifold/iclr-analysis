The paper is not at all well written and the contributions very questionable. The paper lacks a conclusion where the main contribution are mentioned and backup. Figures and illustrations are not the best.  From my point of view, this paper is a clear rejection. \n\nI would encourage the authors to be explicit about their contribution and the intellectual products of this work. In addition, I would encourage them the identify comparable methods if any and explicitly enumerate the advantages of their approach against prior work/methods. "}
