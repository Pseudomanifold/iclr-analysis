The paper would be greatly improved by adding:\n- an intuitive paragraph in the intro that explains a concrete example of DS high level, but with enough details for the reader to grasp the idea)\n- adding a new section right after related work (and before the current \"3. Models\") in which you present in great detail (and with concrete & complete examples) the two main DS techniques that are used in the experiments; with that solid understanding \n\n\nOther comments:\n- for sake of simplicity & understand-ability, you should avoid the use of the term \"soften positive examples\"  in the abstract\n- avoid using the term \"unbelievable\" (one in abstract & twice in intro\"\n- the last paragraph before \"Conclusion\" seems to refer to an earlier version of Figure 4, which, in its current form, does NOT \nhave S(pos,E) or the word \"interesting\""}
