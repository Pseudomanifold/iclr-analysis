The CNN they used is simple and standard. Apparently this paper no novelty at all. They just apply CNN to a new task. This kind of work is not qualified for ICLR at all.\n\nThere are also some problems in paper organization. They should split the introduction part into several paragraphs to improve reading experience. And it seems that they forget to add reference part.\n\nGiven the quality of the writing and content, I decide to reject this paper."}
