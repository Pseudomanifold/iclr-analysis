The formatting of the paper needs work, and the work is not substantially novel.\n\nFor some reason, many sections of the paper were ill-formatted, perhaps due to using an insufficiently portable submission format. In addition, though the paper cited a few references throughout, the final reference list was not available. In addition, handwritten character recognition, by itself, is not a new field, and the authors did not contribute sufficiently to the underlying theory or mechanics. Characters with arguably the same level of complexity, such as Chinese characters, have been thoroughly explored. The application of existing technology to a different script does not, by itself, compel me to feel that this is an ICLR worthy paper.\n\nIn the future, the authors might wish to show how their particular architecture (or processes) might be better suited to their task than other architectures, or show how they have, in some way, improved the science of character recognition. That being said, I think it is quite notable the effort that went into creating the data set for Amharic character recognition. I would encourage the authors to distribute this data set so that others may join in the research efforts."}
