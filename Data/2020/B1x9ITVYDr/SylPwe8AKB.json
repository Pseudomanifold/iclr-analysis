The authors provide theoretical analysis for several recovery algorithms (IHT, BP, DS) and provide experimental result on CIFAR-10, MNIST and Fashion-MNIST. \n\nMy major concern is how significant the provided results are. It is indeed interesting to extend the compressive sensing framework to handle l1 and l2 attacks. However, the proposed recovery algorithms are all classical ones, and it is unclear how novel the analysis is, since the authors do no discuss the technical challenges they overcome or the difference between their proof techniques and the previous ones. Also, it would be nice if the authors could discuss the theoretical results in more detail, e.g., how to interpret them and new insights it brings to us. \n\nMoreover, some experimental details are missing. In last paragraph in Section 3.1, the authors say ``We then use both x and x\u2032 to train the network''. How do you do so? Just add both x and x' to the training set? "}
