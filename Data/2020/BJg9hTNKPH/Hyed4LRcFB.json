The authors generalize existing offline RL approaches to an actor-critic algorithm that regularizes the learned policy such that it can stay close to the behavior policy. Based on prior work, the authors state that there are two variants of regularizations to the behavior policy, value penalty (vp) and policy regularization (pr) and three choices of divergence functions along with their sample estimate that measures the distance between the learned policy and the behavior policy. The paper empirically investigates the effectiveness of each regularization scheme as well as each divergence function and conclude that vp is slightly more effective than pr while all divergence functions have similar performances.\n\nOverall, this paper could be an interesting summary of prior works in offline RL and provide some empirical insights on the effectiveness of each building block in the previous approaches, though it neither offers theoretical explanations nor proposes a new offline RL algorithm that outperforms the existing methods under the BRAC framework. My score would be increased given some technical insights or some promising results in a relatively novel offline RL algorithm in the author\u2019s response. \n\nSpecifically, the paper does a thorough ablation study on BEAR, BCQ, and KL-control within the BRAC framework. While the experimental results demonstrate some interesting phenomenons such as combining vp and the primal form of KL divergence achieving the best performance and taking minimum over Q functions outperforming using a mix of maximum and minimum over the Q functions, I believe the paper would be greatly improved if the authors can provide a new offline RL method based on the BRAC that can achieve better performance than current approaches and is less incremental than simply combining vp and KL divergence. \n\nThough BRAC summarizes offline RL methods in a neat way, it would be more technically sound if a general theoretical analysis/insights of offline RL algorithms can be offered in the paper, e.g. showing the reason that vp is outperforming pr through convergence analysis in the tabular case.\n\nMinor comment:\nError bars should be added to the all the bar plots."}
