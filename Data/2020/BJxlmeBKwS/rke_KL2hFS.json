A major challenge compared to existing work is to have an algorithm with nearly zero delay while preserving detection accuracy. A deep convolutional neural network is trained for this purpose and it is validated on TIMIT dataset.\n\nAfter a careful preprocessing of the data, long segments of raw audio are given as input to the convolutional net. It is trained as a binary classification problem. Therefore, for each different phenome, a different network is needed. To improve the accuracy, Majority voting is also adopted. This however increases the computational cost. To address this issue, an extrapolation detection problem is formulated to predict the fricative phoneme a few ms in advance. Extensive numerical results show that the approach still outperforms the method of Ruinskiy & Lavner (2014) in Unweighted Average Recall. \n\nI find the accuracy attained by the neural nets quite impressive, although more insights would be favored to understand what is going on. This is yet an interesting application of deep learning useful for real-life problems. If the method could be tested on another dataset, the result would be more convincing. \n"}
