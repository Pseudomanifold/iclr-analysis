It uses\ntwo stream neural networks, one for instance classification and one\nfor learning normalized weights. The proposed method can be used for\nbinary and multi-class bag classification.\n\nThe authors experimentally show the performance of their proposed\nmethod on several datasets and compare against other state-of-the-art\nmethods. Also they created a new data set for multi-class bag\nclassification.\n\nThe results are very convincing but the description of the method is\nnot very clear. In particular, the description of the instance\nclassifier is confusing. It says that \"f\" is the instance classifier,\nwhich is a composition of a feature extractor (\\phi) and a classifier\n(\\psi), both modeled as deep neural networks. What are those neural\nnetworks? \n\nAlso the weighting function is a composition of three functions, the\nGaussian normalization, the instance weighting, and the feature\nextractor. Again the instance weighting process, which is another key\nfeature of the paper, is not clearly explained. \n\nThe paper has several English errors which makes sometimes difficult\nto follow all the ideas. \n"}
