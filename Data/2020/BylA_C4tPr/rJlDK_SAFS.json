The framework comprises of node/relation embedding, nonparametric compositional operation as in knowledge graph embedding, and finally convolution operation with direction specific weight matrices. The performance is evaluated on link prediction, and node/graph classification tasks.\n\nOverall, the paper is well written and literature is sufficiently discussed. The performance of the proposed model on the diverse tasks looks good.  I have just two minor comments:\n\n1. The difference and overlap with Schlichtkrull et al. (2017) should be more elaborated on. Right now, the paper reads that the main difference is only in employing the basis representation for initial relation features in your work.\n\n2. There are some inconsistencies in Table 2. For example, H@3 for SCAN is same as COMPGCN for FB15k dataset. Also, for WN18RR dataset, MR of ConvKB is better but it's not in boldface!"}
