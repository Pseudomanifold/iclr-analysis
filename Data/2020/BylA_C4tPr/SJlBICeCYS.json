Therefore, although the idea is quite incremental, the overall work is well written and experiments with ablation study on different model\u2019s components bring the value into it.\n\nMinor comments:\n- In table 2 SACN method outperforms COMPGCN based on H@10 (0.54 vs 0.535) for FB15k-237 dataset, but not highlighted with bold.\n- Authors write: \u201climited to embedding only the nodes of the graph\u201d about Weighted Graph Convolutional Network (Shang et al., 2019), however that paper in fact does relation embeddings (see. e.g. figure 1 in that paper). The block at the bottom of the figure 1 called \"Relation Embedding\". I would propose to discuss this issue and comment on exact differences/similarities with the proposed approach.\n"}
