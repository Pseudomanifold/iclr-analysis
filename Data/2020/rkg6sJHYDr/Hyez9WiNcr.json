The fitness is the closeness of a generated set of latents to a set of latents produced through one of several possible processes; hand-design, pretraining, or online training on previously generated CA settings. \n\nThe core results are in Figures 27 to 31 in an appendix. Initial inspection reveals that handdesigned goal states produce the most interesting non-animal patterns. With regard to animal forms, it appears to me that Online goal learning harms the diversity of animal forms considerably compared to PGL and perhaps HGS. High frequency spatial structure seems to be lost there. \n\nI would like to see a further analysis of maybe 10000s of such images generated, and an understanding of exactly why RGS produces the same kind of red linear patterns, and why HGS produces the distribution of pattern types in Figure 29, and why non-animal types differ in PGL vs HGS, and why high frequency spatial structure is lost in OGL. How robust are these over many runs? The results should NOT be shown just for the first repetition of the experiment but for all independent runs of the experiments, e.g averaged over 30 independent CPPN evolutions, for PGL, OGL, Random, and HGS! \n\n"}
