These models use a autoregressive teacher (AT), which typically perform better. However, AT models can not be parallelized that easily such as the NAT models. The distillation has the effect of removing modes from the dataset which helps the NAT models as they suffer from the averaging effect of maximum likelihood solutions. The authors analyze why such distillation is needed and what the effect of the complexity of the training set is and further propose 3 methods to adjust the complexity of the teacher to the complexity of the NAT model.\n\nThe paper is well written and easy to understand and the experiments are exhaustive and well done. I think the analysis using the synthetic dataset is nice, but I am not sure how surprising the results are. I think most of it has to be expected given the properties of maximum likelihood estimation. Hence, I think the contribution of the paper is a bit limited. I am, however, not an expert in the field to fully judge the contribution and will therefore put low confidence on my review. "}
