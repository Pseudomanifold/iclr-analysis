The analysis is based on the proposed Perceptual Efficacy (PE) Score that measures spatial frequency and orientation selectivity of CNN features. The hypothesis put forward by the authors is that a CNN features with high PE score can be used to formulate a perceptual loss (Eq. 1) that correlates well with human image quality judgement. The authors use a dataset of human image quality judgements to assess their hypothesis. \n\nOne issue I see with the hypothesis as stated is that in the definition of frequency selective features, the authors make use of\nthe Contrast Sensitivity Function (CSF) which quantifies the dependency of human perceptual characteristics on frequency. So in the definition of the PE score we have embedded knowledge of human perceptual sensitivity. Is it therefore surprising  that we see correlation between the high PE features and human judgements of quality? \n\nExperimental results: The scatterplot presented in Figure 4 does not say to me what the authors claim it should. I do not see a significant difference between the low-PE features and the high-PE features in terms of their correlation with human image quality judgement (as measures in this case by the DMOS). I also find the large table of number in Table 1 to be rather\nimpenetrable. I would recommend an alternative method of presentation to make the desired point.  \n\nClarity: There are many undefined terms and acronyms (eg. SISR, HVS are not defined, while DMOS and SROCC are not described). Also, the description of visual masking in Sec. 4.3 was confusing and difficult to follow. Otherwise the writing was reasonably clear.\n\nImpact and significance: Overall, the findings of the paper are not terribly surprising and as discuss above, given the use of the CSF (quantifying human perceptual characteristics) in the definition of the CNN Perceptual Efficacy (PE) score, it would seem rather surprising that a correlations would not be found. As a result of this as well as the rather narrow nature of the study involved, I am inclined to think that the impact potential of this paper would be rather low. "}
