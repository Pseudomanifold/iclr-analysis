It proposes to characterize each DNN feature in terms of two well known properties of the human visual system: a) sensitivity to changes in visual frequency and b) orientation selectivity. Both properties are evaluated with respect to the known human Contrast Sensitivity Function (CSF) and measured empirically from the feature\u2019s response to (oriented) sinusoidal gratings. The results are quantified by a composite score termed Perceptual Efficacy (PE).\nIn a set of comprehensive experiments (several pre-trained DNNs, several layers per DNN and two different datasets of distorted images with human perceptual quality annotations) it is demonstrated that feature representation consisting of a layer\u2019s features with high PE better agree with human perceptual quality judgments than low PE feature representations from the same layer.\n\nI believe the submission convincingly demonstrates a statistical association between the proposed PE score of a DNN feature and human perceptual quality assessments.\nThough, it remains unclear whether the characteristics captured by the PE score are necessary or sufficient to explain the success of DNNs to guide image generation tasks by providing a perceptual loss function.\nFor that I believe it is necessary to demonstrate that the present empirical results can be used to improve results of an image generation task, e.g. super-resolution. \nFurthermore the limits of the PE score could be explored by hand-crafting image representations with maximal PE score and comparing their usefulness in guiding e.g. a super-resolution task compared to a pre-trained DNN.\n\nThus, overall I believe the submission reports interesting initial results but falls short of showing that they capture general properties that can be transferred to improving perceptual loss functions.
