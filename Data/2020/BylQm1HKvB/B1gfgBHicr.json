It extends the two-agent description game, which agents swap between Teacher and Student roles (\u201cobverter technique\u201d) into a multi-agent game in which messages can be rejected.\n\nThere are problems with clarity, particularly after page 4 (Sections 3.2 and 3.3), starting with the paragraph about how their architecture differs from the preexisting architectures. The lack of line numbers in the submission makes it impractical to give detailed feedback.\n\nOverall I have had a lot of difficulty understanding the proposed method, and would have needed more time (or more background knowledge) in order to properly evaluate this paper."}
