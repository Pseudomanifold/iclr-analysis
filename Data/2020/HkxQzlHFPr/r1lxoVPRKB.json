The submission misses the major literature of and comparison to previous work that uses FOL for natural language inference (aka. RTE), for example, [Bos and Markert \u201805], [Beltagy et al. \u201813], [Abzianidze \u201817], among others, as well as work based on natural logic, e.g., [MacCartney \u201809], which operates directly on parsed sentences. The submission contains little contribution with regard to the exiting work. Key concepts such as \u201csuperficial semantics\u201d is vague and not well defined. I do not recommend it for the conference. \n\nBos and Markert \u201805, Recognising Textual Entailment with Robust Logical Inference. \nBeltagy et al. \u201813, Montague Meets Markov: Deep Semantics with Probabilistic Logical Form.\nAbzianidze \u201917, A Natural Proof System for Natural Language.\nMacCartney \u201909, natural language inference (PhD thesis)\n"}
