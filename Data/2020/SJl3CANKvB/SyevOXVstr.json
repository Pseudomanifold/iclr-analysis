They consider the deep metric learning setup, where target distances are defined as the euclidean distances in an artificial feature space (created by a deep neural network). Main focus of the paper is to cases where the data set is affected by a substantial imbalance between the amount of examples that are similar to each other and the total number of examples.\n\nI would tend to accept the paper because handling the imbalance problem in metric learning is important and both the theoretical analysis and the experiments show that the proposed method may have some impact.\n\nThe idea of reducing the problem to a binary classification between similar and dissimilar examples may look too simple but i) is a common approach in deep metric learning, ii) helps to handle the implicit imbalance problem and iii) suggests possible generalisations to other network-based problems (for example, where similarity is naturally defined by the existence of absence of a link). Showing that many complicated losses are equivalent to DRO may also help the general understanding of the metric learning task.\n\nMy main concerns are about the net contribution of the paper. Tackling the imbalance problem is important but it is not clear whether the full metric learning setup is really needed. The authors could have stated more precisely in what sense the metric learning unbalanced problem they consider is different from usual unbalanced binary classification. Otherwise, as DRO is well known, it is hard to identify the real novelty of their method.\n\nQuestions: \n- how does the specific metric learning setup make the considered DRO different from usual unbalanced classification? \n- how the network architecture affects the performance? For example, would the size of the embedding space change the recall/imbalance plot? \n- Is the choice of euclidean distances standard in deep metric learning? Would a choice of more general distances be incorporated in the proposed method?\n \n"}
