Using ideas from distributionally robust optimization, the loss (in each batch) is the worst case weighted average of all pairwise classification losses, taken over an uncertainty set of possible weights. The framework is shown to be general and encompass various previous approaches. Based on it, the authors propose several new algorithms, which are shown to outperform the SOTA on image retrieval data sets in terms of recall.\n\nThe main contribution of the paper is a unification of previous deep metric learning algorithms, which would be helpful to the community and could inspire new approaches. I found the empirical observation that the proposed algorithms are able to reduce the computation time by nearly half to be compelling. However, apart from DRO-TopK-PN, the proposed algorithms appear to be minor modifications of existing algorithms. \n\nQuestions about the experimental protocol:\n1. Are the results from one run, or averaged over several? Standard errors of the evaluation metrics would be very helpful to judge the improvements made by the algorithms, especially as the algorithms are stochastic due to batching. \n2. The proposed algorithms seem to be similar to those of Fan et al. (2017) and Namkoong and Duchi (2017). Is there a particular reason why they weren\u2019t included in the experiments? "}
