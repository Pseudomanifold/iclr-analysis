The paper is well organized. \n2. The theoretical part is completed and experiments are done on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, GTS, CIFAR-10. \n3. The proposed method presents a significant improvement over SOTA. \n\nWeakness:\n1. The author should provide more empirical analysis on the MMR regularization, like how it changes during the training process. \n2. The captions of the table and figure are too small. \n"}
