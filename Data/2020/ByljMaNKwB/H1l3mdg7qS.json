First this paper proposes a new theory for this domain that extends generalized discrepancy theory to multi-source setting. After derive a new generalization bound, this paper also proposes a new method based on the theory. Evaluation on real world datasets are proposed to show the efficiency of the proposed method.\n\n+ The theory in this paper improve bounds for multi-source DA in previous paper. The new bound provides new insight and helps the design of algorithm.\n+ This paper proposes elegant method to tackle new terms in the loss function and gives its complexity analysis. \n+ The evaluation results show that the algorithm is efficient.\n\nComments:\n- The main contribution of the proposed theory is the alpha term. Is \\eta_{\\mathcal{H}} is a better estimation that previous adaptability term in multi-source DA? What is the role of \\eta_{\\mathcal{H}} in the algorithm design? How to control it in empirical algorithm?\n- The evaluation of the proposed method is not complete. Some baseline DA methods [A, B] and datasets [C, D] are not considered. \n\n[A] S.
