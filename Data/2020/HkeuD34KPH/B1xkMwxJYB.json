Specifically, the authors mainly follow the previous works of the Transformer model and the stochastic shared embedding (SSE) regularization technique. For the part of the personalized transfer (PT), the authors introduce the user embedding for each user $i$, i.e., $u_i$, shown in Eq.(2) and illustrated in Figure 1. For the part of regularization, the authors find that the SSE technique works well in terms of avoid overfiting in context of other regularization techniques.\n\nExtensive empirical studies on five datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared with other related methods.\n\nOverall, the paper is very well presented, in particular of the introduction and discussion about the related works, and the analysis of the experimental results. \n\nMy major concern is that the technical novelty is somehow limited in terms of the two closely related works of Transformer and stochastic shared embedding (SSE). I thus recommend weak acceptance.\n\nSome suggestion: Some important baseline methods may be included to make the results more convincing, e.g., Fossil, MARank, and/or BERT4Rec.\n\nSome minors:\nTypo: in the paragraph below Eq.(3): user $l$ -> user $i$\nTypo: FPMF, PFMC in different places\n"}
