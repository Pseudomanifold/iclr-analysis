It discusses the privacy concerns thoroughly and look at language modeling as a representative task. They find that there are plenty of cases namely when the composition of the sequences involve low frequency words, that a lot of information leak occurs.\n\nPositives: The ideas and style of research is nice. This is an important problem and I think this paper does a good job investigating this in the context of language modeling. I do hope the community (and I think the community is) moving towards being aware of these sorts of privacy issues.\n\nConcerns: I don't know how generalizable these results would be on really well-trained language models (rnn, convolution-based, or transformer-based). The related work section doesn't seem particularly well put together, so its difficult to place the work in appropriate context and gauge its impact.\n\nOther Thoughts: I'd like more thorough error analysis looking at exactly what kinds of strings/more nuanced properties of sequences that get a high differential score.\n\nOverall I think this work is interesting and I would encourage the authors to try and add as much quantitative evaluation as possible, but also try and include qualitative information regarding specific sequences after prodding the models. Those could go a long way in strengthening the paper."}
