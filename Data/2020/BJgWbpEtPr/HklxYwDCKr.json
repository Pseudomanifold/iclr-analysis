Argue that modeling it as a 2-way with a random negative sample is not efficient. Propose a novel technique applicable for prototypical networks. Their proposal is to use 0 as the prototype of null class. So the distance to the prototype is compared against the norm of the query embedding. They also propose modeling the distribution and not just the centroid using a multivariate gaussian. But in practice there is no benefit in doing so. Therefore, the main contribution is proposing to compare against norm of the embedding rather than a prototype for random negative samples. The benefit of this proposal decreases by more shots. Probably because the prototype of 20 random images is 0 anyway.\n\nFig. 4b is wrong. The 2-way results match the matching result in Fig. 3b rather than the prototypical result. \n\nConsidering Fig. 4 seems the most gain comes from the reordering rather than one-way proposal. So a natural question is what is the effect of reordering on the 2-way prototypical. It may boost the 2-way one too.\n\nThe contribution of this paper is intuitive and interesting. But given the experiments it seems insignificant. Specially with the missing reordering of the 2-way model results."}
