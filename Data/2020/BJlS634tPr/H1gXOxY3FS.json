This extension addresses one of the shortcoming of DARTS: the immense memory cost. This achieved in a simple way. Instead of using all channels only a random subset is used. To account for that, the authors propose a method to normalizes edges.\n\nThe description of the method is very clear. The related work covers many works. I suggest to focus more on the more recent work on NAS and particular work that follows the core idea of DARTS. This deserves more than used two very short sentences since this is the most related work. The experimental section leaves no question unanswered. The setup is clearly described in all cases, ablation studies are conducted wherever it is needed. The method is evaluated on both CIFAR-10 and ImageNet and is even transferred to MS COCO. The search results show some improvements with respect to time budget.\nConcluding, this might not be a ground-breaking paper but it is well made and I see no obvious flaws so I do not see any reason to reject it."}
