Specifically, the authors focus on predicting the missing link in a quadruple, i.e., (subject, predicate, ?, timestamp). In particular, the authors design a new tensor (order 4) factorization based method with proper regularization terms shown in Eqs.(4-6).\n\nThe authors also prepare a dataset which may be helpful for further study on this topic, which is highly appreciated.\n\nEmpirical studies on three public datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed model over the state-of-the-art tensor factorization based methods that are published very recently.\n\n\nSome comments:\n\n1 The technical novelty is a bit limited in compared with those 3-order tensor factorization based methods.\n\n2 For the time-aware link prediction problem, some deep learning based methods may also perform well, especially those capturing sequential signals, e.g., RNN and their variants. The authors are encouraged to include those works in the related work and in the empirical studies.\n\nMinor:\n\nTypo: 'ICEWS05-15'\n"}
