Besides, based on the assumption that these timestamp representations evolve slowly over time, the paper introduces this prior as a regularizer. Also, the paper adds a non-temporal component to the model to deal with static facts in knowledge bases. The proposed model has been evaluated using the current benchmark temporal event datasets, showing state-of-the-art performance.\nThis paper could be weakly accepted because the paper introduces new regularization schemes based on the tensor nuclear norm for tensor decomposition over temporal knowledge graphs, which could be a significant algorithmic contribution. Additionally, the submission empirically studies the impact of regularizations for the proposed model, and weight different regularizers according to the joint marginal of timestamps and predicates, which achieves good experimental results.\nFeedback to improve the paper:\n1. For novelty, the paper does not clearly point out that Ma et al. (2018) already augmented the ComplEx model with time embedding for completing temporal knowledge graphs.\n2. The paper does not point out whether the units of the timestamps affects the model and how to adjust the model accordingly. For example, the time granularity of the ICEWS dataset is 24 hours. If we switch the unit of timestamps from hours to days, do the results of the proposed model change? If yes, how to peak the best time unit for a given dataset?\n3. For the Wikidata, the author reports the filtered Mean Reciprocal Rank of the conducted experiments, where the author provides not only the overall score but also the temporal MRR. However, the paper does not provide information about error bars as well as the unfiltered version of the experiment results. Since the results of TComplEx and TNTComplEx are only slightly better than ComplexE, the reviewer doubts whether the proposed model can really beat the ComplEx model when considering the error bars. Also, NT-MRR and T-MRR are not clearly defined.\n4. The submission proposes a new large-scale temporal event dataset, and states that this dataset is more realistic than the current benchmarks. However, the reviewer does not find any argument in the paper to support this statement.\nReferences:\nThe\u0301o Trouillon, Johannes Welbl, Sebastian Riedel, E\u0301ric Gaussier, and Guillaume Bouchard.
