The approach relies on delayed updates to tolerate latencies and temporally sparse updates to reduce traffic. The approach is implemented in a synchronous stochastic gradient decent (SGD) scheme. \n\nThe paper's approach with delayed updates, i.e., delaying gradient updates to other nodes, sends the updates in a later iteration. In this way, very long latencies can be hidden (covered by computation) since the gradient updates can be postponed to an arbitrary iteration (barrier synchronization) in the future. \n\nUnfortunately, delaying the updates opens up for the same problems as asynchronous SGD (ASGD), i.e., slower (none) convergence or staleness problems. These problems are coped with using a compensation factor, that adjusts the momentum and weights accordingly. \n\nA critical aspect of ASGD is to provide convergence guarantees, and DTS is similar in that aspect. However, the paper does not provide any convergence analysis or convergence guarantees. \n\nUsing only one dataset / network to evaluate the approach is too little. In order to show the generality, more benchmarks need to be evaluated.\n\nIn general, I like the paper. It is well written and easy to read. However, the novelty and contribution is relatively low. A lot of work has been done in the HPC and distributed systems communities over decades on how to tolerate latencies, trade-offs between communication and computation, proper synchronization points, etc. The ideas presented in this paper are well-known and extensively applied in those communities. None of that work is referensed or acknowledged in this paper. \n\nThe term \"scalability\" is used as an evaluation metric, but never clearly defined in the paper.\n"}
