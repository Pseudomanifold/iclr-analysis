The authors use a bidirectional LSTM RNN further emphasising that memory of the DNA states contributes to chromatin folding structures.\n\nThe paper offers for a good read. \n\nBelow are comments for improvement and clarification.\n\na) There is only one equation in the paper and this is also not given clearly. What is the K being summed over? \n\nb) wMSE is an old concept and depending on the objective function, the equation can vary. Therefore, change the sentence to read that the authors have a \u2018modified' wMSE instead. \n\nc) Section 3.2, Page 3 last line: what is [5]?\n\nd) Section 4.3: 3rd paragraph, last line. Consider formalising the sentence, it will make it more readable. \n\ne) Figure 5: Right panel (top and bottom): correct the x-axis label\n\nf) There is no discussion explaining why regression is better or worse than a neural network, in this application setting. \n\ng) Figure 6 and associated experiment is very interesting and important. The authors should elaborate why, in certain cases, there were huge negative errors in training whereas the test error was positive."}
