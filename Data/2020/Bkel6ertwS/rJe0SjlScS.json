The authors show that LSTM out performs other methods. They attribute this to the memory of sequential DNA and LSTM model structure. They also propose a weighted mean squared error that improves the performance of the proposed model.\n\nThe authors compare the LSTM model with other classical approaches showing better performance based on predictive and quality metrics, applied to Hi-C data for drosophila, for predicting TADs.\n\nMy major concern is that it is not clear if the improvement is a by-product of LSTM without the proposed new metric. A fair comparison would also consider similar loss function designs for other approaches or at least comparing to a vanilla LSTM model. \n\nAlso the approach lacks illustration of generalizability. The definition of the loss function is also very specific (why 11?) and I wonder if this is generalizable to other Hi-C datasets or predictions based on other epigenetic features beyond ChIP-seq, e.g. ATAC-seq. \n"}
