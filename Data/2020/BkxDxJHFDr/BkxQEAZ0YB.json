This work is mainly motivated by the paper (Graph powering and spectral robustness, Abbe et al., 2018). The authors introduce the graph powering to graph convolution neural network domain to replace the original Laplacian operator. They further propose a graph sparsification/pruning strategy on the powered adjacency matrices in order to reduce the complexity and increase the robustness against adversarial attacks. They also provide theoretical analysis to prove that the proposed powering operator and subsequent methods have some spectral properties and theoretical feasibility. However, some conclusions are limited to the ideal situations or seem subjective. Extensive experiments are conducted to show better or comparable performance in both benign and adversarial situations. \n\nThere are some concerns that need to be addressed or clarified:\nA major concern is that the theoretical analyses in this paper are limited to graphs sampled from the SBM model. It is unclear how these analyses can be generalized to real graphs. Furthermore, the theorem 3 and proposition 5 are even limited to SBM model with 2 communities, which makes the analyses less convincing. \n\nSome of the arguments in the paper might be imprecise. For example, in Section 1.1, when discuss \u201cwhy not graph Laplacian?\u201d, a small spatial scope is claimed to be problematic. Although, it is correct for the GCN (Kipf & Welling, 2017), the powered Laplacian (mentioned earlier in the same section) does have a broad spatial scope.      \n\nIt would be better if the authors could provide more details about the sparsification. Specifically, how to choose the threshold (adaptively). \n\nIn the performance part of Section 4.2, the improvement of the performance by replacing Laplacian with VPN is marginal (compared with the original GCN). Furthermore, the performance of VPN is close to or sometimes worse than the baseline RGCN. \n\nSuggestions:\nIn the Informative and robust low-frequency spectral signal part of Section 4.3, it would be better if the authors can clarify the experiments setting. Is it using the low-frequency part (first few eigenvectors) to recover the signal and then using the recovered signal to perform the classification task? The titles of Figure 7 and Figure 8 are a little bit confusing. \n\n\nSome minor problems:\nThere are many typos such as: \u201cwith the presence of absence of edges\u201d, \u201cnormalizating\u201d, \u201casymptotoic\u201d, \u201cbenigh\u201d, \u201cajdacency\u201d, \u201csensitve\u201d, \u201cadajacent\u201d, \u201cone of the network\u201d, etc."}
