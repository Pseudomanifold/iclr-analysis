It discusses a very complex question (\"Are we learning in a kernel regime, or in a rich regime where features are identified\") by looking at perhaps the simplest model the authors could think of, and then study in detail the model. And how simple it turns out to be: just a linear regression with a twist. All in all, the paper is indeed is a clear demonstration that the differences between\"Kernel\" regime and one where some actual Learning is done can be demonstrated on simple examples. It is also the simplest model where one can observe  a non-trivial inductive bias and 'implicit regularisation'\n\nI do not have much to say on the paper, except that I fully support publication. \n\n\n\n"}
