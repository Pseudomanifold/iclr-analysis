Authors proposed to extend LDA as a discrimination evaluator for graph filleters. Also authors proposed Adaptive Filter Graph Neural Network to find the optimal filter within a limited family of graph convolutional filters. The whole study is novel, and beneficial for the community of graph neural network study. It provides a new way to understand and evaluate GNN.\n\nThere are some questions authors should clarify. And some writing errors to correct.\nEq (3) defines GFD for a pair of classes i and j. For a graph with more than two classes, the GFD will be the average of all pairs?
