Unlike previous research that is either proposing a new architecture or proposing expensive handcrafted features, this work proposes a model-agnostic learnable time embedding.\n\nI would like to recommend an accept based on the following reasons:\n* Modeling time is crucial for quite a few machine learning tasks. With the two most desired properties, learnable and model-agnostic, this time embedding will be very useful in various applications.\n* The authors are good at story-telling and this makes the paper very readable and approachable. This increases the chance of the contribution made in this paper to be applied in real-world applications.\n* This work did clear and detailed analysis on both the empirical results and the probing experiments.\n\n\n "}
