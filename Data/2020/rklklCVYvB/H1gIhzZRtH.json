The idea is to apply multiple sine functions to the time with trainable period and offset and concatenate them together, which is similar to positional encoding [Vaswani et al.] except that the periods and offsets are learned. The results on several sequential modelling datasets show that Time2Vec performs better than naive representations and alternative baselines. \n\n# Originality\n- Although the proposed representation looks simple and similar to positional encoding [Vaswani et al.], the idea of parameterizing sine functions is novel and interesting.\n\n# Quality\n- The proposed idea is very simple but seems very effective in practice as shown by the empirical results. \n- The paper also provides in-depth analysis and ablation studies showing that each of the proposed component is helpful. \n- Although the results presented in this paper look very promising, it would be much stronger if the paper presented results on other sequential modelling tasks such as machine translation and language modelling that the research community cares about much more. For example, it would be great if the paper showed that replacing the fixed positional encoding with Time2Vec improves the performance on a machine translation dataset.\n- It would be good to show the effect of the number of sine units (k) in Time2Vec. \n- (Minor) Clockwork RNN [Koutn\u00b4\u0131k et al.] introduces a nice toy periodic sequential prediction problem, where the model has to recover a mixture of sine/cosine function. It looks like a natural task to show in this paper as well (which can potentially replace the synthesized data experiment). \n\n# Clarity\n- The paper is overall well-written.\n- Figure 4 is not mentioned in the main text.\n- Figure 5 is mentioned earlier than Figure 3. It would be good to swap them. \n\n# Significance\n- This paper proposes a simple but effective idea that can be potentially widely used by the research community. The paper would be stronger if it included more results on high-impact sequential modelling tasks and datasets such as machine translation. "}
