In this algorithm, the authors show a rigorous probabilistic interpretation under the maximum likelihood principle. This algorithm has a stable and efficient training process. The authors provided a lots of theoretical and experimental analysis to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Therefore, the innovation of this paper is very novel. The theoretical analysis is sufficient, and the technology is sound. "}
