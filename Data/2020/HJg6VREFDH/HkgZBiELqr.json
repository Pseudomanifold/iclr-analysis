The paper contains several interesting ideas and theoretical results. The proposed method is also demonstrated to perform reasonable in benchmark examples. One particularly nice property is that the authors derive a duality gap that can be used as a stopping criterion. \n\nMy main concern with the paper is that I don\u2019t think it is sufficiently well written. In particular, the motivations for IWGAN presented in section 2 are both technically involved and vague. For instance, the optimisation problem is introduced with the sentence \u201cThe primal and dual formulations motivate us to define the iWGAN objective to be\u201d, which does not motivate what we might benefit from using the objective. I generally feel that the presented arguments in favour of IWGAN are not sufficiently clear and convincing. Unfortunately, I also have similar concerns with later sections. In fact, even though the authors argue that the simulation results are also better than state of the art algorithms, my impression is that recent GAN modules often generate images which are even more realistic than this. \n\nIn spite of my concerns, I find the presented theory interesting and with better motivations and examples, it may eventually become a solid and well-cited contribution.
