The idea of using keypoints to carry pose estimation is is more than 15 years old, and for the car examples reported in this paper, I'm wondering why not just you SURF or SIFT - these would certainly have been reasonable baselines. The convnets cited in this paper are mostly targeted at the harder problem of estimating human body poses.\n\nThe paper is very hard to read. It is full of typos and far from ready for submission to ICLR. The equations (eg eqn 1) are impossible to parse.\n\nBased on all this I find it hard to trust the results. \n\n"}
