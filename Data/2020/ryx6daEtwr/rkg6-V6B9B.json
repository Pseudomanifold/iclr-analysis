The idea is appealing, especially the use of domain knowledge combined with a data driven method to improve a model-based task.\n\n The authors propose a set of model configurations on the waypoint detection, optimization techniques, a deep learning network topology and a data driven and domain knowledge based wheel detection mechanism.\n\nImprovements on vehicle identification and tracking are not shown in the study, but different computer vision methods  are compared to each other.\n\nThe study has several shortcomings in consistently stating the problem and the result, completeness, reproducibility, quantification of results and the experimental methodology lacks  a systematic approach to isolate the effects of the different components of the proposed method.\n\nIt seems that the full method proposed yields better results compared to other way point based methods in a certain phase space. However, from the material shown, especially the lack of the experimental description and its systematic shortcomings,  I cannot judge if the components of the method can contribute to improved vehicle detection and tracking.\n\nThe paper can be strengthened by the following:\n    Better framing of the problem\n    Improve the descriptions on the experiments carried out\n    Including a quantitative discussion on the results and the corresponding uncertainties\n    Systematic studies on the behavior of the proposed method components including a mathematical description in the probability space\n\n \n\nMore detailed comments:\n\nBetter framing of the problem:\n\n    The framing of the problem and the task lack  at least a qualitative discussion on the issues arising in using visual based vs Lidar/Radar. I disagree with the authors, that a visual system can replace these other systems, but rather enhance results under certain conditions. I am missing the discussion on the shortcomings of camera sensors with regards to the overall task: Day/Night, Fog, wheels are not visible from all angles and the impact on the target phase space. The authors give an outline, that there is a study to come tackling the performance on vehicle identification, therefore a qualitative discussion could be enough at this point.\n\nImprove the descriptions on the experiments carried out\n    So that someone else can reproduce it\n\nSystematic studies on the behavior of the proposed method components including a mathematical description in the probability space\n\n    The Experiment is not described at all and is therefore not reproducible. The results shown are in general the overall Precision and Recall on some dataset. The authors state at several occasions, that isolated measures on the method show better performance. E.g. the choice of the \"..online hard keypoints mining method..\", \"..the fixed range of softmax inputs..\", \"..ensure the accuracy io vehicle yaw angle\u2026\". However, I cannot find proof of these statements in the material shown. Usually only the overall task performance is stated from which deductions on isolated effects cannot be drawn.\n    Albeit mentioning in the introduction priors in a Gaussian Process framework, I have not noticed a notion of a random variable, a probability density distribution or the impact of the experiment on the prior pdfs.  A systematic study on the behavior of those pdfs is missing and only a few example picture of bounding boxes are shown.\n\nIncluding a quantitative discussion on the results and the corresponding uncertainties\n    Insert a quantitative  discussion on the experiments.  Insert estimates on uncertainties on the results or give at least a qualitative statement, if these are negligible.\n\nOther: The paper is an application paper and does not offer novel advances for the ICLR community.\n"}
