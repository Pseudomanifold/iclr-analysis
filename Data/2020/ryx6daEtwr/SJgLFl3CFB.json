The method imposes several handcrafted constraints specific to the dataset in order to achieve higher improvement and efficiency. These constraints are quite strong and they not generalize to new situations (eg. a car in the sky, a car upside down a car with multiple wheels). The results do not seem particularly strong because the dataset seems easy and the improvements over previous works is small. \n\nI would suggest to emphasise the improvements over previous works and send this paper to a specialized journal or venue in vehicle detection.
