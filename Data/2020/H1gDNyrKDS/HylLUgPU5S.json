The paper finds that DARTS models do not generalize due to sharp minima, partially caused by the discretizing step in DARTS. The paper presents many experiments and studies on multiple search spaces, showing that this problem is general. To address this problem, the paper proposes several different ways to address this, e.g., an early stopping criteria and regularization methods.\n\nOverall, the paper is well written, thorough experiments (various tasks and search spaces) show the benefit of the approach.  The final experiments using the full DARTS space also show an improvement over standard DARTS.\n\nThe final method is fairly simple, running the search with different regularization parameters and keeping the best model, which suggests it could be widely used for DARTS-based approaches. \n\n Two (very) minor comments:\n- There's a missing space before \"Similarly\" in section 2.1\n- Extra \")\" in last paragraph of section 2.2 (after the argmin eq)."}
