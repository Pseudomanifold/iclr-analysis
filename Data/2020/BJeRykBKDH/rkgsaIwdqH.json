The paper shows good results in DDI prediction, although the performance gap with previous works (Zitnik et al., 2018) is modest.\n\nIn the related work they mention some works from Graph Neural Networks literature. But works from the benchmark experiments are not explained. I think they could also explain which are the similarities and differences of the proposed method vs these works they are comparing to.\n\nAnother way of improving the paper could be running more experiments beyond the QM9 dataset to corroborate the good performance of the algorithm.\n\nIn equation (2), a message that goes from node \u201cj\u201d to node \u201ci\u201d does not include node \u201ci\u201d as input into the edge operation. I think the GNN would be more powerful if both nodes \"i\" and \"j\" are input into the edge operation.\n\nIn summary, the main contribution of the paper is to add attention connections between two graphs. I do not feel it is innovative enough.\n"}
