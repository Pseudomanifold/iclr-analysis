Feeding graphs pairwisely into the model allows nodes to easily exchange information with nodes in other graphs as well as within the graph. This method outperforms other previous ones on a pairwise graph classification task (drug-drug interaction prediction).\nThis model is generalized from Neural Message Passing for Quantum Chemistry (Justin Gilmer et al.) and Graph Attention Networks (Petar Velickovic et al.), but most ideas are directly from the two previous papers. Combining the two methods do provide insights into understanding the interactions between graphs and get really good results on DDI prediction, but the novelty is limited.\nQuestions:\n1 Are atoms encoded as only atom numbers, charges and connected hydrogen atoms? Because some atoms might have much larger atom numbers than others, e.g. carbon (6) and sulfur (16), will there be some scale problems? Will one-hot encoding of atom type help (like in Neural Message Passing for Quantum Chemistry)?\n2 According to the paper, bond types will be encoded as e_{ij}. But in molecules, bond type is way more complex than only single/double/triple bonds, especially for drug molecules which are enriched for aromatic systems. For example, bonds in benzene or pyridine rings are between single and double (also not necessarily 3/2). Are there other possible methods to encode graph edges?\n3 In result table 2 of Section 4 (quantum chemistry), I didn\u2019t see a principle of choosing K value and choosing neighbors because different properties reaches the lowest MAE at different K values. This might cause some confusion in real application. Moreover, the authors should compare the performance with previous methods.\n"}
