The motivation is good with limited technical novelty. The paper is well-written and well organized.\n\n\nFor MHCADDI, it is performing binary classification for all side effect labels. It is different from Decagon\u2019s setting, hence not comparable. Maybe also include Decagon-Binary?\n\n\nMissing baseline: as its main innovation is using co-attention, it should compare with concatenated embedding generated from Graph Attention Network so that we know co-attention is better than independent attention on each drug (seems the authors have already attempted to do so but did not report it). Current baselines such as Decagon only use GCN with no attention mechanism. It could be also benefited by including VGAE. "}
