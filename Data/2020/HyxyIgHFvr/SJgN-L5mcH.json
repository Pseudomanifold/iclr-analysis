The paper attempts to answer the following theoretical assumptions: the existence of local minima in loss landscapes, the relevance of weight decay with small L2-norm solutions, the connection between deep neural networks to kernel-based learning theory, and the generalization ability of networks with low-rank layers.\n\nWe think that this work is timely and of significant interest, since theoretical work on deep learning has made significant progress in recent years.\n\nSince this paper seeks to provide an empirical study on the assumptions in deep learning theory, we think that the results are somehow weak as the paper is missing extensive analysis, using several well-known datasets and several deep architectures and settings. For example, only the CIFAR-10 dataset is considered in the paper, and it is not clear whether the obtained results will generalize to other datasets. This also goes to the neural network architecture, as only MLP is considered to answer the assumption about the existence of suboptimal minima, while only ResNet is considered to study the generalization abilities with low-rank layers. We think that this is not enough for a paper that tries to provide an empirical study."}
