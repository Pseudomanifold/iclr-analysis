Given a graph, it leverages a variational autoencoder to embed the distance between two atoms into latent vectors (encoder) and then generate distance between two atoms based on the latent vector. Even if the problem is well motivated, I have several concerns:\nI. What is the variable \"x\"? Is it possible to define a bit formally? It appears that x=(G,d) i.e. the graph with d.\nII. It would be nice to develop the generative model of (G,d) i.e. both G and d. Simply generating d looks a bit restrictive. \nIII. How do you model/learn \\mathcal{O}(x)?\n\nI would be curious to know the answer of these questions."}
