For this, the notion of a concurrent action is introduced.\n\nThe paper focuses on value-based RL approaches. It introduces modifications to the classical MDP formulation such that concurrent actions can be handled. From a theoretical perspective the resulting Bellman operators (for both continuous and discrete time) remain contractions and thus maintain q-learning convergence guarantees. Qlearning models are adopted to support concurrent actions and the experiments  demonstrate that the suggested enhancements are working well."}
