Specifically, the authors introduce (1) encoder: producing a complex-valued feature, (2) processing module:  extracting useful features for a decoder and (3) decoder: making a final decision from processed features. Using various deep architectures and datasets, the authors showed that the proposed method can hide the input data from hidden features while maintaining the performance of DNNs.\n\nDetailed comments:\n\nThe research topic and main idea of this paper (i.e. introducing a complex-valued neural network for hiding sensitive input data) are interesting and the authors showed that the proposed idea indeed works well using various neural architectures and datasets. It would be more interesting if the authors can consider NLP datasets or other tasks instead of classification. Overall, the paper is well-written and the ideas are novel. "}
