The problem is important and interesting. The proposed framework has solid theory and is well conceived. A generic method is proposed with O(1/T) convergence rate, which is also empirically demonstrated with good performance on often-used MNIST and CIFAR-10 benchmarks. An alternating multi-step PGD is also proposed. Empirical experiments are thorough and well organized. Overall I feel it is a well written paper with sufficient contributions and is of interest to a range of ICLR audience.\n"}
