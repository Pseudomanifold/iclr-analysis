Specifically, the authors study adversarial attacks against model ensembles, universal perturbations, and attacks constrained by the union of Lp norms. They propose optimizing a probability distribution over \"domains\" (models in an ensemble, inputs, Lp balls; respectively per task) and regularizing it to be close to uniform. They perform experiments to evaluate their method.\n\nFrom a conceptual point of view, I did not find the contribution of the paper significant. All of the tasks discussed are direct application of the min-max framework and have been studied to a certain extent in prior work (https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.11304, https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04701, https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.13000). The novel tools introduced are the regularizer on simplex probability and the attack diversity regularizer. However, the theoretical justification for these tools is rather weak and their utility would need to be demonstrated empirically.\n\nFrom an experimental point of view, the baselines considered are very weak. At a high level, the authors compare their version of min-max optimization to a very simple average-case optimization. In order to demonstrate the utility of the tools introduced the authors would need to at least compare to a reasonable min-max baseline. For instance, a very simple heuristic capping the loss of each domain in the finite-sum formulation (https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.11304) would be the bare minimum. In their current state, the experiments only demonstrate that a min-max approach outperforms an average case approach, which is fully expected. At the same time, the diversity regularizer does seem to offer some empirical gains and I would encourage the authors to investigate further.\n\nOverall, the conceptual and experimental contributions of the paper are rather weak and I thus recommend rejection."}
