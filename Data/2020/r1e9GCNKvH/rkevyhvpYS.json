I feel therefore that I can only provide a very superficial feedback.\n\nThe authors generalize recently-developed network pruning techniques that were developed in he context of feed-forward networks, and do not require iterative pruning-retraining cycles, to RNNs. Since RNNs apply the same matrix on their hidden vector multiple times, approximate closed-form expressions for pruning criteria can be derived analytically. The pruning criterion is based on the spectrum of the Jacobian matrix of the (N+1)-th hidden unit with respect to the N-th one. A closed-form algorithm for pruning is presented, and the method is evaluated on several datasets.\n\nWhile I appreciate the neatness of deriving closed-form analytical expressions for a fast and simple pruning method, I feel that am not in a position to rate the paper. My apologies to the Authors and the Editors."}
