The authors consistently observe strong mode collapse on several state-of-the-art GANs using the proposed toolset. The authors analyze possible causes, and for the first time present two simple yet effective \u201cblack-box\u201d methods to calibrate the GAN learned distribution, without accessing either model parameters or the original training data.\n\nThe writing and presentation are good.\n\nMy concerns regarding this paper are as below.\n1) I wonder if the proposed method work for most GAN models, more experiments evaluated on more recent GAN-based  models should be added to verify the superiority claimed in this paper, e.g., TP-GAN [Huang et al., ICCV 2017], PIM [Zhao et al., CVPR 2018], DR-GAN [Tran et al., CVPR 2017], DA-GAN [Zhao et al., NIPS 2017], MH-Parser [Li et al., 2017], 3D-PIM [Zhao et al., IJCAI 2018], SimGAN [Shrivastava et al., CVPR 2016], AIM [Zhao et al., AAAI 2019].\n2) The main contributions of this paper are not quite clear to me.\n3) Typos need to be corrected in next version, e.g., all equations should have punctuation mark at the end, all e.g., i.e., et al., etc. should be italic, format of references should be consistent.\n\nBased on my comments above, I decide to give the rate of WA for this paper.", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I carefully checked the derivations and theory."}
