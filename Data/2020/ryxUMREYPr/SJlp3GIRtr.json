Rather than using the labels, the authors use an off-the-shelf model (on faces) to provide a space on which to measure distances between generated images. They use this distance to test the hypothesis that samples are highly concentrated around some modes, thus under representing others.\n\nThe paper could benefit from more clarity. For instance, the methods would be better illustrated through some toy figures. In addition, some explanations in this work are very hard to parse, e.g., the first paragraph of the methods section.\n\nWhile this work is focusing on black box methods for evaluating and palliating mode dropping (aka collapse), it's a bit disappointing that these results are at least also evaluating on white-box type methods in settings where mode dropping is clearer, e.g. PACGAN on stacked MNIST or even normal CelebA. Unfortunately, no white-box methods are covered in this work, so there is no strong point of comparison, which would be helpful to establish the validity of this work.\n\nFinally, the authors demonstrated that there exist a high-density mode, but not whether some modes might be missing. How can this method be used to find missing modes if the generator isn't generating them without the real data? If my generator is only generating a few digits, but each of them represented similarly by the generated distribution, what would this measure do? It wont detect that the generator is missing modes: you'd need to know those modes existed (e.g., have examples of them).\n\nGenerally I like the experiments, though I wish there were more qualitative results looking at more than just the existence of one worst-case mode.\n\nOther comments\npage 1\nI'm not sure the connection between mode collapse and instability is well-established. What motivates connecting to instability in this work?\nThe statement about co-variate shift is a little vague, and it's not clear what the connection to mode collapse is.\npage 2\nI'm surprised PACGAN isn't mentioned in the white-box methods. It was one of the big SOTA methods for palliating mode dropping.\nI'm not sure why ignore white-box methods: at least it would be good verification that this method works (e.g., across methods, common measures of collapse used in those settings, etc)\npage 3\nThe first paragraph of Section 3 is very difficult to understand.\nf is normalized?\npage 4\nWhy not use Ripley's K?

The problem is that this measure wont detect mode dropping if there's aren't samples from those modes to measure anything against. You need real samples as well.\nHow were these face models chosen? Why not use the discriminator of the GAN (at least test what it does)? How were these hyper parameters chosen?\npage 7:\n5.1.2 could use an accompanying toy figure demonstrating what's going on.\n"}
