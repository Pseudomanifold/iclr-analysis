The adapt a well known U-Net architecture to the task by introducing a complex-valued FiLM layer and a new complex similarity loss that explicitly takes magnitude and phase into account. They motivate the use of complex values well and demonstrate performance and parameter efficiency improvements over real-valued baselines. Importantly, they do not need to perform spetrogram inversion because their network works natively in the complex domain. Despite the quantitative improvements over spectral models, they still slightly underperform the ConvTasNet baseline that operates directly in the waveform domain (which was slightly misleading to not include in the table). The authors perform an extensive hyperparameter search to tune the model and provide sufficient detail to reproduce their experiments. While the results did not improve upon the best baseline, they do provide further evidence to the value of using complex-valued neural networks to handle complex-valued data (where phase and synchronicity matter), which I believe will be of value to the ICLR community, and thus I lean slightly in favor of acceptance.
