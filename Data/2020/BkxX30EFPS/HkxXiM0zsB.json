Training procedures for the same based on MLE and VAE are presented as well.\n\nThe idea is quite interesting but there are certain problems in clarity regarding the loss terms and the precise need for them. It appears that the work is proposing a novel framework for training VAEs where instead of comparing the target and generated distribution in the data space (the standard $L_r$), the loss is minimised by minimizing the divergence between these distributions after mapping them onto a latent space. To achieve this objective the author\u2019s design two loss terms in addition to the standard reconstruction error. Authors provided two approaches for their training method based on MLE and VAE. Their framework is then experimentally evaluated on the standard dataset and demonstrate superior results; better-generated images and lower FID score) and provide ablation results.\n\n\nThe explanation of the Equation 2 is confusing, where the Figure-1a and the equation seem to agree but the subsequent description says that $h(.)$ should map ${N}(0, I)$ to $\\hat{H}$ but Equation-2 will bring $h(z)$ closer to ${N}(0, I)$. Is there something missing here? The notation and the derivation of the MLE approach in Section 3.3 are not clear. This section would need rewriting with clearer and compact notation for better readability. The main idea is quite clear but how this training procedure achieves that is not coming out clearly in this version. Thus I feel the paper, though has good content, is not publishable in the current format.\n", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I assessed the sensibility of the derivations and theory."}
