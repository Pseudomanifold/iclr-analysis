The neural network is being used to predict the next steps in the search procedure, in this case, assignment to literals of the 2-QBF formula. Justifiably, a reinforcement learning formulation is used. I thought that the paper was very impressive. All necessary concepts were clearly introduced, the claims were very clear and thoroughly validated. Limitations of the current approach are also properly discussed. \n\nOnly comment I have is that using shallow networks with one iteration sounds not enough for a problem like 2-QBF solving. I noticed that you have this exploration in the appendix, would recommend moving it to the main paper. I would also have liked 2-QBF to be mentioned more explicitly in the abstract and early introduction.\n\nMinor errors:\n\"and\" --> \"an\" in Sec 1\n\"variale\" --> \"variable\" in Sec 4.2\nReference ? in Sec 6 "}
