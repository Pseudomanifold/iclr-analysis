In this way of analysis, a large number of experiments are necessary. In addition to ensuring a large number of experiments, it is necessary to ensure the diversity of methods. This article only studied MAML, therefore, the conclusion of the experimental inquiry cannot convince me.\nFor the experimental part, I am afraid the results are also weak. For example, please notice that many meta-learning models have proposed. I believe authors should compare more existing works to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed one.\n"}
