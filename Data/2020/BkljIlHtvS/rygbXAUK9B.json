The results suggest that modeling and adaptation are happening on different parts of the network leading to an inefficient use of the model capacity which explains the poor performance of MAML on linear (or small networks) models. To tackle this issue they proposed a kronecker factorization of the meta optimizer.\n\nThe paper is well motivated and well written in terms of clarity in the message and being easy to follow.\n\nOne major issue is that the experimental study is not that comprehensive to support the claim of the paper. Especially, in analyzing the failure case of linear models.For example, one may try small (but nonlinear networks) and compare its performance with larger (possibly overparameterized) ones on at least 2 standard network architectures. But, it doesn't mean that I don't like the paper at its current state. The paper yet has a message and it's delivered clearly.\n\nI wonder if the overparameterized is just related to depth or overparameterization in width would work too? If not then it might be the \"nonlinearity\" that is doing the work\n\nIn section 3.2 (Figure 2, left) and (Figure2, mid) show that FC follows the pattern of C1-C3. t\nThen the authors proposed the experiment related to perturbing FC (Figure 2, right) to show that FC is actually not similar to C1-C3 and is important to adaptation. However, one can do similar experiments for C1-C3 and claim they are also important to adaptation. It seems that FC and C4 are really different.\n\nFor a non-expert reader it's not readily clear that how the kronecker factorization of A leads to equation 5. An explanation can help. Also, a few sentences or schematic demonstration of kronecker product makes the paper self-contained. \n\nThere are a few typos in the paper that can be removed after a thorough proofreading.\u00a0"}
