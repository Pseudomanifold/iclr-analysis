It contributes in two aspects: 1) a new edge embedding strategy and 2) Hungarian attention incorporating with the loss function. A set of experiments as well as ablation studies have been conducted to show the effectiveness of the method.\n\nHowever, my concerns are:\n1) Is the graph matching algorithms only applied in the field of image matching\uff1fHow about other fields\uff1f\n2) And if not, is it more convincing to conduct more experiments across other related fields?\n3) It will be better to give algorithm complexity and parameter analysis with the state-of-the-art algorithms since many additional operations are added."}
