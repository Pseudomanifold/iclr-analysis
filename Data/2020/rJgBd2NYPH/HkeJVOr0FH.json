Although I am familiar with the graph matching problem, I have much less experience regarding its application in vision. My understanding is that features are extracted from images and used to construct a graph. This graph is then passed through a GNN but there are steps which are unclear. In particular on page 5, 'm and H are fed to a GRU as a sequential input' but I do not see where this fit into the architecture. Similarly, I am a bit confused by equations (8) and (9) as there is a H^(t+1)_v in both equations. Does equation (9) make the function u_t explicit? Then what is \\Gamma_N and similarly what is \\Gamma_E in equation (11)?\nAs it is written, this paper seems more appropriate for a conference in vision. "}
