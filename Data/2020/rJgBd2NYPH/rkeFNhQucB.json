The overall framework of this paper is somehow similar to [1] and [2], except for the final Hungarian attention module, which is the key contribution of this paper. In the current settings, the authors proved that using their Hungarian attention module, the performance can be improved. However, it would be better if the Hungarian attention can be applied to DGCNN in [1] and CMPNN in [2]. It would be good if the author can do an extra experiment to apply the Hungarian attention module to these two modules. Also, the authors may want to add some discussion about these two papers in the related works section (both papers do have published their codes). \n\nIn the current experiment settings, both visual and geometric feature is used. Is it possible for the module to only using geometric features as [1] and [2]?\n\n\n[1] Wang, Yue, and Justin M.
