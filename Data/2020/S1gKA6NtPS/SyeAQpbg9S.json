The problem is new (to Deep RL) and interesting. My main concern is about the proposed method, where the three RL related equations (not numbered) at page 5 are also direct copy-from-textbook policy gradient equations without specific adaptation to the new application considered in this paper, which is very strange. The two conditional probability definitions considered at page 3 are not mentioned in later text. These are only fractions of the underlying method and by reading the paper back and forth several times, it is not clear of the basic algorithmic flowchart, let alone more detailed description of the related parameters. Without these information, it is impossible to have a fair judge of the novelty and feasibility of the proposed method. The empirical results are also limited in small dataset, which makes it hard to verify the generality of the superior claim.\n"}
