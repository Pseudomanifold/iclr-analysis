Under the core of the framework, DCTD adopts the Monte Carlo approximations to calculate the integral in the negative log-likelihood Eqn(2). The authors perform comprehensive experiments on four computer vision regression tasks. \n\nThe main concern about this paper is the novelty and the technological contributions. The Monte Carlo approximation is an off-the-shelf numeric integration method. The novelty of this paper is very limited."}
