The first step called the graph isomorphic layer compute features invariant to the order of nodes by extracting sub-graphs and cosidering all possible permutation of these subgraphs. There is no training involved here as no parameter is learned. Indeed the only learning part is in the so-called classification component which is a (standard) fully connected layer. In my opinion, any classification algorithm could be used on the features extracted from the graphs.\nExperiments are then given for the graph classification. I do not understand results of Table 1 as the accuracies reported for MUTAG and PTC in Xu et al with GIN are much higher than the numbers here."}
