Federated Learning is used whether they propose a particular split of model parameters with user embedding (private) and the overall BLSTM model (shared). Federated Averaging is used for the global update.\n\nThe key contribution of this paper is not clear. It seems to be the introduction of the notion of split-personalisation-constraint, and it shows that the modeling each user with a \u201cprivate\u201d embedding that feeds to a global MLP with a global BLSTM as another input (named as FURL) can achieve the constraint so that FL can be used. The originality is limited.\n"}
