Details, usually considered as implementation-level particularities, are shown to be of crucial importance for the algorithms' performance.\n\n# Decision\nThe paper makes an important point, it is written clearly, and the body of evidence is convincing. Therefore, I recommend this paper for publication.\n\n# Suggestions\nMake it more clear what is meant by code-level optimizations.\n    - In Sec. 2, there is a link to Appendix A.2 for a \"full list\", but the list in A.2 does not contain all points from Sec. 2.\n    - For PPO-M, it is said \"implements only the core of the algorithm\". What exactly does that mean?\n    - PPO-NoClip is defined as \"PPO without clipping\". Does it mean that it includes all other tricks apart from clipping? Please, be explicit in such places.\n"}
