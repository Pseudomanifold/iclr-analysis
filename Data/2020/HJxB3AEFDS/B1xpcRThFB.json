They define this problem as a binary classification problem: do 2 names refer to the same person. In this article, they propose to build a image page representation of the 2 strings to compare and to apply an image classifier. This approach is different to standard approaches that  either extract features from the pair (edit distance, cosine distance) and classify the pair or take the two stings as input (siamese networks). \n\nThe authors claim that the benefits of the method is to allow to use image classifiers, but one can argue than methods have been specifically design for text and that is is a disadvantage to discard them all.\n\nOne advantage of the proposed method is that it is independent from word ordering : this is correct , but how would it compare to a simple bag of ngrams ?\nThe proposed method could be interesting but the task does not allow to show in which case it could be of use : the model is tested on only one task for which the state of the art  is alread 99% F1. The authors should use another task or explain why a 0.3% improvement  is significant and important.\n\n\nData : give examples of the data from the different datasets. It is not clear if the 2 considered datasets are merged or separate.\n\nBlocking : is it exact match? what is the impact of the task : names that can not be identified anymore after this step?\n\n4.1 :  what happens if a letter occurs several times ?\n\n"}
