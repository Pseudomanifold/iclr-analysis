Moreover, when it is combined with some fast  training methods, such as cyclic learning rate scheduling and mixed precision, the adversarial training time can be significantly decreased. The experiment verifies the authors' claim convincingly.\nOverall, the paper provides a novel finding that could significantly change the adversarial training strategy. The paper is clearly written and easy to follow. I recommend the acceptance.\n"}
