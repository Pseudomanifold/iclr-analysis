This is somewhat surprising because previous works indicate that FGSM is not a powerful attack compared to iterative versions of it like projected gradient descent (PGD), and it has not been shown before that models trained on FGSM can defend against PGD attacks. Judging from the results in the paper alone, there are some issues with the experiment results that could be due to bugs or other unexplained experiment settings. \n\nThe most alarming part of the results is the catastrophic failure with larger step sizes 16/255 for CIFAR10 in Table 1. This is very strange because the method works well when using epsilon=10/255 to defend against an adversary with epsilon=8/255. \nThe authors explain this with overfitting, but this is not satisfactory. Suppose I want to use the method to defend against an adversary with power epsilon=14/255, then it is conceivable that I would use a slightly larger step size, say 16/255, as suggested by the authors.  The results in the table tells me that this method will fail completely, because it cannot defend against epsilon=8/255, let alone the target perturbation 14/255. The method is probably not failing completely, because it does have good accuracy on clean data and does learn something. So it cannot be due to the model not having enough capacity to learn against an epsilon=16/255 adversary. \n\nThe authors should check some potential issues with the experiments: \n1. Is there any label leakage in the FGSM training? \n2. The pseudo-code does not contain any projection onto the feasible set; the authors should check it. \n\nSince the claim of this paper is somewhat unexpected given previous works on defending against adversaries, the experiment results have to be very solid. With these issues with the experiments I don't believe the current paper is ready for publication yet. \n\n\n"}
