The method is based on determinantal point processes in the latent space and relies on specifying a kernel in the sample space and a quality metric in the latent space. \n\nIncreasing diversity of samples from VAE-like models is an important and common problem and the authors present a reasonably generic method for solving it. The experiments are sensible and show clear improvement over a reasonable selection of baselines. One improvement I would suggest is adding a more explicit discussion of how the proposed method avoids generating overly diverse, very improbable trajectories. It is also somewhat suspicious that the trajectories shown in Figure 3 are terminated so early."}
