The model is based on the probabilistic model and variational inference. To show the effectiveness of the proposed model, the authors do experiments on several benchmarks.\n\nThe model lacks enough technical novelty. The motivation of this paper is a task-specific weight adaptation mechanism, which seems a simple version of [1]. In addition, the design of b^T as s/(1+e^{-a^T})-1 is not well-motivated. It is better to explain more.\n\nIn addition, if the authors compare the performance on both negative transfer (forgetting) and forward transfer (performance on the new task). I suggest the authors compare with [2], which also focuses on the performance of new tasks.\n\nMinor:\n1.
