However, errors due to quantization affect different neural architectures differently. It would be useful if we could predict ahead of time which models are more amenable to quantization. I think this is a very interesting premise and the paper is very well motivated.\n\nThe paper is also very clear and well written, making the claims precise and backing these up with experiments.\n\nAt the heart of the paper is the replacement of floating point numbers with inexact values, which are treated as random variables and defined precisely in equation 4. This definition enables the authors to apply Monte Carlo methods to obtain network predictions as shown in equation (10) and figure 2, and subsequently carry out sensitivity analysis. The experiments show that a measure of sensitivity (K) is indeed a good augmentation to cross-validation for model selection for the purpose of trading-off accuracy and resource consumption when launching deep neural networks with floating point rounding errors.\n\nOne question I have for the authors is the following: There has been a large body of literature on Monte Carlo methods for Bayesian neural networks. Could those works have something to say in addressing some of the challenges posed in Section 4.1? \n"}
