In particular, the regularizer considers explanations during the model training; if the explanations are not consistent with some prior knowledge, then explanation errors will be introduced. \n\nThe motivation for the proposed research is interesting and has some merit. However, I am a bit worried that the proposed approach is somewhat ad hoc. I can imagine there are various explanations that can be generated for the same model. There can also be different prior knowledge available for a particular problems. Which prior knowledge and explanations to use seem to affect a lot about the learned model. But there is no principled approaches for making the selection.\n\nIn some sense, standard regularizers such as L1 or L2 are are intrinsic regularizers, while the proposed regularizer is extrinsic regularizer. I think the extrinsic regularizer certainly has some merit, but it is also hard to regulate.\n\nFor instance, consider the example in Figure 2 about the presence of patches. Isn't that a too specific knowledge about the dataset, which in turn makes the proposed approach not general? I have doubts on how useful a method is if it relies on such specific prior knowledge about the data."}
