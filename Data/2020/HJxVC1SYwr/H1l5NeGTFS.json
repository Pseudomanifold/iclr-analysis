In this paper, a new data-free method is proposed to create universal adversarial perturbation without using data. There are some similarities with GDUAP though, authors also make some crucial improvements. They perform Euclidean norm maximization before the non-linearity of each layer, which not only has theoretical backing but also brings better performance in practice. Meanwhile, they optimize the perturbations in each layer in a sequential manner instead of joint optimization to avoid chances of reaching local minima solutions.\n\nThe authors provide a detailed theoretical analysis and systematic experimental results to demonstrate their arguments, which is convincing. What\u2019s more, the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art data-free fooling rates on the large-scale dataset, which strongly demonstrates the effectiveness of their method.\n\nIn section 3.2, (the top of page 4) \u201cwhich becomes additive if column vectors in W1X are in the same orthant as W1p.
