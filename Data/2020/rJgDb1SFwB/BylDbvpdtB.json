The sepsis detection problem is of paramount importance in the clinical domain and the authors rightly emphasized that point. Also the paper tries to combine interpretability with prediction accuracy by using attention mechanism. \n\nThe paper is generally well written and well motivated; however, in terms of technical novelty and empirical evidence the paper can be further improved. \n\nThe MGP-AttnTCN model is mostly a minor modification of the model proposed by Moor et al. 2019 and has the additional attention element to be more interpretable. Unfortunately, it\u2019s not easy for an ICLR reader without any medical background to evaluate the validity of the interpretability results provided in the paper. Furthermore, the recent works in NLP have agued against the value of attention for interpretability (see for instance \u201cAttention is not Explanation\u201d by Jain & Wallace 2019). That said, I believe the paper is probably a better fit for a machine learning in healthcare venue (such as MLHC). \n\nIn terms of empirical evidence of the prediction accuracy the paper only compares with Moor et al 2019 (which does not show a significant improvement in the realistic setting) and a much older InSight paper (2016). This would have been typically enough for a paper with major technical novelty; however, for this paper, I believe adding more recent baselines and discussing the advantages of the method over these baselines would be necessary. \n\nMinor:\nCaption in Figure 1 can be more informative and useful for the reader if you add more details on different parts of the model. \n\u201cGraphically, once can observe\u201d should be \u201cone can observe\u201d .
