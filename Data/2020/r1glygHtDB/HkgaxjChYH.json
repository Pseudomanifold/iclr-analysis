Lazy labels are defined as coarse labels of the segmented objects. The proposed method is a UNET trained in a multitask fashion whit 3 tasks: object detection, object separation, and object segmentation. The method is trained on 2 datasets: air bubbles, and ice crystals. The proposed method performs better than the same method using only the weakly supervised labels and the one that only uses the sparse labels.\n\nThe novelty of the method is very limited. It is a multitask UNET. The method is compared with one method using pseudo labels. However, this method is not SOTA. Authors should compare with current methods such as:\n - Where are the Masks: Instance Segmentation with Image-level Supervision\n - Instance Segmentation with Point Supervision\n - Object counting and instance segmentation with image-level supervision\n - Weakly supervised instance segmentation using class peak response\n - Soft proposal networks for weakly supervised object localization\n - Learning Pixel-level Semantic Affinity with Image-level Supervision for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation\nThese methods can use much less supervision (point-level, count-level or image-level) and may work even better.\n\nThe method should be compared on standard and challenging datasets like Cityscapes, PASCAL VOC 2012, COCO, KITTI...\n\n"}
