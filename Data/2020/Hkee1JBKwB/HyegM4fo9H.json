The CTTD factorizes a large convolutional kernel into a chain of smaller tensors, so as to relieve the difficult convergence and overfitting problems caused by too much model params. \nExperiments on Moving-MNIST and KTH datasets show that the proposed method achieved better results than standard ConvLSTM, and in some way comparable with SOTA model. Ablation Studies are also provided.\n\nAlthough it seems novel combing CTTD with ConvLSTM, the idea of CTTD and the combination mainly comes from [Yu et al.,2017] and [Yang et al.,2017]\uff0cthis paper use the method in a new problem of video prediction,  I think the theoretical innovation is not enough for ICLR.\nAlthough the experimental results were better than ConvLSTM(2015), but not as good as PredRNN++(2018), especially in terms of the MSE metrics. Since the prediction accuracy has not yet achieved, I don't think the reduction of model params is a matter of primary importance.  What\u2019s more, Moving-MNIST and KTH are relatively simple datasets, video prediction on a more complicated datasets such as UCF101 will be more convincing.\nConclusion:\nThis paper is in some way novel, but not enough for ICLR, and the experiment results seems not enough convincing, so I will give a weak reject.\n"}
