Nonetheless, they do not fully describe their models or results with enough detail, so it is hard to evaluate this work.\n\n\nContributions:\n\nThis work tackles a relevant problem that seriously impacts speakers of low resource languages.\n\n*What strengths does this paper have?*\n\nIt tackles and interesting problem.\n\n*What weaknesses does this paper have?*\n\nThe authors do not present their models in enough details so that the reader fully understands it.\nThey also only gloss over the results, not presenting them in any concrete form, stating: \u201cWe believe the results obtained were effective in reflecting bet-ter speed, correctness of suggestions (grammatical), and search space since these are the basic issues in word sequence prediction and in assistive technology\u201d. This referred results are not shown in the manuscript though.\n\n\n*Detailed comments:*\n\nThe paper does not use the official conference template. It is also very short, not going in details about the used techniques. Finally, references are not correctly formatted.\n\nSection 1.\n"}
