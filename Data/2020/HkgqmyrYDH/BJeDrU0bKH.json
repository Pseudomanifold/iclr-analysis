The problem tackled is defined as \"word prediction\", which seems to be some form of language modeling. The proposed method combines HMMs with n-grams and morphological and POS features, which are all well established and should be considered more of a (nowadays outdated) baseline. There is no proper evaluation: the experimental settings are not described, and only one number is reported, with nothing to compare to.\n\nTo the authors: Please do not feel discouraged by my review. Your motivation (helping people with dyslexia in Ethiopia) is certainly laudable, but neither the work carried out nor its presentation meets the standards of our research community. I would suggest that you check some of the accepted papers in last year's conference to get a sense of what is expected. I assume that you are new to the field. Don't feel the need to publish your own research from the first day, and take your time to become familiar with the field and study the basic concepts. It takes time, but we all had to go through it :)"}
