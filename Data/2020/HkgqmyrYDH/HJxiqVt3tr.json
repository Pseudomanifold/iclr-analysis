It proposes to use HMMs with POS tags and morphological features to perform this prediction task.\n\n\nThe paper is just 3 pages, contains 1 paragraph of methodology, and no experiments section. It is clearly a very early stage work and not in the scope of ICLR. This paper should have been desk-rejected as it needs more work before it is fit for publication. There is lot of work on word sequence prediction and HMMs are no longer the state-of-the-art. The authors should consider looking at RNN-based methods such as LSTMs for this task."}
