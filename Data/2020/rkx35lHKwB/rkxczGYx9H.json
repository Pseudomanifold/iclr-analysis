The authors develop a general understanding of unseen actions from their characteristic information and train a policy to solve the tasks using the general understanding. The challenge is to extract the action's characteristics from a dataset. This paper presents the HVAE to extract these characteristics and formulates the generalization for policy as the risk minimization.\n\nStrengths:\n1. This paper shows us how to represent the characteristics of the action using the a hierarchical VAE.\n2. From the provided videos, we can directly observe the results of this model applied to different tasks.\n\nWeaknesses:\n1. In the paper, the authors mentioned that they proposed the regularization metrics. However, they didn't describe them in details. It is important to develop the proposed method in theoretical style.\n2. Analyzing the regularization metrics should be careful in the experiments.\n3. Since there are many previous works related to action representation, the experiments should contain the comparison with the other method to see how much improvement was obtained."}
