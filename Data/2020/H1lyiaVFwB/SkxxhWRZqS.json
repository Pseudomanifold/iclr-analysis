These point clouds correspond to objects shapes in 3-dimensions. According to the paper, previous approaches for generating such 3-D point clouds involved autoencoder and GANs used separately. The authors propose a framework combining both autoencoder and GAN in a single network. The authors claim that part of the network learns effective latent space embedding for 3-d point clouds corresponding to different objects and thus the entire network is more effective in generating 3-d point cloud. Experimental results are presented to support the claims for efficient embeddings, and better generation of 3-d point clouds.\n\nDecision\n\nThe paper has some lacking in explanation. I am particularly interested in the answers to the following questions:\n1.\tThe encoder module (denoted as E in the paper) uses a loss function that apparently does not involve the encoder output (z in the paper). How the module weights can be updated this way is unclear.\n2.\tG1 is updated twice in each iteration, according to algorithm 1 in paper (once during update of \ud835\udf3dG1 and \ud835\udf3dG). How the generator G1\u2019s output manages to converge to output z from encoder E is unclear.\n3.\tThe authors claim that the proposed model has both better performance and efficiency. Although experimental results are provided to support claim for better performance, none have been offered for efficiency claim. (calculation of EMD distance seems to be very expensive computationally)\n\nFeedback\n\nFor section 5.5, a quantitative analysis might make the claim for portability of the framework stronger. In paragraph 1 of introduction, disadvantage of 3d point cloud data can be better explained.\n"}
