The idea is to add a regularization term over the GAN loss, and the regularization term measures the distance between the output of the encoder of Autoencoder and that of GAN by two point cloud metrics: Earth Movers's distance (EMD) and Chamfer pseudo-distance (CD). The experiment shows better representation are learnt by this dual generation model. The paper is in a good writing, and easy to read.\n\n``My suggestions:\n\n1) Although this paper is about 3D-point cloud, the idea itself is also feasible for 2D data. In the experiment, a small section is on 2D image data. In order not to confuse readers, I would suggest writing this paper as a general framework on both 2D and 3D data. Is there any particular reason for this work focusing on 3D point cloud data?\n\n2) In 2D data, how to measure the point-cloud distance?still using EMD and CD?\n\n3) In Figure 2, are you trying to minimize the distance between intermedia representation z and \\bar{z} from encoder and GAN respectively as well? I do not find corresponding step in Algorithm 1.\n\n4) How is the lambda changing the results? The regularization is the main idea for this paper, and thus it would be interesting to see how the regularization trades off with the loss.\n\n5) how is EMD's performance compared with CD?"}
