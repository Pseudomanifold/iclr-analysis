In particular for the two-stage region-based detector, like Faster RCNN, the context module is added right before the output layer of the classification head. Every box proposed by the RPN is a node in the CRF, and its label is the classification label. Message passing is unrolled as neural network layers. Potentials are defined based on object detector outputs, box overlap, and co-occurrence of class labels. Experiments are performed on the MS COCO object detection task. \n\nThe proposed method is similar to the CRF-based method for FCN segmentation networks except that the nodes are boxes instead of pixels. And simpler ideas had been explored in the pre-DL era. In this sense, the main idea of this work is incrementally novel. \n\nThe presentation of the paper is fine in general. But the \u201cglobal message passing\u201d paragraph in Sec 4.2 can be improved. In particular, how p(l) is used in message passing? It is better to provide more specific descriptions so that the paper is self-contained.\n\nThe proposed model outperformed the baseline with a reasonably significant margin. However, its average accuracy on all 80 COCO categories is no better than \u201cthe Faster RCNN + Relation\u201d. Since the proposed model is also not significantly simpler than the Relation Network, the experimental results do not establish a new state-of-the-art. \n\nThe experimental results are also a bit thin. More ablative studies can be helpful, e.g., global message parsing/local message passing.\n\nGiven the moderate novelty (which is good but not good enough as a standalone reason to accept this paper) and the not-strong-enough experimental results, I feel more work is needed for the paper to be readily publishable. \n"}
