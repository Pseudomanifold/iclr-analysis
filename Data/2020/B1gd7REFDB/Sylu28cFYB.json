The proposed approach achieves this by embedding a context-aware module into the Faster R-CNN detection framework. The context-aware module simulates the learning process of Conditional Random Fields (CRF) model using a stack of common CNN operations. Specifically, this paper employs the mean-field approach of [1]. Experiments are performed on COCO dataset.\n\nThe  paper reads well. The idea of combining the strengths of both CNNs and CRF-based graphical models in a detection framework is interesting. Though the main idea is borrowed from the mean-field approach of [1], it has been successfully reformulated as a stack of common CNN layers. However, my main concern is that the experimental results (Page 8 Table 2) does not support the merits of the proposed approach. When comparing with the existing Faster R-CNN + Relation work of [2], the improvement provided by the proposed approach is negligible. In fact the proposed approach achieves inferior results on large objects (APL), compared to [2]. [1] uses attention to model the geometric relationships among objects in the same image. In addition to geometric relationships, the proposed approach leverages the inherent co-occurence relationships between object classes. However, this additional information does not seem to provide much help by looking at the results on COCO dataset. The paper does present an experiment to justify this additional information in Table 1. However, that small experiment is only on 6 object categories and does not seem to generalize when going towards full COCO dataset with 80 categories (Table 2). Therefore, the reviewer would recommend to thoroughly evaluate the merits of the proposed approach in depth on COCO and on additional datasets (i.e., Visual Genome). \n\n[1] Philipp Kr\u00e4henb\u00fchl, Vladlen Koltun: Efficient Inference in Fully Connected CRFs with Gaussian Edge Potentials.
