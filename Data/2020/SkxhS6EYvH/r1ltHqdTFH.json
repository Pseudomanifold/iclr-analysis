They want to provide a solution to the problem that when Y is a deterministic function of X, traditional IB Lagrangian can not explore the whole IB curve. The authors introduce a general family of convex IB Lagrangian, and prove that there exists a bijective mapping between the IB curve and IB Lagrangian multiplier. Several experiments are conducted to prove the performance of power IB Lagrangian and exponential Lagrangian.\n\nThe problem that IB Lagrangian multiplier can not explore the IB curve is worth understanding and fixing. However, the convex IB Lagrangian is not very different from the square IB Lagragians. Firstly, the authors didn't point out any deficiencies for using square IB Lagrangian, so the motivation of using other convex IB Lagrangian are not strong. Also, the theories about convex IB Lagrangian seem to be a simple generalization of the theories of square IB Lagrangian. Finally, the experiment results for square IB Lagrangian and exponential IB Lagrangian are quite similar. \n\nTherefore, the whole paper seem to be too incremental, compared to square IB Lagrangian. I think the contribution of this paper is not enough to be accepted.   "}
