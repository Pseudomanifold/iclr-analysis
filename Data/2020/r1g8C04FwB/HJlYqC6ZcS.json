Summary\nThis paper presents the use of splines to generate handwritten characters and words from handwriting fonts. This is a form of synthetic handwriting dataset that can then be used to identify characters on real handwritten OCR or train ML models to be more robust.\n\n2. Questions\n- The experiments are not really clearly spelt out. You can improve your captions on tables to make it easier to read. \n- If you combined the data (Synthetic and real) are there performance improvements that are better than not having any?\n- Would there be a way to reject the proposed generated new handwriting sample?\n-\n\n3. Other Comments\n- Please fix the formatting of the tables."}
