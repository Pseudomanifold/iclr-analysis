It learns to generate a collection of coordinate offset \u0394k for each of the convolutional kernel element. Then during convolution, the kernel is treated as a 2D regular grid and sampled (interpolated) according to the generated coordinate offset before applying to the inputs. An auxiliary shallow network is learned to generate those coordinate offsets based in inputs. This method is very similar to the existing \"deformable convolution\" algorithm, though this operate on the kernels instead. Numerical experiments on image classification and object detection tasks show that the method performs better or comparably to strong baselines. It boost the performance even more when combined with existing methods.\n\nThis paper is relatively easy to follow and the ideas are simple and effective.\n\nMy main concern about this paper is the novelty given its similarity to the previous methods. Maybe it could improve if more and in-depth studies are shown that analyze what deformable kernel learns and why that is different from what deformable convolution learn. "}
