The arms of the bandit are parameters of the policy such as exploration noise, per-action biases etc. A proxy fitness metric is defined that measures the return of the trajectories upon perturbations of the policy z; the bandit then samples perturbations z that are better than the average fitness of the past few perturbations.\n\nI think this paper is just below the acceptance threshold. My reservations and comments are as follows.\n\n1. While I see the value in designing an automatic exploration mechanism, the complexity of the underlying approach makes the contribution of the bandit-based algorithm difficult to discern from the large number of other bells and whistles in the experiments. For instance, the authors use Rainbow as  the base algorithm upon which they add on the exploration. Rainbow itself is an extremely complicated algorithm, how can one be certain that the improvements in performance are caused by the improved exploration and not a combination of the bandit\u2019s actions with the specifics of Rainbow?\n2. I don\u2019t understand Figure 4. The score defined in Appendix is the average over games for which seed performs better. Why is the random seed being used to compare the performance of different arms? Do you instead mean that s and s\u2019 are two values of the arm in Figure 4? If not, how should one interpret Figure 4, no fixed arm is always good because the performance varies across the seeds. The curated bandit does not seem to be doing any better than a fixed arm.\n\nI have a few more questions that I would like the authors to address in their rebuttal or the paper.\n\n1. The proxy f(z) does not bear any resemblance to LP(z). Why discuss the LP(z) then. The way f(z) is defined, it is just the value function averaged over perturbations  of the policy. If one were to consider z as an additional action space that is available to the agent during exploration, f(z) is the value function itself. The exploration policy is chosen not to maximize the E_z [f(z)] directly but to maximize the lower bound in Markov\u2019s inequality (P(f(z) >= t) <= E_z [f(z)]/t) in Section 4.\n2. Can you elaborate more on the metric for measuring the learning progress LP? Why does the myopic metric make sense in spite of the there being plateaus in the training curves?\n3. The key contribution of the paper that the authors could highlight better is that they do not add new hyper-parameters. In this aspect, the auto-tuner for exploration is a plug-and-play procedure in other RL algorithms.\n4. From Figure 6 and Figure 8-11, it looks like the bandit is more or less on par with fixed exploration policies. What is the benefit of the added complexity?"}
