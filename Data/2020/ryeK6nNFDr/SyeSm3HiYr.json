The proposed method seems promising, and empirical evaluations are reasonable.\n\nHowever, I find that the proposed MBF detection metric is much more complicated to calculate than any of its baselines, e.g., LID or K-density. So I wonder if the good performance of MBF mainly comes from its \u2019complexity\u2018. I mean, if we use the feature vectors of different layers in CNNs and combine them with a different non-linear function and feed into an SVM classifier,  can we still obtain a hard-to-evade detector? I think a fair complexity is particularly important when you try to evade the detector by optimization-based adaptive attacks and claim superiority over other baselines."}
