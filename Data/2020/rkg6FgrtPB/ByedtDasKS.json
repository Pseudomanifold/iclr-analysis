The aim of developing this method is to provide a biological alternative to back-propagation. The authors prove that their method converges and with high probability succeeds in learning linear classification problems. Another method is also proposed which is linked to dopaminergic neurons.\n\nIn terms of presentation, the paper is generally clear and well-written. I was not able to assess the importance of the theoretical contributions of the work as my research is not in this area, so my comments are limited to the other aspects.\n\nWith regard to the biological plausibility of the method, it is unclear to me how the evolutionary method proposed here can enable learning in typical scenarios such as conditioning experiments in animals. The learning processes in animals typically occurs in short time spans (for example a few training sessions for conditioning to stimuli predicting food/no food) and therefore I don\u2019t find it plausible to suggest evolutionary methods across generations are behind such forms of learning. Perhaps what the authors have in mind applies more to other forms of behaviour such as innate and involuntary responses in animals formed across generations rather than ongoing updates in synaptic plasticity as an animal adjusts its behaviour using environmental feedback. But then in this case the biological plausibility of the method seems fairly limited and not really an alternative to methods such as back-propagation.\n\nThe other biological aspect of the proposed work is the connection to dopamine and using the sign of gradients for updating the weights. I think connecting the current learning rule to the activity of dopamine neurons requires quantitative comparisons with experimental data, otherwise although I agree that the method is biologically inspired, but whether it is biologically plausible is not clear.\n\nBased on the above comments, I think the work will benefit from further developments before being ready for publication."}
