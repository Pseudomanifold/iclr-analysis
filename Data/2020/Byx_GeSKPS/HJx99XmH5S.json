First, a local alignment model based on multi-instance learning is applied to build the semantic correspondences within a data-text pair. Then, a global alignment model built on top of a memory guided conditional random field (CRF) layer is designed to exploit dependencies among alignments in the entire training corpus, where the memory is used to integrate the alignment clues provided by the local alignment model.\nThis paper is well written and the experiments are also sufficient.\nIn eq.(11), how parameter \\lambda affects the final results?"}
