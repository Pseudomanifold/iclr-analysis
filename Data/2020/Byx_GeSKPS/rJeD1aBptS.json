The paper has to do with \u201clearning semantic correspondences\u201d between text and some sort of database-like representations. \n\nI can really say only two things that might be useful. \n\nFirst, the paper is not at all effective at explaining its topic to a reader outside of natural language processing. I read carefully but was never able to get any sense of what problem was being solved. I was never able to understand what the inputs to the algorithm were, or the outputs, or why it might be sensible to think one could have those inputs, or want those outputs. I had trouble understanding any part of the paper at any level.\n\nSecond, I can say that almost every sentence in the paper is not grammatical English. There are problems of singular/plural, in the use of articles, and unlikely combinations of verbs, subjects, and objects.\n"}
