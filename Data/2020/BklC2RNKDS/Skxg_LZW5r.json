The bulk of work is in deriving bound propagation rules for the STL language. The resulting lower bound of an auxiliary quantity (which is required to be non-negative) is then maximized for verifiability.\n\nThis technique is demonstrated on three tasks and compares favorably to the baseline from Wang et al. (2019).\n\nI am not an expert in this area. However, to the best of my knowledge I don't see anything immediately wrong with this and it seems novel. Therefore I recommend acceptance.\n\nThe paper is also above recommended length."}
