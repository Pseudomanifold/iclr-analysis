The approach proposed is built on top of a recent well performing model by Lee et al. The improvement is rather minor in my view: 72.64 to 72.84 in the test set. \n\nThere is not much in the paper to review. I don't think the one extra feature warrants a paper at a top conference. The weighting mechanism over the features is also unclear to me why it benefits from attention. Couldn't we just learn the weights using another layer? It could be context dependent if desired.\n\nIt is also incorrect to criticise Lee et al. (2018) that they would give the same representation to the same mention every time. Their model is context dependent as they use a BiLSTM over the sentence. Of course the same mentions are likely to get similar representations, but this is desirable."}
