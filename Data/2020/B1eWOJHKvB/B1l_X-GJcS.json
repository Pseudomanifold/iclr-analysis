CycleGAN has attracted a lot of attention in unpaired image-to-image translation. Although the basic idea of CycleGAN seem sensible, its precise behavior is not totally clear--can one really avoid mismatch with CycleGAN? Do we need additional constraints? This paper provides a nice answer the the first question.\n\nOverall I enjoyed reading this paper. The addressed issue is important, the investigation is reasonable, and the results are intuitive and plausible, with clear practical implications. I think it is a good paper.\n\n  "}
