The explanation boils down to the fact that the eigenfunctions of convolutions correspond to bandpass filters. This can explain surprising phenomena: bandpass filters arising when training on random noise inputs. The paper could have been even more interesting if some or more of the other questions had been considered:\n\n1. The effect of training on a specific dataset had been explained: how do the resulting filters change and how does that tie in with the theory?\n\n2. Some light shed on 3D filters in higher layers of the network.\n\n3. Whether any guiding principles emerge for conv. layer construction. \n "}
