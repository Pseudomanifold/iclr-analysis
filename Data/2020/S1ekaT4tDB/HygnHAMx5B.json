This phenomenon typically is explained via appeal to natural image statistics, i.e., natural images are dominated by oriented contours manifest across a variety of scales and oriented bandpass filters are well matched to such structure. \n\nContribution: This paper proposes an explanation in terms of the structure of convolutional networks themselves: Given that\ntheir convolutional layers necessarily operate within the space of convolutions, learning oriented bandpass filters provides the system with the potential to span possible input, even while preserving a notion of locality in the signal domain.\n\nQuestion: What is possible implication and applications of this  explanation in practice. It will be useful to add discussion and experimental results to show the advantage of this explanation in real applications."}
