The paper proposes a lens by which to view this tradeoff, mathematically quantifying quality and diversity, and showing that there is a Pareto frontier associated with these quantities. The paper proposes a method for controlling quality and diversity of a learned model and evaluates it on a few datasets.\n\nOverall, I found several gaps in the story of the paper which makes me skeptical of the entire paper, leading to my recommendation of reject.\n\n-- In Eq 2, x is used both as an argument to a function and as a free variable in an integral. The intended equation is unclear.\n-- This happens again in Eq 3.\n-- It is unclear how the trade-off of the learned model is controlled exactly. For example, in Alg 1, how does one control for different desired quality/diversity trade-offs?"}
