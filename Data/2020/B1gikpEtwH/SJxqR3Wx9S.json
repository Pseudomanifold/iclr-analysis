The method employs the convolutional adversarial variational autoencoder for anomaly detection and uses guided attention (AVAGA) to localize the anomalous region in the image. Adversarial autoencoder and attention map are jointly trained in the end-to-end manner. Unsupervised and weakly-supervised settings are presented. \n\n---Strength---\nMost of existing methods need to tune the threshold for anomaly score using a small number of abnormal validation samples. The method in this paper bypasses the tuning of the threshold. Instead, only normal samples are used to  learn an attention map to localize the anomaly.\n\n---Weakness---\nTwo main ingredients in the proposed method (CAVAE and attention map via Grad-CAM) are known techniques, although such combination is a new interesting approach to anomaly detection and localization. \n"}
