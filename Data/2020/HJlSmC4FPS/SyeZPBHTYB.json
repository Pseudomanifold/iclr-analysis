With analysis, the paper concludes that the dimensions of subspaces of image features are adaptively changing according to the noise level. An interesting result is that the MSE is proportional to sigma instead of sigma^2 when using bias-free networks, which provides some theoretical evidence of advantage of using BF-CNN.\n\nOne main practical concern is that only Gaussian noise is considered in this paper which provides good theoretical analysis. It would be interesting to see if this BF-CNN is extendable to more noise types.\n\nOne unclear statement is that for UNet, the Lemma 1 seems to be no longer valid as skip connections exist. Can you provide additional proof that the scale invariance still holds in this case?\n\n"}
