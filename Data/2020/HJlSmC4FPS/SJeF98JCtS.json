This paper shows that removing constant terms from CNN models provides strong generalization across noise levels. Also, this paper provides the interpretability of the denoising model based on a linear-algebra method.\n\nQ1. Is there the possibility that the model without the constant term shows strong generalization in other image processing tasks such as image deblurring and dehazing? It would be better to discuss this point to make the scope of the proposed method clear.\n\nQ2. About the visualization of the linear weighting functions in Figure 4, what can we figure out from the visualization, especially for image denoising? If possible, please elaborate on it."}
