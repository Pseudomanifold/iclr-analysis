However, the proposed method has only a very incremental novelty compared to SPORF and the previous approaches in computer vision (e.g., Shotton et al., 2011). Although the authors claim the method can take advantage of structure in all kinds of data, the only conducted experiment is on the image data which is fairly limited.\n\nIn Fig. 1, they claim MORF outperforms other methods given fewer training data. However, for classifying\u00a0Orthogonal Bars, CNN still outperforms MORF when few training data are given. The results on MNIST is also not impressive. CNN is still much better compared to other tree-based methods. Moreover, no other real-world dataset has been conducted experiments on.\n\nIn general, the paper's goal is clear and interesting. But the authors failed to propose a novel method and the results are not convincing. Hence, I recommend rejection.\n"}
