It is motivated by that, natural data is often in some manifold but not randomly distributed. It showed how to use the 2D spatial structures of natural images by constructing structured atoms. Results on 3 toy examples and MNIST showed the better performance than standard RF and SPORF.\n\nOverall, the paper is easy to follow and well written. The idea is intuitive: using structured 2D information to improve the classification results. But there are some issues with the implemetation.\n\n1. In image classification, we definitely need 2D structure information. This is normally extracted by the descriptors such as SIFT, GIST, where the 2D information has been included. It is rare to use the pixel values as the features directly for classification.   In this case, the benefit of the proposed method is very weak. This is the main issue of the paper. No results on real features.\n\n2. The results are weak too. The real data is MNIST, which is also a very toy dataset. It would be good to include some real world image dataset, such as CIFAR, ImageNet etc.\n\n3. The algorithm is somehow incremental compared with SPORF. \n"}
