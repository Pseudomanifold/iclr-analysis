It shows a rather extensive set of simulations, that enrich the observations of the so-called double descent phenomena, and shows empirically its apparent generality. Also, the Effective Model Complexity seems to be a good description of what is empirically observe. All in all, i definitely support publication.\n\nI have, however, two comments: first, a minor one: there is a part of the story on double descent that is completely forgotten: the fact that there is a pic in the data for some classificators at #example close to #parameters was known at least in the 90! It is discussed in \"Statistical Mechanics of Learning\" A. Engel & C. Van den Broeck, 2001, page 61, with a plot that  comes rather from an old work of Pr. Manfred Opper (1995), can be seen here: http://www.ki.tu-berlin.de/fileadmin/fg135/publikationen/opper/Op01.pdf FIG 10 \nFrom this work, it is also rather clear that increasing the number of training examples can hurt performances (this is exactly what the plot says), at least without regularisation. Since the authors are quite thorough in their review of history -especially in the appendix- I thought I would point this reference.\n\nThe second comment is that the paper should acknowledge the work of the  Geiger et al more explicitly, and cite as well the related work of  Spiegler et al (https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.09665) rather explicitly! Virtually all they show was already shown in this work (which by the way PREDATES Belkin et al), albeit only for a simpler set of data.  I agree that the authors extend a lot on this papers, especially in terms of dataset and completeness of experiments, but they are definitely closely related, and the fact that it is not cited is a serious flaw to the current version.\n\nAlso, in the conclusion  \"We note that many of the phenomena that we highlight often do not occur with optimal early- stopping. However, this is consistent with our generalized double descent hypothesis:\u2026\". Again this was shown (empirically) as well in the above mentioned papers and also explained in \"physics terms\" where the peak is like a phase transition (jamming), if one stop the dynamics.\n\n"}
