EMC depends on several factors such as data distribution and architecture of the classifier. \n \nThe paper empirically shows that the double descent phenomenon occurs as a function of EMC. \n\nThe paper provides interesting perspectives of their experiments and gives the intuitions for these observations. However, these are mainly hypotheses.\n\nI like the paper for its rigorous experiments and providing intutions from their observations.\n\nHowever, I am very new to this area of research and will only provide my review on my understanding.", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "N/A"}
