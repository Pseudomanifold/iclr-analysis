In particular, the substitution of the input image follows three published paradigms: Sliding Patch (SP), Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), Meaningful Perturbation (MP). Whereas the states of the art use gray images (SP, LIME)/blurred versions (MP) as substitution on different spatial supports (regular patch SP, random-shaped superpixel regions LIME, learned continuous region MP), the proposed approach inserts there the output of the inpainting.   \nThere are problems in the paper, major and minor.\nMajor: \n1)\tThe technical contribute is minimal, the author combine two already existent techniques.\n2)\tThe results are not convincing: a) the comparison are not fair, since on two out of three techniques the authors consistently change the competitors, letting them work with zero-value occluders or random noise. Only the third competitor has been employed in is original form (blurring the images). b) results are better (higher classification drop, plus other metrics) with the proposed approach wrt the first two competitors, which looks strange. Can the authors try to apply the comparative approaches in their original versions?\n3)\tThe fact that we are using an inpainting tool which may work in some cases (in providing well-distributed patches) but in other may fail, corrupting consequently the overall following analysis is a price I don\u2019t want to pay, so I prefer some synthetical but controlled artifact. Actually, in the case of inpainting failure will generate structured noise, hard to be managed.   \nMinor/improvements\n--In the introduction the authors should spend a little more two or three words in explaining on which basis Adebayo et al. 2018 questions the correctness of the heatmap, since this is something on which the authors are building their hypothesis.\n--The title is misleading, the authors are talking about generic feature removal but in reality we are considering the image domain only.(check)\n--Figure 1\u2019s caption should report the references for the three SP LIME and MP\n"}
