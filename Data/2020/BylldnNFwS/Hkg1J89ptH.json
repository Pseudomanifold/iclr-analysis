Summary of the paper\n\nThis paper describes the decision boundaries of a certain class of\nneural networks (piecewise linear, non-linear activation functions)\nthrough the lens of tropical geometry.\nAn earlier result by Zhang et al. (2018) is extended to multi-class\nclassification problems (technically, only the result for a binary\nclassification is given in the main text, though).\n\nSimilar to this earlier work, the network is shown to be represented as\na tropical rational function. The dual subdivision of this function is\nshown to be represented as the convex hull of two zonotopes.\n\nThis characterisation is used to explain different phenomena of neural\nnetwork training, viz. the 'lottery ticket hypothesis', network\npruning, and adversarial attacks.\n\n2. Summary of the review\n\nThis is a highly interesting paper with a very relevant subject. I think\nthat the perspective of tropical geometry leads to valuable insights. My\nbackground is *not* in tropical geometry, so this paper required several\npasses to fully grasp.\n\nI like the novel insights that this paper creates; it is very interesting\nto observe known phenomena via tropical geometry. I appreciate the\nthorough description of all concepts in this paper. This is to some\nextent both 'boon and bane': on the one hand, the paper contains a lot\nof information and concepts that need to be understood; on the other\nhand, the experiments go *wide* but not *deep*. I suggest to accept the\npaper, but to fully endorse it, I would recommend to work on the\nfollowing issues:\n\n- Clarity & exposition: In some places, the paper could build intuition\n  for non-experts (such as myself) better. This is closely tied to the\n  second point.\n\n- Focus: I would maybe pick *one* or *two* of the experimental areas and\n  use the remaining space to explain all concepts in more detail, build\n  some intuition, and provide a more in-depth setup. Nothing has to\n  removed of course; it could still be put in the appendix.\n\nThis paper has the potential to be a very strong insightful contribution\nto to our community; the authors are to be commended!\n\n3. Detailed comments (clarity)\n\nThe paper describes its concepts well and has a high information\ndensity. At times, there is the risk that readers are provided with too\nmuch information in the main text, leaving the necessary intuition\nsomewhat lacking (unless they are already experts in the subject matter,\nin which case a lot of the information can be skipped).\n\nI realise that writing a paper based on methods that are not yet\nwell-established is no small feat; the authors are to be commended for\nthat!\n\nHere are some suggestions from someone with a background in differential\ntopology:\n\n- The introduction and contributions are somewhat repetitive; I would\n  suggest merging the 'Contributions.' paragraph with the one preceding\n  it\n\n- Even though it *should* be a well-known definition, I would briefly\n  explain that the semiring lacks an additive inverse\n\n- Add an explanation of the tropical quotient to Definition 1; I find\n  the current phrasing of Definition 3 to be confusing at first glance\n\n- What are *upper faces*? Faces with a specific coordinate fixed?\n\n- A definition of $\\pi$ is required. It is my understanding that $\\pi$\n  is a projection function that 'drops' the last coordinate. Is this\n  correct? If so, it should be briefly mentioned on p. 3; else, the\n  discussion about the bias-free case on p. 4 cannot be understood.\n\n- Theorem 2 lacks an 'intuitive' formulation; the results are stated in\n  a terse mathematical fashion, but it would be helpful (also in light\n  of the subsequent discussion) to briefly comment on their *meaning*.\n\n  For example, the first result could be restated as 'the decision\n  boundary is a subset of a tropical hypersurface of the polynomial\n  $R(x)$'.\n\n  The paragraph 'Theorem 2 bridges the gap...' could maybe also be moved\n  to _precede_ the theorem statement.\n\n- The paper refers to $\\mathcal{T}(R(x))$ as a super-set, but in my\n  understanding, it is a *level set* because Definition 4 uses an\n  equality, not an inequality. Am I misunderstanding this? One potential\n  misinterpretation of my part could be that superset refers to the fact\n  that $\\mathcal{B} \\subseteq \\mathcal{T}(R(x))$; so not a superset\n  in the sense of level set analysis, but rather a superset in terms of\n  set theory. If this is the case, maybe rephrase the sentence above to\n  something like 'boundaries $\\mathcal{B}$ through their superset\n  $\\mathcal{T}(R(x))$ according to the first statement of Theorem 2'.\n\n- What does the colour map in Figure 2 depict? The number of iterations?\n  Moreover, I find the polytope though to understand at first glance;\n  how is it related to the decision boundaries that are shown in the\n  leftmost figure?\n\n- I would suggest to place Figure 1 after stating Theorem 2, since it is\n  only referenced later on. Furthermore, the red structures are somewhat\n  confusing. According to Theorem 2, the decision boundary is a subset\n  of the hypersurface, right? What is the relation of the red structures\n  in the convex hull visualisation? The caption states that they are\n  normals, but as far as I can tell, this has not been formalised\n  anywhere in the paper (it is used later on, though).\n\n- To what extent is the existence of the functions described by Theorem 2\n  unique? On p. 5, in Section 4, the paper alludes to *not* using the\n  functional form of the network directly because it does not seem to be\n  unique. I would like this to be explained a in more details, as\n  I found the justification of why the dual subdivision is used quite\n  hard to follow.\n\n- In Section 4, how many experiments of the sort were performed? I find\n  this a highly instructive view so I would love to see more experiments\n  of this sort. Do these claims hold over multiple repetitions and for\n  (slightly) larger architectures as well?\n\n  Please also see my comments on Figure 2 above.\n\n- The claim that orientations are preserved should be formalised.\n  I immediately understand the intuition behind this concept, but\n  if possible, I would like a quantification of this. Might it be\n  possible to *measure* changes in orientation with respect to an\n  original polytope? If so, it should be possible to provide more\n  experiments about these effects and summarise them accordingly.\n  Maybe it would also be interesting to investigate whether other\n  initialisations can be compared in terms of their orientations?\n\n- In Section 5, I would give a brief link to the appendix for the\n  definition of a Minkowski sum.\n\n- Section 5 has (in contrast to the other sections) a lot of details\n  containing the experimental setup, but it is missing a description of\n  the competitor methods. Adding to what I wrote above, I feel that the\n  paper should rather pick *one* area in which experiments are\n  performed; the pruning (together with the lottery ticket hypothesis\n  explanation, which could be seen as a motivating example) strikes me\n  as a good candidate for this.\n\n  I really like this concept of tropical pruning, by the way---it is an\n  elegant, principled description!\n\n- The plots in Figure 4 should summarise multiple pruning runs, if\n  possible. Why not show a standard deviation as well? Given the\n  stochasticity of training, I would think this highly necessary.\n\n- In Section 6, I find the comment on normals generating a superset to\n  the decision boundaries hard to understand.\n\n-  The perspective of perturbing the network such that the decision\n   boundaries change is really interesting, but I am missing\n   a 'take-away message' or a discussion of the insights. Currently,\n   this section seems more like a feasibility study: it appears to be\n   possible to use the tropical description to find new parameters that\n   misclassify a given input. I would propose a discussion of the\n   implications of these findings. \n\n- Concerning future extensions of this work, are there some promising\n  results or directions for CNNs or GCNs? If so, it would strengthen\n  the conclusion if they were mentioned.\n\n4. Minor style issues\n\nThe paper is well-written. I found some minor style issues:\n\n- 'piece-wise' --> 'piecewise' (occur multiple times)\n- 'recently demonstrated' --> 'demonstrated'\n- 'Thereafter, tropical hypersurfaces divide' --> 'Tropical hypersurfaces divide'\n- 'If set $B$ --> 'Letting B'\n- I am not sure if I would call adversarial attacks a 'nuisance'; maybe rather a 'problem'?\n- Use '\\operatorname' or '\\mathrm' to typeset the loss in Eq. 5"}
