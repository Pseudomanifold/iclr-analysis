In particular, the authors show the radius at which a smoothed classifier g at under Gaussian perturbations is certified for the top k predictions. That is to say that the prediction will remain within the top k predictions of g. Setting k=1, one recovers Cohen et al. results. The authors show that the derived radius is tight.\n\nComments.\n\nI generally find the work interesting and I do not have any major criticism. The paper is also easy to read. I did not go through the tightness proof but I skimmed through proof of the certified radius and I find that the argument follows in a similar fashion to previous works using NP lemma.\n\nMay the authors comment on the following.\n\na) How does the method scale with k? - speedwise particularly when estimating the lower and upper bounds of the output probabilities.\n\nb) I do not understand Figure 3. Can the authors comment why for the radius = 0 the certified accuracy of the larger sigma (1.0) is actually worse than the smaller sigma? At least when k=1, increasing sigma increases the certified radius in which I expect to see that most of the samples to be actually within the radius and it should perform much better than lower sigma {0.25,0.5}. \n\nc) Based on the previous comment, I find the performance in Figure 3 in not consistent with the authors' discussion in page 7 \"when sigma is larger, the accuracy under no attacks (i.e. the accuracy when radius is 9) is larger .. \".\n\nd) Authors use bisection to find the solution to the certified accuracy for every t. Bisection is known to only enjoy linear convergence rate. Have the authors considered using algorithms that are much faster such as the sueprlinear secant method?\n\ne) Page 3 bullet point 3. \"it is impossible to certify a L_2 radius\" >> \"it is impossible to certify an \\ell_2 radius\".
