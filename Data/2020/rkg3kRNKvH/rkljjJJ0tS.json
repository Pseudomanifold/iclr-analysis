It mentions many aspects where embeddings can be used as common-sense knowledge. However, the paper lacks both novelty and in-depth analysis.  Most methods proposed are basically computing the cosine distances between language embeddings pairs and find the closest one. It's hard to imagine how to scale up this process in real applications. And most of the analyses are based on cherry-picked examples rather than evaluation with quantitative metrics. "}
