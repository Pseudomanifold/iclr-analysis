The applied methods are introduced in detail. But it lacks some more detailed analysis.\n\nMy concerns are as follows.\n1. The idea of using the concept of age is not new. There are many studies that have been conducted using the concept of aging in the literature of evolutionary algorithms.\n2. Multi-objective optimizations involve finding a set of optimal solutions for different and often competing objectives. However, the authors did not provide the analysis that the age and the accumulated task reward are conflicting with each other.\n3. It would be better the average survival time of the individuals is presented in this paper."}
