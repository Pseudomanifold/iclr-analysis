In place of hand-engineered distribution choices, they introduce the use of GANs as a tool for Evolution Strategies. I liked the novelty of combining the use of GANs in new directions (namely ES/GA).\n\nThe core idea is to model the density function using Generative Neural Networks (GNN, MacKay 1995), and find the parameters of this GNN using tools from the normalizing flows literature for their NICE invertible properties (okay pun intended :) along with GAN-style training using historical data from the ES process.\n\nThey demonstrate their method on traditional blackbox optimization toy tasks (such as Rosenbrok and Rastrigin functions), and also on a few continuous control RL benchmark tasks, to demonstrate improved performance over a strong representative ES algorithm (XNES).\n\nOverall, I liked the work as it provides a fresh way of using GANs with another subfield (ES/GA). If they want to improve the work, I would suggest demonstrating that their approach can solve certain difficult tasks that traditional ES methods (or RL methods) cannot solve. Although the experiments chosen are not difficult ones, I believe they were chosen for clarity to showcase the method, so I think that is fine (in case there are complaints that they experiments are too simple).\n\n(For the record, I was looking to give a score of 7, but the ICLR system made me choose between 6 and 8, and I chose 8.)"}
