The algorithm is an extension of a previous one. Since the idea is very simple, one would expect a lot of theory, but the main theoretical result in Section 4 can be copy-pasted from the previous algorithm since they share the same result. Three sources are cited, indicating either a very narrow view of the field, or overconfidence in the fundamental significance of the contribution.\n\nThe experiments show the technique works as advertised, but the importance of the result is low."}
