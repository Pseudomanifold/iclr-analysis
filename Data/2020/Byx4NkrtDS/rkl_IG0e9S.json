The proposed method is inspired by the concept of cognitive map in human and animal. \nA recurrent neural network is incorporated and training is divided in two steps of (1) task-agnostic pre-training and (2) task-speci\ufb01c Q learning.\n\nThe paper is well-written and clear.\n\nWhile the idea of using a representation inspired by cognitive maps is interesting, the paper does not offer much technical novelty. (e.g no technical novelty in eq. 1 and eq. 2)\n\nThe experimental results are weak and only a simple domain is tested.  \n\nIt is not clear how efficient the method would be compared to other approaches.\n\nVisualizations can be improved. As an example, Fig. 4 is not quite self-representative.\n\nI see the paper has a large room for improvement and the current manuscript is not convincing for publication.\n"}
