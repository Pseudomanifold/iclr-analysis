To address the problems in current unsupervised domain adaptation methods, the authors propose to a novel multi-step framework which works in a decentralized and distributed manner. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. \n\nThis paper is well-motivated and the proposed method is novel for unsupervised domain adaptation. The paper is well-supported by theoretical analysis, however, the improvements are not that significant on some experimental results. For the above reasons, I tend to accept this paper but wouldn't mind rejecting it. \n\nQuestions: \n1. The experiments do not really show the superiority of the proposed method compared to the common centralized approaches as they have similar performances on both collaborator selection and distributed domain adaptation. Can you convince the readers more with some other experiments?\n2. What is the weakness of such decentralization models?"}
