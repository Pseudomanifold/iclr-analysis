The main body of this paper is the quantum singular value decomposition algorithm from Kerenidis & Prakash, 2016. The authors propose some plug-in algorithms in the context of quantum computing. Moreover, this paper does not evaluate the proposed algorithm with any comparative experiments. Personally speaking, it is better to submit the work to the physics journals. "}
