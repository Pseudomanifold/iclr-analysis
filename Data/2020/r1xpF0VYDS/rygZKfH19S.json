Finding efficient ways to estimate eigen-vectors of the Hessian would have a dramatic impact on second-order optimization techniques (neglecting the practical implications of it being a quantum algorithm). Since the paper is submitted to a machine learning conference I believe more efforts should be done to make the paper accessible to researchers unfamiliar to quantum computing.\n\nComments\n\nI appreciate the clarification of the notation at section 2.1, however many exotic notation for machine learning researchers are presented before this section without any reference to 2.1. The operation `\\propto` (latex) is never explained. My understanding is that it is the update of a quantum state?\n\nThe section 2.2 should give a brief overview of why both techniques will be useful for the many parts of the contributed algorithms.\n\nI could not find definition of T_H anywhere."}
