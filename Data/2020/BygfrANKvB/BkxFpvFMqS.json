The authors provide a transformer based model to predict the reactants. Existing methods do not generalize well for rare reactions and the training data has only one reactant set for each target even though that may not be the only way to synthesize the compound. To solve this problem, the authors use a pretraining method similar to BERT. Instead of just using token masking, they provide alternate proxy decompositions for a target molecule by randomly removing bond types that are likely to break and by transforming the target based on known templates.\n\nThis is a well written paper with good baselines.They use multiple techniques that are both domain specific (data augmentation) as well as methods from NLP adapted for this task. The experiments are carefully designed and show that both pretraining and data augmentation helps. Overall, I think the community will benefit from this work."}
