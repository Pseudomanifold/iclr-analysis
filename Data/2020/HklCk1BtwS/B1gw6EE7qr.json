To this end, the authors consider the matrix factorization framework, previously introduced in the literature, and also study the influence of an hyperparameter denoted by alpha. Roughly speaking, there are two major parts in the paper. On one hand, it explains the reasons why the word embedding schemas provide nice properties, by defining the embedding as a low rank transformation mechanism. On the other hand, they propose to choose optimally the hyperparameter alpha in order to ameliorate word embedding by better preserving the distance structure. Conducted experiments are convincing.\n\nThe paper is well written, and derivations seem correct.\n\nWe think that the major issue in this work is that it does not provide significant contributions with respect to the state of the art. It seems that the contributions are rather incremental compared to related works, such as Levy et al. 2015 and Yin & Shen 2018. In the latter, it is proven that most existing word embedding schemas can be formulated as low rank matrix approximations, either explicitly or implicitly. The submitted paper does not provide new significant results.\n\nMoreover, the authors have failed to provide connections to other related works, or even cite them, including papers that consider word embedding as asymmetric low-rank projections.
