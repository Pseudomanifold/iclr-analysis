In the first half of the paper, the general framework of the Bayes estimation is introduced. Then, The authors proposed how to incorporate GAN to the Bayesian inference. Some computational methods for calculating the mean of the statistic under the posterior distribution are described. Then, numerical experiments using MNIST and Celeb-A datasets are presented. \n\nThough the Bayesian inference using GAN is a natural idea, learning algorithms proposed in this paper are simple and are not intensively developed. In numerical experiments, there is no comparison with major competitors besides random sampling in the active learning setup. Hence, the effectiveness and advantage of the proposed methods are not clear.\n- In active learning, the proposed method should be compared with other methods such as Bayesian DNN using dropout, etc. \n- How does the estimation accuracy of GAN relate to the estimation accuracy of the proposed method? Showing a quantitative description would be nice.\n"}
