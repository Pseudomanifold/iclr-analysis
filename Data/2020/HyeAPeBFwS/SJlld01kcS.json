As for me, the best application of this paper is to restore a corrupted image, which shares a lot of common properties in image restoration, denoising and image reconstruction. I do like the extension of applying the idea in physics problems. And the results demonstrate at some extent, the proposed method could evaluate some uncertainty. \n\nThe idea is pretty simple and the paper is easy to read.  Nonetheless, there are some issues:\n\nA big issue of this paper is the deviation of purpose and method. As the paper claims to quantify the uncertainty, the paper is supposed to give specific quantitative metric or values to probe the uncertainty. However, the paper demonstrates to us only the ability, not exactly \u201cquantification\u201d. I\u2019d like to see a specific metric of uncertainty that could only be calculated through the proposed method. \n\nThere are some grammar issues in the paper. For example. \u201c\u2026we the MAP\u2026\u201d in the 7th page.\n\nGiven my major issue seems to be quite problematic, I currently would weakly reject this paper. But I don\u2019t have a full picture over this area, I\u2019ll read the rebuttal and see if I could raise the score."}
