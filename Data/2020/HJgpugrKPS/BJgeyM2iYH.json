To achieve this, the authors developed the scale-convolution blocks in the network, and generalized other common blocks, such as pooling and nonlinearity, to remain scale-equivariant. Extensive experiments have been conducted to show that the proposed scale-equivariant network\n(a) is indeed scale-equivariant even with numerical discretization\n(b) achieves better classification performance when compared to non-scale-equivariant networks as well as previously proposed locally-scale invariant networks.\n\nOverall, this is a very good paper. The paper is well-written and well-organized. The newly proposed scale-convolution is the most general way of achieving scale-equivariant representations. Experiments are convincing and justifies the usage of the proposed architecture in dealing with multi-scale inputs.\n\nOne question to ask that does not effect my rating:\nThere is a very similar paper submitted to this conference:\nhttps://openreview.net/forum?id=rkgCJ64tDB\nWould you care to make a comparison between these two manuscript?"}
