Experiments showed that the sub-leading approximation formula approximates the generalization error well when $n$ is large. \n\n\nThis paper is poorly written. Many mathematic notations and terminologies are not well-defined. The setup of the experiments are not given clearly. Here I gave some examples: \n1) The authors claimed that they derived two approximation formulas, EK and SL. I didn't find a clear statement in the main text saying which formula is the EK approximation and which formula is the SL approximation. My conjecture is that, Eq. (10) gives the EK formula, and SL formula is not given in the main text. In addition, Eq. (10) is confusing because the authors wrote that Eq. (10) is a simplification of Eq. (8). However, Eq. (8) was an approximate equality, then Eq. (10) turned into an equality. \n2) Figure 1 gives experimental results. However, the description of the experimental setup is completely vague. The authors described the kernel and the target function as \"the NTK kernel implied by a fully connected network of depth 4 with $\u03c3_w^2 = \u03c3_b^2 = 1$ and ReLU activations\" and \"a target function with equal spectral weights at $l = 1, 2$\", without other explanations. I don't think readers can figure out what is exactly the kernel and the target function from this description. \n3) I am concerned about the writing style of this paper. I am OK with the physics jargon the authors used in the paper, as well as the non-rigorous of the result. But I think the authors should write equations in a clear way. For example, the definition of renormalized NTK should better be defined in equations such as $K_r(x, x') = \\sum_{k = 0}^r b_k <x, x'>^k$, rather than be described in words like \"trim after the r\u2019th power\". \n\n\nHere is a technical question: \n- It seems that the authors claimed that both EK and SL give approximation error O(1/N^3). Then why SL is the \"sub-leading asymptotics\"? \n\n\nI feel the content of the paper is somewhat interesting. However, the paper is poorly written. The authors failed to deliver effective scientific communication to the readers. The results cannot be reproduced after reading this paper. Therefore, I would give a clear reject. "}
