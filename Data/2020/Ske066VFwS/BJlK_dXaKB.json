The system is also extended to use a hierarchical structure based on the ladder network, motivated by theoretical ideas of how brain structures work.  Empirical results show that the system can potentially do better than a two-stage strategy where the popular package Oasis is first run on the calcium imaging data to extract spike trains, which is the typical import to LFADS.\n\nFirst, I disagree with the claim that OASIS+LFADS cannot reconstruct the calcium imaging trace.  In fact, OASIS is a deconvolutional model; if the spike train is predicted, then it is straightforward to predict the corresponding calcium trace based upon the autoregressive model using in OASIS.  Therefore, it is not clear that the Ladder LFADS that directly using fluorescence data is, in fact, better than this two stage procedure, nor does it really have a benefit on predicting all data types.  Can the authors please clarify if the proposed strategy works improves reconstruction of the calcium trace?\n\nSecond, I think that the experiments need significantly more exploration of uncertainty, reproducibility, and robustness.  The  R^2 values differ massively between methods; this needs to be explained more clearly as to why these large differences exist between relatively similar methods, and how these systems hold up to repeats.  Are the results in the table statistically significant?  What is the uncertainty? Why do these large differences exist?\n\nThe authors really should elaborate on why the ladder network is beneficial.  There is a nice motivation for using a hierarchical structure in the introduction, but it is unclear if there is real benefit to this structure and how it could be used to help answer scientific questions, as is ostensibly the goal of this manuscript.  Can the authors please describe how this modification will help answer a scientific question?\n\nFinally, the modeling details in this paper is not self-contained and are difficult to follow.  The model introduction section needs to be rewritten for clarity and actually introduce the methodology in a somewhat self-contained manner. A better description of LFADS and DeepSpike is necessary.\n\nWhile I think there are too many issues to support acceptance of this manuscript, especially on the significance and utility of the results and method, it would be exciting if the approach could actually be used to extract and utilize a broad variety of dendritic shapes."}
