State-of-the-art performance is achieved on several datasets.  However, there are still details and concerns.\n\n1. The paper should also talk about the details of ARNet and discuss the difference, as I assume they are the most related work \n2. during sampling, either training or testing, how do authors handle temporal overlap or make it overlap?\n3. can you provide the training memory, inference speed, and total training time?\n4. Most importantly, for table4, authors are comparing to the ResNet18 ARNet instead of ResNet50? which is better than the proposed method.\n5. lack of related work:  4D Spatio-Temporal ConvNets: Minkowski Convolutional Neural Networks, CVPR 2019.\n\n"}
