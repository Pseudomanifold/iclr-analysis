In the introduction, the paper motivates by pointing out the limitation of neural networks, which is memorization based and they want to generalize by understanding the inherent rules. However, if you look at the way the fundamental building blocks are designed, and how the multiplication model works, the rules are injected based on human knowledge, e.g., the way signal digit multiplication extends to multi-digit multiplication, there is simply no understanding by the model itself. Besides, the whole process has no training, i.e., the weights of the small networks are fixed, and what is the trainable parts? \n\nThe whole paper has many spelling and grammar errors, which hinders the reading. And the writing needs to be significantly improved. "}
