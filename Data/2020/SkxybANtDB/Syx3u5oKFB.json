I talked to the PC about it, and the PC asked me to continue reviewing this paper. So I tried to understand this paper, and I found it is difficult for me. I am not sure if the writing is not good or for some other reasons. I read Section 2.1, and I thought the following description would discuss how to solve \\phi(t). Unfortunately, I did not find where \\phi(t) is mentioned in Section 2.2. Maybe, I misunderstood Section 2.2. \n\nI do not know how to rate this paper. To avoid killing a good paper, I rated this paper as Weak Accept, and leave the decision to other reviewers and the AC."}
