The paper proposes to use master game tree (which is MCTS as well) to control the generation of episodes when solving a game using MCTS.\nThis is a clear case of less than half-baked paper. The paper does not cite any previous research (no references) and is poorly written. I believe this is sufficient ground for not recommending accept. I would suggest the authors to re-submit when the paper is complete, maybe, start with related work and references."}
