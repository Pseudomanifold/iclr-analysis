The paper is very poorly written, with many incomprehensible passages. Moreover there are no references at all. It does not appear to be a serious academic endeavor, merely a set of notes. There are many mathematical symbols not defined, much of the paper consists of blank space yet it goes up to 10 pages, the algorithm boxes are very difficult to follow, the writing is so poor that I cannot decipher what the intent even was. A significant amount of work would be required to make this acceptable for publication in any venue."}
