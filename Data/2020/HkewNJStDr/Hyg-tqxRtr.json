The key idea is to introduce BCD into SVRG type of algorithm to speed up the convergence as well as the hard thresholding operation. The paper is well written and easy to follow. The theoretical analysis is strong, I think. However, my main concern of the paper is the experimental part.\n\n1. The test functions are simple (i.e. logistic and linear regression), and the data sets are simple as well. I'd like to see more experiments using more complex problems with more realistic data. \n\n2. There are two stronger assumptions in the paper, but they are never verified in the experiments. What else functions are following such functions? Any example?\n\n3. There are no validation experiments for Thm. 1. Are all the assumptions mild in practice? Is it possible to plot the upper bound in Eq. 4?\n\n4. I do not understand the usage of Def. 1.\n"}
