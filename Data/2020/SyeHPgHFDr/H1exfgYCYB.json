The pruning method is evaluated on XOR-like datasets as well as real-world datasets. \n\nThe use of an XOR-like dataset to study loss landscapes is interesting, making for a controlled and analyzable setting to carry out the study. The way the authors set it up, the XOR-like problem involves nuisance variables that naturally introduce suboptimal local minima into the loss landscape (this is my observation as a reviewer -- I am not sure if the authors were aware of this). I am unsure if Section 2 of the paper was intended as a core contribution or as a motivation for the pruning algorithm proposed in Section 3. Given the set-up\u2019s simplicity, a short theoretical argument (maybe even a theorem) about the quality and number of local minima one would expect to find could have been more concise and compelling than the empirical analysis from the paper. The findings from Section 2 may not be surprising enough to warrant two full pages. \n\nSection 3 proposes a network pruning method to find better local minima. The authors cite a paper by Adrian Barbu as the inspiration for their pruning algorithm with annealing, and use it \u201cto improve the capability of NNs to find a deep local minimum even when there are irrelevant variables\u201d. The cited paper by Barbu as well as https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.01930.pdf (also by Adrian Barbu, not cited, maybe because it appeared) explore feature selection and regularization with (nearly) the same annealed pruning algorithm in some detail. I would be grateful if the authors could highlight the differences between their work and Barbu\u2019s. \n\nI vote to \u201cweak reject\u201d this paper. The paper discusses interesting ideas, but other ICLR submissions present deeper and more novel material, and there appears to be some (unintentional, I believe) overlap with already-published work. I recommend that the authors cite and discuss https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.01930.pdf , and possibly submit the paper at a less competitive conference. \n\n\nFurther comments / questions / advice\n=================================\n\n- It would be helpful if the authors made more clear what they consider the key contributions of their paper. If contributions build directly on earlier work, it\u2019s helpful to highlight the differences. \n\n- Section 4.2 states that datasets were \u201ccarefully selected\u201d in what sounds like a case-by-case basis, probably with the goal of finding data sets on which CPNA outperforms networks trained with vanilla gradient descent methods. This process would have selection bias and surface data sets on which CPNA outperforms. I could be grateful if the authors could clarify if this was indeed the process, or if a less biased criterion was used. For example, one could have chosen data sets on which a 1-layer fully connected neural network achieves between 50% and 90% F-1. \n\n- A reader of the paper might wonder for what data sets they should use CPNA in order to train network that achieves low out-of-sample loss. I could be grateful if the authors could comment on this. Following up on the previous point: it would be great the authors could include data sets where CPNA does not outperform. \n\n- Could the authors include information on how long training takes for the experiments from Table 3? \n\n- https://openreview.net/pdf?id=HkghWScuoQ should probably be cited\n\n- https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.01930.pdf should definitely be cited"}
