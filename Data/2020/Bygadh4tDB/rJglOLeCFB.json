Previous concerns on clarity has been addressed and the paper is now more readable. Though I still believe that the boolean analysis part is unnecessary for deriving the final estimator (which can be easily derived from the exact local-expectation estimator E_p[f(z_i=1) - f(z_i=0)] and applying f(1) - f(0) = \\int_0^1 f'(x) dx \\approx f(e), e~Unif[0,1].) plus some importance sampling trick.\n\nI think the proof of Lemma 3 is incorrect (though the conclusion is correct). f is never multi-linear in the continuous space. It is only for the boolean space, that f has an multi-linear form with Fourier expansion. So the claim that f is multi-linear then\n\nE_{p(z}}[f(z_1, ..., z_n)] = f(\\mu_1, ..., \\mu_n)\n\nis incorrect. This can only be true when f is also linear in the continuous space (which is not true for typical vaes).\n\n"}
