Weight normalization re-parameterizes the weights to decouple the directions and lengths of kernels. Depending on the lengths of kernels the training process can be divided into two regimes, corresponding to updates of lengths and directions, respectively. One of the regimes naturally corresponds to lazy training where the directions remain stable. And there are transitions from one regime to the other when the lengths gradually change during the training process.\n\nThe proofs are very solid and the results look strong to me.\n\nMy only concern is that this paper is obviously squeezed to fit into 8 pages. I am not sure whether this is acceptable. Personally I think there is no need to do so and it's okay to just use 10 pages based on the loaded contents of this paper."}
