The idea is to model the hierarchical structure in the decision space, thus tree search idea can be applied to improve the efficiency of learning.\n\nIn general the trend of the paper is easy to follow. However, the proposed method is a bit ad-hoc and I don\u2019t think the paper provides enough justification for it. \n1. FPF is not really practical in that it needs to main D! decision trees, each one with N^D leaves. On the other hand, other approximation methods like PPF, relies on some independence assumption. However, this paper provides not analysis about such independence even in simulations. For example, when these independence assumptions are strongly violated, what the performances would be.\n2. There is no experiments on real data. The simulation in the this paper is very specific and I am not sure how representative it could be. The simulation results don\u2019t provide a clear message too.\n\nOther comment\n1. On page 4, why would P(f_{d1:d_D}) be propotional to P(f_{d1:d_i})? "}
