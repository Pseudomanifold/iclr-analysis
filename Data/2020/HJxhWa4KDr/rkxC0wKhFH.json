In particular:\n- formulation is the same (even use of MMD_u is copied, while not being defined before),\n- main proof of Theorem 2 (p.25-26) is the proof of Corollary 3 of [1] followed by the proof of Theorem 5 of [1],\n- Lemma 13 is Lemma 3 of [1],\n- Definition 3 in Appendix B.2 is the same as Assumption D of [1] (Appendix C.2),\n- Proposition 4 and it's proof (p. 21) are the same as Lemma 2 of [1].\n\n[1] Miko\u0142aj Bi\u0144kowski, Dougal J.
