The experiments are conducted on CIFAR-10, CelebA and LSUN datasets. \n\nThe method is not novel. Both MMD GAN and the random-forest kernel have been well explored. Combining them together is considered as an extension. For the theory, the paper only provides the unbiasedness analysis. It is not clear to me whether this kernel is better than other MMD GAN variations. It is not clear how the claimed flexibility comes from. \n\nRegarding the experiments, it only compares with very basic baselines and the results are not significantly better. It would be better to include stronger baselines (Wang et al., 2019, Binkowski et al., 2018).\n\nThe writing of the paper is poor. with several typos. Moreover, as mentioned by reviewer #1,  theorem 2 and its proof are plagiarised. \n\nOverall, I think the paper is a clear reject. "}
