The general idea is to use gradients of some distance function to define the vector field. The authors use voxelization to approximate the point cloud in a narrow-band covering the point cloud so that distance function can be calculated. The authors also discuss how to compute the distance function and the vector fields on point clouds. Experimental results on classification tasks and segmentation tasks are provided. \n\n\nI am not an expert on this topic and do not have enough expertise to judge the theoretical novelty of this paper (and thus my low confidence). However, I believe the writing can be significantly improved by making the introduction part more friendly to readers unfamiliar with differential geometry. "}
