The main challenge is that expressing all metric constraints on n points requiries O(n^3) constraints. The paper proposes a \u201cproject and forget\u201d approach which is essentially is based on cyclic Bregman projections but with a twist that some of the constraints are forgotten. The proof of convergence of this method is given, but no explicit bound on the number of iterations. While the general method doesn\u2019t appear to be particularly novel, I found it quite impressive that the authors were able to solve 10x larger instances of weighted correlation clustering than the previous work. While from a theoretical perspective this work is hardly very exciting, the practical results are rather interesting. Other applications to the metric nearness and metric learning problems are also given. \n\n\nComments:\n-- The paper is full of typos and needs to be proofread by a native English speaker.\n"}
