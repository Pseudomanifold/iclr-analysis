The energy formulations for U\u03b8, namely an autoencoder and Gibbs model, are not to my knowledge new in this context. I gather the novelty must then be in Section 3.2, which uses a neural-network based interpolation scheme. This builds on an existing update scheme (Equation 8), but replaces the full operator \u03c8 with an iterative update. The key idea is then to replace the full gradient for the energy function with a learned function, based on a CNN. While this is not my area of expertise, I am not sure as to technical significance or novelty of such a proposal.\n\nThe paper emphasises their view of an interpolation operator I, which is a little confusing in an autoencoder context. Typically, we pick \\hat{X} to be the solution attaining minimal squared error compared to the reference Y. It was not clear why one needs a further invocation of a minimisation between Y^i and I(U\u03b8, Y^i, \u03a9^i).\n\nThe writing could be improved, as there are a number of grammatical issues, as well as missing section or equation #'s. In terms of presentation, the Introduction delves far too soon into a detailed discussion of related work in the area. I would suggest instead to provide a crisp high-level overview of the limitations of existing work, and how they are overcome in the present paper."}
