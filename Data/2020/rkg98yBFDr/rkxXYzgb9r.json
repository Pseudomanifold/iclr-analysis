A reject option could be useful in prediction problems to handle Out-of-distribution examples. The classification procedure studied in this paper builds on three components 1. An auto-encoder that obtains a latent low-dimensional representation of the data point 2.  A generative model that models the class-conditional probability model and 3.  a margin based loss function that learns a classifier that provides a large probability mass to the class-conditional distribution corresponding to the correct class.  The final decision procedure is to reject an input if the best class conditional probability is small and to use the class corresponding to the best class conditional probability otherwise. \n\nOn the whole I like the paper and think that the problem tackles an important problem. I have a few comments\n1. I would like to see what is the log-likelihood assigned by the proposed procedure on OOD samples and would like to see a comparison of the log-likelihood assigned by other procedures."}
