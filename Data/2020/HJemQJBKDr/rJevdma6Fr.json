The formulation of the CDRE Eq.(5)is quite intuitive, and it makes sense. Then, a log-linear model is employed for a density-ratio model, and it is estimated by using a density-ratio estimation algorithm. Through experiments, the authors show that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing methods.\n\nThe paper is clearly written and easy to read. The density-ratio estimation algorithm for continual learning is new and interesting.\n\nDetailed comments:\n1. I am pretty new to the continual learning. The formulation of CDRE is interesting. However, I am still not that certain whether the setup is realistic. In the introduction, authors describe that we cannot obtain data points due to privacy or limited cost budget. More specifically, if it is a privacy issue, we may not be able to use the model trained by the private data as well. Also, could you give me a couple of examples of the limited cost budget case?\n\n2. In this paper, authors employed the log-linear model. If we use another model, performance can be changed?\n\n"}
