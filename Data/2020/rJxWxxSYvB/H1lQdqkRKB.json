Earlier work for feedback alignment has included methods such as hard-coding sign symmetry. In this method, the authors show that a piece-wise linear model of the feedback as a function of the input given to a neuron can estimate the causal effect of a spike on downstream neurons. The authors propose a learning rule based on regression discontinuity design (RDD) and show that this leads to stronger alignment of weights (especially in earlier layers) compared to previous methods. The causal effect is measured directly from the discontinuity introduced while spiking - the difference between the outputs of the estimated piece-wise linear model at the point of discontinuity is used as the feedback.\n\nCompared to feedback alignment, RDD-based pre-training demonstrates stronger alignment between forward and backward weights and better performance on CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST datasets. Overall, the paper is very well written and addresses an important problem. The theoretical foundation, to my knowledge, is well studied."}
