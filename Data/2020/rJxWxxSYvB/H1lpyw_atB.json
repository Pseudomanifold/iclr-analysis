This paper proposes a novel learning method for the feedback weights which depends on accurately estimating the causal effect of any spiking neuron on the other neurons deeper in the network. Additionally, they show that this method also minimizes a natural cost function. They run many experiments on FashionMNIST and CIFAR-10 to validate this and also show that for deeper networks this approaches the accuracy levels of GD-based algorithms. \n\n\n\ncomments\n\nOverall I find this paper to be well-written and _accessible_ to someone who is not familiar with the biologically plausible learning algorithms. To overcome the massive computational burden, they employ a novel experimental setup. In particular, they use a separate non-spiking neural network to train the feedforward weights and use the spiking neurons only for alignment of weights. They have experimental evidence to show that this method is a legitimate workaround. I find their experimental setup and the results convincing to the best of my knowledge. The experimental results indeed show the claim that the proposed algorithm has the properties stated earlier (i.e., learns the feedback weights correctly and that using this to train deep neural nets provide better performance than weight alignment procedure). I must warn that I am not an expert in this area and thus, might miss some subtleties. Given this, it is also unclear to me why this problem is important and thus, would leave the judgement of this to other reviewers. Here I will score only based on the technical merit of the method used to solve the problem.\n\nI had one minor comment on the arrangement of the writing of the paper. Section 4 starts off with \"Results\" but the earlier sub-sections are not really about the results. I would split section 4 as methodology/algorithm and include the everything until section 4.4. From sub section 4.5 onwards are the actual results.\n\n\noverall decision\n\nWithout commenting on the importance of this problem, I think this paper merits an acceptance based on the technical content. The paper provides convincing experiments to test the properties the author claim the new algorithm has."}
