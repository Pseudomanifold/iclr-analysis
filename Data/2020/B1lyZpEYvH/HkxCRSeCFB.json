This is obviously useful, but in addition to having a smaller total model they show that they also have (slightly) better prediction AND AT THE SAME TIME \"better\" explanations (which is always hard to evaluate).\n\nThis is a useful paper, and I can clearly see it used. However, it might not get many ICLR attendants excited.\n\nI found the paper very hard to read, having to re-read many parts to understand exactly what is the goal of each section. The row names of the table 1-3 do not correspond to the names in the text which makes the understanding even harder. Also, I think that some plot that shows accuracy vs \"interpretability\", with model size as a third dimension (eg surface of the bubble) would convey the take-home of the paper much clearer than the many tables with small differences between them.\n\nA minor comment: the SVM has a huge parameter space, which is weird. Are you using *all* bigrams? A fairer comparison would be to use more n-grams, but keep only the most frequent ones."}
