The authors propose an architecture that incorporates classic principles from SfM, namely depth computation based on cost volumes and motion estimation based on the reprojection error of features. Extensive experiments on a variety of datasets are shown and support that this approach provides strong results.\n\n+ Principled approach that marries the best aspects of deep learning with classic principles from multi-view geometry.\n\n+ Well-written paper\n\n+ Generalizes well\n\n+ Significantly outperforms the state of the art\n\n+ Clearly shows that more views help\n\n+ Seems to be robust to initialization\n\n\nQuestion: What happens if more Gauss-Newton steps are made? Could one trade computation for quality here?\n\n\nMinor issues:\n\n- Equation (1), right: f_z should probably be f_x\n- Paragraph between Eq. (1) and (2): There seems to be something wrong with the typesetting of x^i=... (e.g. the equals sign)\n- Same for the paragraph before Eq. (1) and x=(u,v)\n\n\nSummary: This paper presents a well-engineered and non-trivial system that leverages principles from different fields in a very reasonable way. The results look great both qualitatively and quantitatively. The experiments are extensive and show a clear improvement over the state-of-the-art.\n"}
