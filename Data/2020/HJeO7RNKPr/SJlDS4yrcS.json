In the model, the pipeline iteratively estimates motion and depth by separate modules, which can be trained in an end-to-end fashion. The numerical results show better scores than the other SOTA methods.  Overall, I think this is a useful work and may be considered for publishing.\n\nThe following are the detailed comments:\n1. The introduction of the related works is well written.\n2. The empirical comparison is quite thorough and demonstrates the proposed method using sequence and multi-frame is very useful.\n3. The method has good generalization.\n\n4. Besides the empirical results, I found the paper reads quite mechanical and provides very limited understanding if any. It would be much better if the authors can make further effort to understand where exactly the performance comes from. With a more complete story, the paper would have a better potential to last longer."}
