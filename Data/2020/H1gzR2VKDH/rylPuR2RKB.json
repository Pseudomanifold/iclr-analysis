It first generates the subgoals conditioned on the main goal. These subgoals are optimized to have meaningful states and used for planning. The experiments on Maze navigation, simulated desk manipulation, and real robot manipulation show significant performance gain over the planning method without subgoals and model-free RL. \n\nThe paper tackles a novel and challenging problem for the long-horizon tasks. Also, the paper is well written and easy to understand.\n\nQuestions/Concerns:\n\n- How important is the output quality of the video prediction model? \n\n- Finding subgoals that split into the optimal subtasks seems not easy. Are the learned subgoals actually reasonable for the final task? I can see that Fig. 6 has some examples of subgoals but is hard to recognize what are the subtasks. \n- Also, is there a chance that subgoals are randomly selected? Could you verify that subgoals are consistent across different initialization/runs? \n- Could you provide us any failure cases if there's any and explain us why this happens? \n\n- The number of subgoals needs to be fixed. I assume this number depends on how complex of the task is. It is surprising that only 2 subgoals were enough for the BAIR Robot push dataset (Tab. 1). The authors commented that \"the sampling budget allocated for subgoal optimization is likely insufficient to find a large sequence of subgoals.\". Will it actually be solved by increasing the sampling? Or is it possible that the dataset is too simple or simply finding optimal subgoals is hard.  Could authors comment more about this issue?\n- Also, how can you find the right number of subgoals? \n\n- The computational requirement is one of the weaknesses. Please provide the comparison of how much is the computational cost of the proposed method compared to other ones such as VF (without subgaols), TAP, and RIG. \n"}
