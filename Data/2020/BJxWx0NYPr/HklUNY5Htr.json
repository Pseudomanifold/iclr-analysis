This is done by computing for each node a value for each other node within its receptive field, calculated based on some distance metric from the node (either a Gaussian decay profile, or a learned weighting of number of hops distance, of based on fixed point of a random walk with restart). When evaluating the attention between two nodes, a function that compares the structural values between the two nodes (based on Jacard similarity) gives a score to the two nodes, which is further used for calculating the attention weight between them.\n\nI found the idea to be elegant and well-explained, and overall the paper is well-written. \nUsing the structural similarity makes a lot of sense, and the proposed method is both easy to implement, and flexible \u2014 the structural similarity profile can be learned, which seems important for getting this idea to work in practice.\n\nI wonder what happens if one uses only the structural similarity for the attention (without the feature similarity). Are there datasets where this would be sufficient? Even a toy task which is constructed such that the structure is more informative than the features could be a nice way to further demonstrate the idea of the paper.\n\nThe experiments show a clear yet small advantage to the proposed method over the conventional attention method (GAT).\n\nOverall, this seems to be a solid contribution (even if the empirical results are a bit incremental) and I recommend acceptance."}
