Especially, considering the instability in perturbation-based private algorithms, e.g., most DP ones, the work could be valuable in the sense of practice.\n\nWeakness:\nAs far as empirical research, the compared techniques are too few. What if we use those less popular techniques, for example, RMSprop optimization method?\n\nThe model capacity of neural networks, especially deep networks, has some non-trivial relation to the number of filters or the number parameters. It is important to quantify such relation. A good reference might be [A]. Briefly, the generalization performance may not be monotonic against the number of parameters.\n\nThe baselines are not enough. Of course, Abadi et al.\u2019s work is outstanding in handling the privacy learning of deep networks. It has been further developed by the following researchers. For example, [B] and [C]. Does the conclusion still hold for these algorithms?\n\n[A] Neyshabur, B., Bhojanapalli, S., Mcallester, D., & Srebro, N. (2017). Exploring Generalization in Deep Learning. In I. Guyon, U. V.
