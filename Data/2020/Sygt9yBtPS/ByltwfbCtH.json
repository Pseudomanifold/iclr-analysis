This module is trained to estimate paragraph vector given visual features from each region. Estimated paragraph vectors are concatenated to the visual features and used to generate the paragraph. Experimental results show that the combination of TEB and the existing methods outperforms the baselines.\n\nMy first concern is that the related papers are not cited:\n- Chatterjee and Schwing, Diverse and Coherent Paragraph Generation from Images. ECCV, 2018.\n- Wang et al., Convolutional Auto-encoding of Sentence Topics for Image Paragraph Generation. IJCAI, 2019.\n\nThe second concern is that the performance gain is not so convincing. While the Diversity model [Melas-Kyriazi+, EMNLP 2018] improves its CIDEr score with about eight points, the use of the TEB module improves it with about just one point. Additionally, I would like to recommend that an experiment on Amazon Dataset should be done as reported in [Chatterjee+Schwing, ECCV 2018] to show versatility.\n\nFinally, the explanations about the proposed method and the experimental results should be improved and detailed. For example, the description of Fig. 1 is finished using just a single sentence in the main text. There are no ablation studies using different hyperparameters such as a weight applied to the TEB', the sliding window size, and the sampling threshold for TEB. \n\nOverall, the presentation quality of the paper should be revised before being accepted in ICLR."}
