It seems this manuscript is written in a rush, where the method section barely introduces the idea, and the experiment section miss important evaluation. \n\nIt seems the authors try to use the objective in Eq.(1) to learn word embeddings. It is unknown how to learn paragraph embeddings similarly. It is confusing to learn paragraph embeddings. For example, the size of word vocabulary is limited, so as the size of W. However, the number of possible paragraphs is not limited, so how to maintain D? \n\nIt is also confusing how to integrate the so called TEB to existing captioning models. The manuscript only mentions the combination of TEB and transformer/diversity model using few sentences.\n\nTEB also seems an auxiliary objective on word embeddings or topic vectors (Krause 2017), instead of a new module.\n\nAs for experiments, only a single overall table and some qualitative samples are presented. Ablation studies are missing. Results analysis is missing. \n\nOverall, the idea may be good, but in current form this manuscript is not ready for publication. "}
