The figures are very coarse and the problem definition is not given very well. The paper claims that it is about continual learning, but it does not give ANY experimental results on the continual learning benchmarks. The paper seems to be dealing with an online learning with unlabeled data. \n\nCon & Questions:\n\n- Fig 3 shows the update rule, but there is no explanation on I_ref or X_1. \n- The paper says it generates random one-hot vector when queue is full, but what does it have to do with delayed feedback?\nThe algorithm requires a completely trained model and a queue that needs to store large amount of data. Then, what is the good nature of this method?\nThere is no baseline in the experimental results. \nThe T-CNN result on Cifar-10 is too low. This makes the result dubious. "}
