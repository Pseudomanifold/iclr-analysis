The key contributions are the two new pre-train objectives, (1) word structural objective, where the goal is to reconstruct the right order of intentionally shuffled word tokens, and (2) sentence structural objective, a three-class sentence-pair prediction, either the 2nd sentence precedes the 1st, the 2nd succeeds the 1st, or the 2nd is randomly selected. Unlike the original NSP (next sentence prediction) task, which is simple but tends out to be not so helpful in many downstream tasks, both proposed pre-train objectives seem to be rather useful in benchmarks tested in the paper, including GLUE, SNLI, and SQuAD. \n\nThe paper is well written and understandable for anyone who has a basic background about BERT or pre-train. The experimental results are impressive. Some of my questions / suggestions:\n\n- The two auxiliary tasks are evidently helpful. I wonder what intuition/theory leads to the selection of these two tasks? If the authors have test multiple other tasks that were not as helpful, it is also interesting to know them. \n\n- The wording of the text should be revised to reflect the up-to-date leaderboard results. Personally, I don't think the leaderboard results are that critical, but just want to make sure the writing is accurate at the time of publishing.\n\n- Please also update the results from SQuAD 1.1 CodaLab.
