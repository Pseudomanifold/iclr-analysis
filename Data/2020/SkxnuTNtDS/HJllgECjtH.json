Experimental results on a few data sets prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach. \n\nOverall, the paper is easy to follow. However, the novelty of the proposed approach is very marginal. The pooling layer is directly taken from another paper. And it is really not clear why the quadratic layer is a good approach for summarizing the node representations. The experiments are very weak as well. The proposed approach only works better on one data set and is much more worse than existing methods on the other three data sets. "}
