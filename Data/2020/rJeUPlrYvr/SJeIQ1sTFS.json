The ABN module is capable of obtain the adapted mean and variance with retraining on a small sample of data. From the experiments, it is observed that the ABN module is able to catch strong correlation on test accuracy between the evaluated model and the fine-tuned model.\nFollowing are reviewer\u2019s comments:\n1. The result is promising. The proposed evaluation method is fast and simple, achieving comparable performance on both efficiency and accuracy.\n2. What does the adapted mean and variance mean? I assume it is the domain gap (shift) between the vanilla network and the pruned network, and that is the main motivation of this work. But this point is not clarified in the manuscript.\n3. It is Figure 5 (left) rather than \u2018Figure 4.2\u2019 shows the correlation between iterations and accuracies.\n4.
