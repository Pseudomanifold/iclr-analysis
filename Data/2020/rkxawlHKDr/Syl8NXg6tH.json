The advantage of active contour methods is that some shapes (such as buildings) can naturally be represented as closed polygons, and learning to predict this representation can improve over pixelwise segmentation.\n\nThe authors propose to learn an image-level displacement field to evolve the contour, and a neural mesh renderer to render the resulting mask for comparison with the ground truth mask.  The performance compared to prior learning-based active contour methods is impressive.\n\nIn section 4.3, there\u2019s a reference to a \u201cgap in performance\u201d between the proposed method and DARNet and a reference to a \"low number of vertices,\" but a comparison between the two methods as the numbers of vertices is varied seems to only be present in Fig. 6 -- it would be interesting to see an explanation of the discrepancy for the lower number of vertices seen in this figure.\n\nOverall, due to the relative simplicity of the approach and impressive performance compared to prior learning-based approaches I recommend to accept."}
