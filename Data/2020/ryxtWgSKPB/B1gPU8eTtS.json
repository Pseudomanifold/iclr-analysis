While the content of this paper may be of interest to quantum computing specialists (I am unable to actually judge that), my impression is that it is out of scope for ICLR. Not by default, but by the style of writing and lack of effort to make the studied problem accessible to non-expert audience. After a general introduction the paper starts immediately with a physics notation for wavefunctions (ok this one could argue is still generic enough for many scientists to understand), but right after is talks of orbital angular momentum and Schmidt rank vector. I do have a background in physics, but not speciality in quantum computing, and at the end of section 2.1 I am already lost. Subsequent section are clearer but since I did not understand how is the data really represented it is impossible for me to gain insight on what is actually being done. The same is true with the evaluation as I do not know what I should be comparing to and what the standard methods give. The paper could have been a nice opening towards new applications for ICLR but it would have to be written in a much more pedestrian manner. In the present form I argue for rejection. "}
