In quantum physics experiments, one need to randomly search millions of experimental setups to search for interesting experiments. This paper shown that machine learning models can provide significant improvement over random search.\n\nIn general, this paper is easy to follow and clearly presents the main idea and verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method. However, I still have some concerns about this paper. This paper only used the machine learning method, i.e. LSTM model and binary cross entropy loss function for solving quantum physical tasks, which provides less knowledge to the machine learning or representation learning community. In my opinion, this paper should be submitted to a quantum physics journal or conference, rather than a machine learning conference."}
