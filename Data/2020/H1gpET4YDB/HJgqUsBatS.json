The authors experiment the model on multiple tasks. The model gains ~20% efficiency with ~20% decrease in memory use while maintaining comparable performance to the state of the art model. To keep the performance comparable, the authors use the same training corpus. The authors also discuss how block size could change the performance of the model. The paper is clear and well organized with good experiment results."}
