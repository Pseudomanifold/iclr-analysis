However, a few questions must be clearly addressed:\n1. Eqn 6 is derived from Eqn 2 and Eqn 5. please clean up the notation on L terms. Currently they are not consistent and L_i and L_j are not defined.\n\n2. In section 3.3, the authors mention the optimization is nontrivial. Can you expand on that? current section 3.3 is too short for the readers to appreciate that non-triviality.\n\nOther comments:\nOn Page 1, \ngrowing privacy concerns will entails \u2014> entail\nthe \"Glass / gender\" example doesn\u2019t make sense to me. why glass is considered non-private while gender is private? maybe we should use another example here.\n\nOn Page 2,\n penultimate paragraph, where it used as \u2014> where it is used as \u2026\nWhile the latter encourage preserving \u2014> encourages\nThis two additional terms \u2014> these two additional terms\n\nPage 7, Figure 2 caption needs rewriting.\n\n\n"}
