The main contribution is the observation that using a target network is necessary for achieving stable learning. I think this is an important result which seems to be validated by another ICLR submission (https://openreview.net/forum?id=SylOlp4FvH). The experimental section could definitely be improved--I was hoping to see more results on Atari or DMLab.\n\nTwo comments:\nThe V-trace equations (page 3 and 5) don't mention any clipping of the importance weights c and rho--can you clarify if this is a typo or if you don't use clipping?\nIt would be great to see experiments showing how learning curves scale with the number of workers."}
