There are two/three modules in the architecture, the R/P modules and the G module. R/P modules take the current utility estimates of the individuals in a given group comparison as input and produce the current R/P estimates for the individuals as output. The G module takes the final utility estimates of the individuals in a given group comparison as input and produces the winning probability estimate of one group preferred over the other in the given group comparison as output.\n\nI would recommend a weak accept for this paper based on the following reasons:\n* Both the R/P and G modules' input and output dimensions are independent of the number of items. This keeps the architecture scalable when facing large data sets in the real world.\n* The empirical result looks satisfactory on several data sets across different domains.\n* The theoretical foundation is sound.\n\nI would hope that the authors will make some effort in making the paper more approachable and  practical:\n* A more detailed motivation section for the architecture will make it much easier for the readers to understand.\n* A conclusion plus future work section could come in handy for future researchers."}
