The key challenge is \"consistency\" since it's hard to find the universal pattern over tasks. Instead, this paper propose to learn reward and penalty modules and both vary when the underlying model changes. Experiment results show that the proposed method consistently works the best. \n\nMy comments:\n[1] The paper is well written\n[2] This paper tries to solve an interesting problem but the application is a bit limited\n[3] It would be great to conduct ablation study, e.g., analyze efforts of different components (R, P, G)\n\n\n\n"}
