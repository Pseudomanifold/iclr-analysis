The authors demonstrate their method on a selection of RL tasks, such as an ant maze navigation task and a more complicated \u201cant fall\u201d task, which requires the agent to first move a block to fill a gap in the environment before it is able to reach the goal. \n\nI found the paper interesting and well written. My primary concern is that the primitive policies are learned independently of the composite policies, which might limit the application of this approach to more complex problems. Additionally, it would be great to also see the concurrent and sequential form of skill combination for the more complex tasks, and not just the point navigation task shown in Figure 7. \n\nStandard errors on Figures 5 and 6 seem to be missing. Additionally, I was curious that in Figure 4a and Figure 6a, the composite\u2019s performance is already a lot better than the other methods after 0 training steps. Maybe the authors can elaborate on that. Maybe the performance at step 0 is just hard to make out in the graphs?\n\nI would suggest accepting the paper but there could be a more detailed analysis of how the pre-trained sub-modules are used and learning both composite and sub-policies together would make the paper stronger. \n\nAdditional comments:\n- Where is the training graph for the Composite-SAV applied to the \u201cant fall\u201d task? Maybe I missed it?\n- Algorithm 1 should probably be moved to the main text. "}
