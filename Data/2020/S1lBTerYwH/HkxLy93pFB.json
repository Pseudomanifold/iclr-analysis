This problem is known as Zero-shot learning. The paper proposes to use adversarial methods and the hierarchical organisation of the classes to improve current models.\n\nThe paper lacks a clear description of the complete system : Figure 1 seems to be the one but there is no mention of the classification part. The description of each bloc is clear enough independently  but many question remains on the global picture. \n\nThe author should for example emphasis the fact that in their problemn the classes come with a short text  description. This is somehow unususal for a text classification problem where usually the classes are not defined by a description. In the figure, the difference of the processing of the text from the clinical document and from the class description is not clear. \n\n3.1 is related to feature extraction for the clinical document, but it is also said that this processing is also apply to class description.\n\n3.2 label encoder : if the notations were the same as on figure A, it would help understanding.\n\nResults : the claim \"our methods improve the F1 score from nearly 0 to 20.91% for the zero-shot codes\" is not true : state-of-the-art models such as Xian2018 and Felix2018 are already over 20% F1. \n \nWhen looking at Figure 3 and the analysis, WGAN-Z seem to provide better representation that WGAN with it has almost no impact on the classification results (F1 20.48 versus F1 20.30)\n\nIn conclusion, it seems that the proposed methods make the model more complex without bringing a significant improvements."}
