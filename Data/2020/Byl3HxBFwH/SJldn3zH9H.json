The adaptive selection or sampling is performed based on a hardness-aware strategy in the latent space constructed by a generative model.\nThe idea is intuitive and easy to follow. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.\nI have two questions about this work:\n1. The informative samples are fed to the training process, what about the rest \"non-informative\" ones?\n2. What is the characteristics of the selected informative samples? i.e., for a class of images, which images should be informative?"}
