In particular, they follow the framework of (Wang et al., 2018), and introduce two kinds of training regularization. The soft precision-inducing loss follows the spirit of adversarial learning, by using knowledge distillation. Additionally, a collaborative objective is introduced as middle supervision to enhance the learning capacity of hallucinator. \n\nHere are some comments:\n1. The novelty is relatively limited. The idea of hallucinating has been mainly introduced in (Wang et al., 2018). The soft precision-inducing loss is a straightforward extension of knowledge distillation (Hinton et al., 2015). \n\n2. It is not quite clear about how to use the collaborative objective on the hallucinator. Fig.2 and the text in ' Collaboration between hallucinator and learner ' (page 5) are not quite informative. Especially, how to perform the soft precision-inducing loss (l_hal^pre) for hallucinator?"}
