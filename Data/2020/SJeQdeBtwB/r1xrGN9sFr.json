The loss function is the combination of reconstruction error (L2 norm) and both discriminators (generator and decoder) loss. Once trained, the anomaly score is computed as the mean-var-normalized product of the reconstruction score and the discriminator score. The framework is adapted to timeseries by using LSTM networks for the generator and the encoder and 1D CNN for the discriminators (critics). For the calculation of the reconstruction error, the authors study three approaches: point-wise, dynamic time warping and area difference. The method is applied to two datasets (NASA Spacecraft telemetry, Yahoo traffic) and is compared to simple baselines (LSTM, ARIMA, DenseAE). The results shows an improvement over the baselines. Variations of the models are also studied (with and without critic, different similarity measures for the reconstruction errors). The results show that the discrimination score (critic) does overall provide an improvement over the reconstruction error alone. And for the reconstruction score, the area differences is best, followed by DTW and point-wise.\n\nPROS:\n\n* A somewhat novel approach to anomaly detection in timeseries is proposed that combines GAN discriminator score with a simple area-based similarity measure for the  reconstruction error.\n* A solid adaptation of CycleGAN to timeseries.\n* The simple area-based similarity measure is interesting and seems to be a good match for timeseries reconstruction as slight shifts are not penalized.\n* The paper is well written, well organized and easy to follow.\n* The technical content is sound and the math correct.\n\n\nCONS:\n\n* not really novel (CycleGAN for timeseries) nor DTW as reconstruction error. \n* no comparison to State-of-the-art GAN models for anomaly detection, such as AnoGAN and ADGAN.\n* Too few datasets are used (2) for the experiments, making it hard to draw conclusions as to which variation is better.\n* Baseline approaches are just mentioned by name. A minimal description would be desirable.\n* The ground-truth anomalies and the anomaly threshold are not marked in the plots, making it hard to evaluate them.\n\nOverall the paper proposes a method that improves over baseline but is not compared to other GAN-based SOT models. The novelty is not very high as the main architecture is from CycleGAN and the proposed similarity measures for the reconstruction error are not really novel.\n\n"}
