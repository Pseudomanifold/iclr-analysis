Actually similar method has been proposed in Hiroshi Inoue (2018) as a data augmentation method.\n\nWhat surprised me the most is that after trying to connect UMixUp with adversarial training in the whole paper, there is no evaluation of adversarial robustness in the experiments? The main character of adversarial training is an improvement in robustness and degeneration on clean accuracy, which is different from the performance of UMixup or Mixup.  \n\nThe authors should do a major modification on their motivation and experiments before the paper is able to be published.\n\nReference:\n[1] Hiroshi Inoue.
