The hierarchical prior policy is shared amongst all tasks, while the hierarchical posterior policies are allowed to adapt to specific tasks.  Once the prior is learned, it is fixed.   The parameters of the posterior policies are adjusted via an adapted version of A2C.  \n\nI liked the flow and the organization of this paper.\n\nComments and questions:\n* I see that term 1 and term 3 of equation (6) working together to ensure some kind of exploration and exploitation.  Term 2 controls how the option posterior deviates from the prior.  However, when the ratio is 1 or less than 1, the value of (6) would increase, and both cases would have made the posterior more like the prior.  There seems to be no other term that incentivizes the option posterior to deviate, and I do not see how the options are adapting to tasks.  \n\n* The term 1,2,3 in (6) are weighted equally by beta and cannot be fine-tuned to desired trade-offs.  \n\n* Should there be \\xi(i) multiplying the last term in (3)?  \n\n* What does delta(z_t - z_{t-1}) mean in section 3.1?  It was not defined anywhere.  \n\nMisspelling and typos:\n* page 5: optimized is misspelled in \"Details on how we optimiszed...\" \n\n* Appendix C.1: should there not be a superscript dash on A_{\\pi_i} since the superscript dash carries the meaning that the term is a constant.
