The combination of deep Koopman operator with graph neural nets is very novel and interesting. The experiments are also well designed and the results shown in the paper also indicate the effectiveness and efficiency of the algorithm in both simulation and control. In conclusion, I think this work can inspire more wok into modeling larger and more complex systems by integrating the power of the Koopman theory and the expressiveness of neural networks."}
