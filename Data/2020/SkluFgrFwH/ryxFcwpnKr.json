Given a set X \\subset R^d of points, sets S, D of pairs (S and D denoting similar and dissimilar pairs), numbers u, l, find a matrix G such that\n- for all pairs (p, q) \\in S: ||Gp - Gq|| \\leq u, and\n- for all pairs (p, q) \\in D: ||Gp - Gq|| \\geq l.\n\nNote that such a matrix G may not exist for a given input instance (X, S, D, u, l). So, the relevant problem is maximising the number of constraints. The paper gives an (1+\\eps)-approximation algorithm for the maximisation problem. The main idea is defining an LP-type problem and then using a previous result of Har-peled. Some experimental results for a heuristic version are given and compared against other Mahalanobis distance learning algorithms (that may or may not be defined as a maximisation problem). I think the paper ports an interesting result from LP-type problems into the context of distance learning that people may find interesting and may encourage further work.\n\nOther comments: \n1. I did not find any comment about the computational hardness of the problem. It is always good to the hardness of a problem before evaluating an approximation algorithm for the problem.\n2. It will be good to define \u201caccuracy\u201d before using it in Theorem 1.1.\n3. Did you define combinatorial dimension before using this in Lemma 2.1?\n4. What is Exact-LPTML(.) in line 6 of Algorithm 1. The function call should take two inputs.\n5. When you say that your algorithm is an FPTAS I think you are assuming that the dimension d is a constant. It will be good to make this clear.\n6. It will good to know what results for minimising the number of constraints are known from past work. The paper mentions some references. It will be much easier if the results that are known about this problem is clearly stated."}
