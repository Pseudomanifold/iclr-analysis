This topic is relevant and the paper would have more impact if its structure, presentation  and formalism could be improved. Overall it lacks clarity in the presentation of the results, the assumptions made are not always clearly stated and the split between previous work and original derivations should be improved. \n\nIn particular in section 2.1, the author should state what exactly the mean-field approximation is and at which step it is required (e.g. independence is assumed to apply the CLT but this is not clearly stated). Section 3 should also clearly state the assumptions made. That section just follows the \u201cbackground\u201d section where different works treating different cases are mentioned and it is important to restate here which cases this paper specifically considers. Aside from making assumptions clearer, it would be helpful to highlight the specific contributions of the paper so we can easily see the distinctions between straightforward adaptations of previous work and new contributions.\n\nSpecific questions:\n\nIt might be worth double checking the equation between eq. (2) and eq. (3) , the boundary case (l=0) does not make sense to me, in particular what is S^0 ?.\n\nWhat does the term hat{p}(x^l) mean in the left hand side of eq.(3)? \n\nIn eq. (7) (8) why use the definition symbol := ?\n\nAt the beginning of section 3.1, please indicate what \u201cmatcal(M)\u201d precisely refers to. Using the term P(mathcal(M) = M_ij) does not make much sense if the intent is to use a continuous distribution for the means. \n\nJust after eq. (9), please explain what Xi_{c*} means. \n\nSmall typo: Eq. (10) is introduced as \u201ccan be read from the vector equation 31\u201d, what is eq. (31)?\n\nIn section 5.2, why reducing the training set size to 25% of MNIST?\n", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I assessed the sensibility of the derivations and theory."}
