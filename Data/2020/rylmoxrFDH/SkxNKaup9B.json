In particular, they study what properties the network should have at initialisation to best train. They do so via mean field approximations in the limit of very wide networks.\n\nThe authors provide concrete advice: the mean of the stochastic weights should be close to +/-1 at initialisation. Being able to give such advice to ML practitioners is of great value, but since this advice feels counter intuitive (naively, the mean of a binary +/-1 activation is typically the output of a tanh, and initialising this close to +/-1 means that gradient are going to be roughly 0, and can easily be exactly 0 in low precision computes). Right now, the justification of this initialisation is hard to find in the paper. This point would deserve a dedicated section, giving a summary of the argument, with references to more technical parts of the paper.\n\nThe presentation should also be improved as we can find the following issues:\n* Missing letters, repeated words or even missing figures (Fig 5 and 7 in the appendix).\n* Authors need to explain what is Edge of Chaos and give some reference (for example  C. G. Langton. Computation at the edge of chaos. Physica D, 42, 1990). This will make the paper more accessible to researchers less familiar with the theory but interested in its practical applications.\n* Please, better explain figures, for example Figure 1: need to explain better what this plot is. Why are there both dotted and solid lines? What are the shaded regions: is that some confidence interval? But which one, and how many experiments were used for those plots?"}
