It builds up on highly celebrated results of Poole, Schoenholz and others, using the language of mean field theory and an approach rooted in Dynamical Systems.\nWhat the authors propose is an extension of the approach to other settings. The paper is very scientific and math-heavy. A good practice in such cases is to adhere to a format of a scientific mathematical paper and organise the material using Theorema, Lemmata, Propositions and Corollaries , Definitions and Proofs. Such language and framework exists for a reason - to structure the material and make the paper readable. The paper as is a stream of equations and discussion making it very unclear what the point is.\nIn order for this paper to be suitable for publication the reviewer would like to strongly suggest:\n- Organise the material in a way that would make it clear what is claimed, what is proven etc.\n- Make more specific what the added value of the paper is.\nAlso - for the contribution of the paper to be less incremental it would be valuable to add more formality to the original results, for example - Gaussian approximation is claimed without any sort of verification of assumptions of any version of CLT or Law of Large Numbers."}
