However, I have the following concerns:\n\n- The motivation is not clear. The advantage of the knockoff procedure is that it can find relevant features (variables) with statistical guarantees such as FDRs, which is clearly discussed in the paper.\n    However, the objective of this paper is to design a better feature selection method for prediction, where the statistical guarantee is usually not important.\n    Hence the advantage of using the knockoff procedure is not clear.\n- In addition to the above issue, the empirical performance of the proposed method is not convincing.\n    In experiments, Figure 2 shows that the proposed approach does not have significant advantage compared to existing methods.\n    It seems that this is a natural consequence as the knockoff procedure is not designed for feature selection.\n    Thus, in its current state, the advantage of the proposed approach is not well presented.\n- Also, the proposed approach is not theoretically analyzed.\n    Since the proposed method is based on the knockoff procedure, it would be interesting if there is some statistical guarantee for the selected features.\n\nMinor comments:\n- P.5, L.-4: \"SInce\" -> \"Since\"\n"}
