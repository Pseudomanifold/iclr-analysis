The approach does not seem very novel and it is hard to see what the representation learning challenges are. There is no open benchmark that the community can work on.\n\nI suggest that the paper focus on the method and not the private dataset used. If you cannot release a public dataset then maybe a synthetic dataset that presents known challenges you observe in private data. This can be used as a benchmark for the community to improve these methods. \n\nTypos:\n\n \"Step 1..Claims\"\n\nSome of the citations seem to be listing every author of the paper which is very hard to read the paper.\n"}
