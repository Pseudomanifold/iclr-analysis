To test the efficacy of their method, the authors perform the task of identifying rotamers (native side-chain configurations) from crystal structures, and compare their method to the Rosetta energy function which is the current state-of-the-art. \n\n+ Presents an important and emerging application of neural networks\n+ Relatively clearly written, e.g. giving good background on protein conformation and related things to a machine learning audience\n\n-The baselines that are compared to are set2set and Rosetta. Are there newer baselines the authors can compare to? For example, the related works section discusses some recent works.\n-I am having a hard time interpreting the numbers in the experimental results (Table 1 and Table 2). I understand that they are rotamer recovery rates and that the max would be 100%. But I can\u2019t tell what amount of difference is significant. \n-Figure 1 should have a caption clarifying notation etc. \n"}
