They combined Langevin dynamics with Stein variational gradient descent and theoretically justified that the proposed method successfully converges to the stationary distribution with only a single chain, unlike SVGD. The proposed method decreases the auto-correlation of Langevin dynamics, so the proposed method increases the sample efficiency.\n\nThe paper is well-written. The idea of the proposed method is natural, which is incorporating the functionality of SVGD to reduce the auto-correlation of Langevin dynamics. The idea is intuitive and justified by their theoretical analysis. The authors also well- placed their work in the literature, as described in Section 3. The intuitive explanation of the proposed method is given in Section 3.\n\nI have one technical question as follows. If the authors reply appropriately, I will raise the score to accept.\n\nIn Theorem 4.3, the result holds for any k and M. The authors claim that if we take a limit of M -> \u221e with fixed k, the practical dynamics converges to the discrete-time mean-field limit, in Section 4. However, to state the result of Theorem 4.3, k should be bigger than M c_\\eta from the dentition of \\tilde{\\rho}_k^M, as shown under the equation (4). How do we take a limit of M -> \u221e ? Does k also go \u221e?\n\nMinor comments:\n- The definition of g should depend on only \\theta_k^I and \\hat{\\delta}_k^M, not \\theta_k^k.\n- The equation (1) should hold for any \\theta\u2019, not \\theta.\n- The equation (1) should contain \\rho, not p."}
