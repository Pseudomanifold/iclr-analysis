The main idea is to train an independent LSTM (a Question-answer decoder) so that given the hidden state of the predictive model and a question about the environment, it is able to answer the question. \n\nThe authors give empirical evidence that the representations created by SimCore contain sufficient information for the LSTM to answer questions quite accurately while the representations created by CPC (or a vanilla LSTM) do not contain sufficient information. Based on the experimental results, the authors argue that the information encoded by SimCore contains detailed and compositional information about objects, properties and spatial relations from the physical environment.\n\nThe idea is clearly explained and seems sensible, the paper is well written, the execution is competent and the authors provide a sufficient amount of details so that reproducibility should be possible. As a result, I am positive, however, I think it would be best accepted as a workshop paper given that:\n\n- The experiment are only carried out on a single environment, however, their claims are rather general. To support such general claims, experiments on additional environments seem necessary.\n\n- While the idea is sensible, the study is quite narrow because it only compares three models.\n\n- While sensible, the methodological contribution is rather straightforward.\n\n- The take home is quite brief."}
