As the low-resolution image is small already, a network can definitely see holistic image as the receptive field is large enough to cover the whole image.\n\nIt seems contradictory to super-resolution process with the finding ``the brain generates the images we see based on a small amount of information observed by the human eye, rather than acquiring the complete data from\nthe point-by-point scan of the retina''. By reading the statement about the brain, it makes more sense that the brain does not reconstruct every details in understanding what appears in front of the eyes. However super-resolution requires finer reconstruction on the details. From this point, the first contribution is very weak.\n\nThe reference does not list the publication venues of the cited papers. This does not make the support materials strong from cited papers without the venues.\n\nThe most critical point is that the paper violate double-blind policy with the funding source, as explicitly mentioned in the acknowledgement."}
