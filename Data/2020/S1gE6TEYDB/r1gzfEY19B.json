The paper proposes two modules: GRUM (global reasoning upsample module) and GRRB (global reasoning reconstruction module), constructing a graph model based on different regions of an image and reasoning the relationships between them. This work has the potential to be a good publication, but I lean to reject this paper for now since it is not ready yet.\nStrengths\n- Doing image super resolution using graph model is novel. By building a graph with vertices of regions of an image, it is theoretically possible to address the problem of limited receptive field of CNN.\nWeaknesses\n- The designs of the two modules are not convincing. It is not clear to me why they are designed in this way. In other words, the authors stated that they are simulating the reasoning process of the human visual system, but I do not understand how GRUM and GRRB simulate the human visual system.\n- Section 3 is not reader-friendly. It is difficult to understand what is happening in these two modules by reading section 3.\n- The performance improvement is not significant. As the author listed in Table 3 and 4, the performance improvement is minor (roughly 1%?), which is not significant enough.\nPossible Improvements\nI would suggest rephrasing section 3, clearly demonstrating how the two modules simulate the human visual system (or why they are designed in this way)."}
