Specifically, the proposed method uses the previous module of RDN as the feature extraction part and attaches the proposed global reasoning upsampling module to it. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves better performance than the existing state-of-the-art methods.\n\n- The technical contribution of the proposed method (i.e. GRUM and GRRB) does not seem to be high judging from the ablation study (Section 4.2 and Table 1). The performance seems to be coming mainly from the RDN part. \n\n- It is not clear how the global reasoning upsample module (GRUM) affects the final performance. For example, this paper mentions that the benefit of this module is to dig out the influence of other pixels in the image on each region and this is equivalent to adding global guidance of the image to each node. However, what do you mean by global guidance, and how does the guidance affect the final performance on the super-resolution task? If possible, please elaborate on them and make the technical contribution of the proposed method clear."}
