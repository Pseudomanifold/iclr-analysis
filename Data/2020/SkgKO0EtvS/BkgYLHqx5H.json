Experiments are shown that the algorithm\ncan learn to visit nodes in the same order as a breadth-first-search as well\nas the Bellman-Ford shortest-path algorithm.\n\nFeedback:\n\nI'm not sure what problem this paper is trying to solve. We are provided\nthe graph and graph algorithm as input to the network so that we can\nlearn what the algorithm will do next? I'm not sure why this is a problem?\nAre these algorithms badly written and need to be improved? Do we want to\nlearn how to execute graph algorithms in general?\n\nI found the paper fairly hard to read and follow. I wish the\nmodel were described all in one place and the related work also\nin just one place. I think this paper would be greatly improved\nby more work on explaining the motivation as well as more\nclearly. I also feel the paper could be much stronger if it was grounded\nin an existing problem others in the community might have.\n\nClarifications:\n\nIn page 4, I don't know what it means to execute these two algorithms\nsimulatenously?"}
