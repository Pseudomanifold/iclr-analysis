One common challenge in this type of applications is having a high intra-class diversity and a high inter-class similarity. The solution proposed by the authors is based on the use of siamese networks to extract features from pairs of neighbouring images, and merge the features only if they are similar. The authors claim that this approach alleviate the need of a post-classification smoothing.  \n\nAdvantages: \nThe idea of merging siamese features for similar tiles only is sound. The paper is clearly written and structured. The shown results seem to outperform the baseline. \n\nDrawbacks:\nThe paper seems of fairly limited novelty. Moreover, it is centered around  one particular application. Although the task is approached with both a classification and a regression model, the classification dataset is obtained by a simple binning which makes the two tasks highly related. It would be interesting to have different settings to test the consistency of improvement with the proposed method. Finally, the authors claim that the method alleviates the need to post-classification smoothing, but this cannot be straightforwardly concluded from the conducted experiments. It would be interesting to have a more thorough comparison to other methods that use post-classification processing. ", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "N/A"}
