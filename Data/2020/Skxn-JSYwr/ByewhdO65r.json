The coupling is done with an average pooling of the feature vectors when the neighbouring patches are detected to be similar enough based on a threshold on the L2 distance of these features. The method is applied to tasks of estimating crowding population, and diseases density, from satellite images. \n\nThe paper have little novelty. The approach reduces to a smoothing method over pairs of neighbouring patches, that is only activated sometimes based on a hard threshold. This seems arbitrary and there are many competing approaches that could be applied. \nOne could think about taking all the geograpical neighbourhood of a patch into account when making a prediction, e.g. with a coarse-to-fine prediction approach; the aggregation of features can be learned and more sophisticated than average pooling. Using a single-image baseline is not fair. The discussion is not up to the level of ICLR and offers mostly guesswork."}
