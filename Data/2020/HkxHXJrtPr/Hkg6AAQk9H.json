Here they have separated the test time inference network and loss-augmented inference network (that is used for training) and added an extra term for optimizing the test-time inference network.\n\nHow this work is better than \"Learning Discriminators as Energy Networks in Adversarial Learning by Pan et al.\". It seems that they have a very similar approach, but extending the idea behind deep value networks rather than structural SVM. \n\nThe comparison here is very narrow, why you haven't tried comparing your approach with other approaches such as deep value networks ( DVNs) (Gygli et al. ,2017)? \nCould you try your approach on any task reported in DVNs' paper to have some sense of comparison?"}
