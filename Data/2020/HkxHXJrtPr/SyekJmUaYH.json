I am voting to reject this work for the lack of contributions and significance. While the overall writing is clear and well-motivated, basically the main contributions boil down to a set of minor modifications to model architecture (separating the inference network) and hacking the original objectives (Sec 4&5). On the significance side, the improvements seem incremental. Since this paper focuses on empirical efforts, stronger results are needed to make the case. \n\nMinors: It's not clear what is the motivation behind the design of the global energy term in Eqn (6). And the author(s) should try to avoid citing papers in the abstract. "}
