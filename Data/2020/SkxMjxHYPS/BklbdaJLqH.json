However, it is impossible to enumerate all possible templates and hence some good templates may not be included and studied in this paper, which makes the empirical studies in this paper less useful.\n\nIn experiments, authors need to compare with the results of neural architecture search. Based on such comparison, we can see whether the templates used in this paper are reasonable.\n\nIn experiments, it seems that different templates may have their own characteristics and their usefulness also depends on the neural network used. So it is not easy to make general conclusion."}
