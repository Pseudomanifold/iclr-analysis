The particular domain considered is of importance for biologists/medical doctors/neuroscientists: zebra fish swim bout classification.\n\nIn order to identify which particular features the neural networks are paying attention to, the paper used Deep Taylor Decomposition, which allowed the authors to identify \"clever-hans\"-type phenomena (network attending to meaningless experimental setup differences that actually gave a way the ground truth classes). This allowed for the authors to mask out such features and make the network attend to more meaningful ones. In particular observations like \" looking for salient features in the trunk of the tail while largely disregarding the tip\", are typically absent from most deep learning studies and it's quite interesting.\n\nOverall the paper is well written, the experiments are well designed; everything seems very rigorous and  well executed. It makes for a very good quality practitioner-level case study on video understanding, which may also be useful for people studying zebra fish or related simple life forms. My main concern with the paper is whether ICLR is an appropriate venue, as it does not provide pure machine learning contributions in the form of new techniques of generally applicable insights. "}
