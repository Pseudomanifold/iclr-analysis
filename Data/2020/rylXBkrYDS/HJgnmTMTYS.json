It utilizes a simple but effective approach via a transductive fine-tuning. The experimental results on several benchmarks show the improvements over state-of-the-art approaches. \n\nIt is a comprehensive study of the methods and datasets in this domain. The motivation, experimental details and result analysis are clear to me. Overall, the paper is well written and the author is very transparent to show what they have. \n\nThe only drawback of this paper is it does not provide insight/explanation. How can the simple baseline work sowell? Is this because of some bias from the datasets? I also suggest that the author can try their method on some new dataset, like Meta-Dataset (Triantafillou et al. 2019). \n\nI agreed with the author that the paper is not novel. However, I think the acceptance of the paper could benefit the community and I encourage the author can try this on some new benchmark. Therefore, I made my recommendation. "}
