The paper first propose a path-based encoding scheme to featurise the neural architectures. A path encoding of a cell is created by enumerating all possible paths from the input node to the output node. Then, they propose to train 5 neural networks and ensemble these networks to get the prediction (including the predictive value and uncertainty). The paper optimises the acquisition function via a mutation procedure, where we randomly mutate the best architectures that we have trained so far, many times, and then select the architecture from this set which minimizes the acquisition function.\n\nWhile the writing is readable and the experiments seem promising, the reviewer thinks that the novelty and contribution of the paper are limited. Particularly, using 5 neural networks for estimating the uncertainty is less convincing. This is because it would have been better if we can train a Bayesian neural network to provide the uncertainty quantification directly.\n\n\nMinor:\nPage 5: \u201crandomly randomly\u201d\n"}
