They also study which model is a better initialization model for pose estimation, and how to utilize transfer learning to get a better estimation model. \n\nThere are several questions from the paper:\n1. why are they not using human pose estimation datasets, as there are already lots of them and that will be easier to compare with other models: MPII, COCO, AI challenge, CrowdPose, etc.  I am not fully convinced the horse dataset is better than human pose. In terms of out domain, authors can use pose pre-trained models to analysis horse pose prediction.\n2. The analysis is good and with lots of experiments, however, the key part is that they do not provide a way to improve the overall performance for out-of-domain pose estimation. "}
