The data structures discussed in this paper are structured inputs (concentrating on a low-dimensional manifold) versus unstructured ones, as well as the teacher task (labels are obtained as a function of high-dimensional inputs) versus the latent task (labels are obtained as a function of the lower-dimensional latent representation of inputs). The introduced model, the hidden manifold model, which is a latent task with structured inputs, is claimed to reproduce two features found in learning of the MNIST data set, whereas the teacher task with unstructured inputs does not.\n\nThe observation that typical real-world datasets are concentrated on a lower-dimensional manifold is not novel, and it is also well expected that networks trained with such a dataset would exhibit different behaviors for inputs outside such a lower-dimensional manifold. The other observation that in real-world learning tasks one rarely encounters plateaux is not novel either. The possible novelty of this paper would thus be in the proposal of the hidden manifold model, but I am not convinced with the significance of the latent task. Because of these, I would judge possible contributions of this paper rather weak, so that I would not be able to recommend acceptance of this paper.\n\nI think that the main difference between the authors\u2019 \u201cteacher task\u201d and \u201clatent task\u201d lies in realizability of the underlying function: The teacher task is certainly realizable once the number of hidden units exceeds that of the teacher, whereas we are not sure about the realizability of the latent tasks. There might even be different levels of unrealizability which can affect learning. Anyway, the teacher versus latent distinction of learning tasks, as introduced in this paper, should be best regarded, at least in its current status, as a working hypothesis which would need more investigation. I would agree that this paper puts a step forward, but does not arrive at any decisive conclusion yet.\n\nPage 3, line 26: The assumption that g should act componentwise does not seem needed because in equation (1) it acts on a scalar.\nPage 4, line 16: there exist(s) a student network\nPage 6, line 20: gradient descent methods such (as) natural gradient descent\nPage 7, line 7: I do not understand what is meant by \u201cby dividing all entries by the covariance of the entire matrix\u201d.
