The paper is well written. A nice analysis of the proposed routing algorithm is provided. Experiments of varying the routing iterations demonstrate the stableability of proposed routing algorithm compared to others.\n\nHere are some issues:\n1. Would the authors release the code for reproducing the results in the paper? It will be helpful for future research in this area.\n\n2. In Fig.5, it would be better to give some brief explanations about why CasNet (Matrix) occupies much more memory while possessing less parameters."}
