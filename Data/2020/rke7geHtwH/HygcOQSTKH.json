To achieve this, they propose to learn a prior model and then constrain the RL policy to a trust-region that does not deviate from the domain where the current policy is close to. \n\nThe paper is clearly written.\n\nStrength: the paper is very novel and tries to solve a very challenging problem. The success of this approach shows the potential that collecting large-scale data without distinguishment is possible. With that, the data efficiency will be much improved! The experiment itself shows superior performance than other methods. This method also works for real robots.\n\nWeakness: There is no algorithm box so it can be hard to fully reproduce. The paper mentions stableness for the method however the analysis on this aspect is limited."}
