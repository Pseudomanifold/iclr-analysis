Although it is just an extension of existing works, it does outperform the-state-of-the-art methods and can be used in real-world robots.The technique details are well introduced and analysed. The experimental results and comparison are sufficient. \n\nHowever, there are also some details require further explanation. For example, In Equation (10), the Langrange multiplier should be constrained to non-negative. But the authors have not taken it into consideration in the optimization process.\nBesides, there are also some typesetting problems in the paper, such as in Fig. 7.\n"}
