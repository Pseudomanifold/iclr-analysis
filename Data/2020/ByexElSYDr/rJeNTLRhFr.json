Furthermore, a new algorithm, q-FedAvg, based on the vanilla federated learning, is proposed to solve the new optimization in massive and heterogeneous networks. The paper is well written. Theoretical analysis is also provided to support the effectiveness of the proposed methods. The experiments show good performance.\nIn overall, I think this paper solves an important problem in federated learning, and I vote for acceptance.\nHowever, since my knowledge in fairness is very limitted, I think my review is an educated guess. If the other reviews vote for rejection, I will not champion this paper.\n\nI have question to the authors:\n\nIs the proposed algorithm robust to the estimation of the Lipschitz constant? In my opinion, the proposed algorithm highly relies on $L_q(w)$. Thus, the estimation of L will be very essential. It will be better if the authors can show some results where different estimations of L  is used, and compare these results to show the sensitivity to the estimation of L."}
