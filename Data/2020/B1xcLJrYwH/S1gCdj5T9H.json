Multiple levels of granularity of the lean images (edges/edges+faces/edges+faces+depth) are compared for the learning, both in a \"memorization\" setting and in a \"generalization to unseen poses\" setting. Moreover, the behavior of the learning when labels are shuffled is evaluated.\n\nThe paper is motivated by identifying lean images with \"pure geometrical\" representation, and argues that the study is a demonstration that the network can learn some spatial map. I do not share this analysis: the edges, shapes and colors of the lean images still create some characteristic shapes that do not have to be linked with the 3D map in order to be detected; it is not clear why the detection from lean images is more geometrical in essence w.r.t. textured images. The motivation of the paper is therefore not compelling, and the study would have more relevance as an ablation study of a method using both geometry and texture. Can you give more compelling arguments for the problem setup, rather than a mere thought experiment?\n\nOther than this particular setup of geo-localizing based on lean images only, the novelty of the paper and the approach seem limited and does not offer new insights in geo-interpolation methods, geometry-aware neural networks, or memorization. Therefore, I believe the paper does not meet the standards of ICLR.\n"}
