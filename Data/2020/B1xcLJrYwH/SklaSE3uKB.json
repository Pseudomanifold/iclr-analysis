More exactly, the lean images are images rendered from a 3D model of a city. made of the depth and/or the buildings' edges and/or the buildings' faces. For the purpose of the evaluation, no real images are used,  only lean images both at training and test times. Many lean images are generated for training a network to predict the camera pose (2 translation parameters,  two angles), as a classification problem or a regression problem.\n\nThe motivation for the study is to understand the use of geometric aspects by a deep network to solve the task. However, as the paper presents mostly the results of the quantitative evaluation, it is not clear what we really learn about the mechanisms of the deep network. I think the empirical results can be interesting for people working on geo-localization, but probably not for the audience of ICLR.\n\nI suspect the authors have in mind for the future to learn to predict a lean image from a real image. I would find this aspect very interesting. It would also be interesting to evaluate the performance on the  geo-localization task when noisy images are used as input.\n"}
