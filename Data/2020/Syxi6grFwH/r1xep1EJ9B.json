Features were extracted from the data using a component analysis technique, and these features were then compared to quantities which arise during training of the DQN reinforcement learning algorithm. \n\nUnfortunately I am not well versed enough in this literature to assess the merits of this submission. However, I could not find any glaring issues, unclear sentences or any other obvious sign of incompetence. \n\nMy apologies for the inadequacy or this review (and/or the paper assignment algorithm)."}
