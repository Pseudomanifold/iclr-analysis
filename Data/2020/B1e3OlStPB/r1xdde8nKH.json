The proposed architecture is a combination of existing frameworks based on the discretization of a sphere as a graph. As a main result, the paper shows a convergence result, which is related to the rotation equivalence on a sphere. The experiments show the proposed model achieves a good tradeoff between the prediction performance and the computational cost. \n\nAlthough the theoretical result is not strong enough, the empirical results show the proposed approach is promising. Therefore I vote for acceptance. \n\nThe paper is overall clearly written. It is nice that the authors try to mitigate from overclaiming of the analysis. \n\nAs a non-expert of spherical CNN, I don't understand clearly the gap between the result Theorem 3.1 and showing the rotation equivalence. It would be nice to add some counterexample (i.e., in what situation the proposed approach does not have rotational equivalence while Theorem 3.1 holds)."}
