The authors use the existing graph CNN formulation and a pooling strategy that exploits hierarchical pixelations of the sphere to learn from the discretized sphere. The main idea is to model the discretized sphere as a graph of connected pixels: the length of the shortest path between two pixels is an approximation of the geodesic distance between them. To show the computational efficiency, sampling flexibility and rotation equivariance, extensive experiments are conducted, including 3D object recognition, cosmological mode classification, climate event segmentation and uneven sampling.\nPros:\u00a0\n1.\u00a0The application and combination of different techniques in this paper are smart.\n2. The experiments show that the proposed method outperforms other baseline methods.\n3. The paper is well organized and written.\u00a0\nCons:\n1. It is a good application of known techniques, but the novelty is limited.\n2. It is suggested to add more baselines in the experiments.\n\n[1]\u00a0Michael Defferrard, Xavier Bresson, and Pierre Vandergheynst.
