The primary goal is to develop a method that encodes equivariance to rotations, cheaply. The graph is formed by sampling the surface of the sphere and connecting neighbors according to a distance-based similarity measure. The equivariance of the representation is demonstrated empirically and theoretical background on its convergence properties are shown. DeepSphere is then demonstrated on several problems as well as shown how it applies to non-uniform data.\n\nThe paper is interesting and clear. The projection of structured data to graphical representations is both efficient in utilizing existing algorithmic techniques for graph convolutions and useful for approaching the spherical structure of the data. The theoretical analysis and discussion of sampling is interesting, though should be more clearly stated throughout and potentially visualized in figures.\n\nThe experiments performed are thorough and interesting. The approach both outperforms baselines in inference time and accuracy. However, one wonders the performance on the well-researched tasks such as the performance on 3D imagery, e.g., Su & Grauman, 2017; Coors et al., 2018. \n\nThe unevenly sampled data is a nice extension showing the generality of the approach. How does the approach work for data connected within a radius rather than a k-nearest approach?\n\nMinor:\n- A figure detailing the parameters and setup for theorem 3.1 and figure 2 would be useful.\n- The statement on the dispersion of the sampling sequence states \u201cthe smallest ball in \\R^3 containing \\sigma_i\u201d, but I believe it should be \u201ccontaining only \\sigma_i\u201d."}
