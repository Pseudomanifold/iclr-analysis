I had to re-read it several times and sketch out what exactly you are doing. I would recommend an algorithm box to summarize both the hierarchical graph partitioning *and* the learnable query network. \n\n4.3 \"additional experiments\" is some of the most interesting parts of the paper, I would recommend promoting these experimental results to the main paper.\n\nI would recommend accepting this paper because I think it may lead to state-of-the-art NNS algorithms with theoretical guarantees, especially with a more powerful query network."}
