It studies a generalized formulation with continuous state and action space and shows that the optimal value function is self-similar, fractal and non-rectifiable. That is, it cannot be described by any simple analytic formula. Based on this, it also deeply analysis the discrete case. \n\nOverall, the paper is extremely well written. I must admit that i have really enjoyed reading it. However, the discussion of the implications falls too short. There are a number of complexity results for MDPs and POMDPS, see e.g. (Papadimitriou, Tsitsiklis 1997; Lusena et al. JAIR 2001; Lee at al NIPS 2007). Indeed, the paper does not hide this and provides references. However, for an informed outsider such as the reviewer it does argue how exactly it extends our knowledge here. "}
