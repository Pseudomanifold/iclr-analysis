It presents a novel method that unifies the current classification-based approaches to overcome generalization issues and outperforms the state of the art. This work also generalizes to non-image data by extending the transformation functions to include random affine transformations. A lot of important applications of anomaly detection are based on tabular data so this is significant. The \u201cnormal\u201d data is divided into M subspaces where there are M different transformations, the idea is to then learn a feature space using triplet loss that learns supervised clusters with low intra-class variation and high inter-class variation. A score is computed (using the probabilities based on the learnt feature space) on the test samples to obtain their degree of anomalousness. The intuition behind this self-supervised approach is that learning to discriminate between many types of geometric transformations applied to normal images can help to learn cues useful for detecting novelties. \n\nPros:\n- There is an exhaustive evaluation and comparison across different types of data with the existing methods along with the SOTA. \n- It is interesting to see how random transformations indeed helped to achieve adversarial robustness.\n- The method is generalized to work on any type of data with arbitrary number of random tasks. It can even be used in a linear setting if needed for small datasets.\n\nCons:\n- While I liked that an analysis was done to see the robustness of the method on the contaminated data, I would be interested to see a more rigorous comparison in this fully unsupervised setting. \n\n\nComments/Question:\nDoes the selection of the transformation types affect the method performance at all? \n\nIn the Results section on Page 7, there are a couple of \u201c??\u201d instead of table numbers.\n"}
