And I hope to get response from the authors.\n(1) The latent space of the proposed method is not very small, it should be at least the same dimension as the input given invertibility, so it is w*h*c. What are the dimensions of resolution-preserving methods?\n(2) According to previous studies, although i-RevNet preserves all information in the latent features, it is not make robust mappings: a small perturbation on the features will ruin the inverted image. Is it still the case in CrevNet? Can we some how visualize what is happening/changing in the latent space? "}
