The authors proposed selective-activation RNN (SA-RNN), which modifies each state of RNN by adding an update coordinator which is modeled as a lightweight neural network. The coordinator, based on the incoming data, makes a discrete decision to update or not update each individual hidden dimension. A multi-objective optimization problem is defined to both solving a sequential learning task and minimizing the number of updates in each time step. The authors evaluated their networks on three public benchmark datasets and achieved good results compared to the state-of-the-art ones.\nThe papers is well-written. The idea proposed in this paper is interesting and it is presented very well. There is also an extensive evaluation.\n"}
