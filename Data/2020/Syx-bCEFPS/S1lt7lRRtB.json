But there is lack of suitable data. In this paper, the authorsestablish a large benchmark of controlled real-world noise, which is one contribution of it. For this paper, the dataset they established is a main contribution. There is no much contributions in methods. \n\nBased on the dataset and previous works, the study find something. for example, DNNS generalize much better on real-world noise, and DNNs may not learn paterns first on real-world noisy data, and so on."}
