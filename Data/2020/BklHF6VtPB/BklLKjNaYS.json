The authors further extended the model and the algorithm to an unsupervised setting where only the input representation of the samples is available.\n\nOverall I think this paper is clearly presented with some good experiment results. \n\nI have the following concerns:\n\n1)As for the supervised setting, may I know in what kind of real-world applications we can find the OPTIMAL binary and sparse output representation?  Why can we assume they are optimal?\n\n2)Is this algorithm can really work on a large scale problem? The mnist level dataset is far from giving strong evidence in claiming this point. A larger dataset like ImageNet is preferred. "}
