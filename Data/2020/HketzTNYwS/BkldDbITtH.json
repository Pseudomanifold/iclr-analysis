The extensive empirical studies presented in this paper demonstrate that the proposed method can improve the performance by a small margin across multiple datasets and tasks. Overall, I find that the idea of unifying QA, text classification and regression is interesting by itself, but the experiments cannot justify their claims well mainly due to the mixed results.   \n\nI have the following concerns:\n\n0. Compared to decalNLP (https://github.com/salesforce/decaNLP), this new approach seems unable to handle as many types of tasks as decalNLP. It is not clear to me what is the main advantage. As discussed in the Related Work Section, decalNLP needs to fix the classifier a-priori, but this submission's method needs a natural language description, which seems more difficult to implement in practice. \n1. The results are mixed. For example, SpEx-BERT underperforms BERT on RTE and QNLI in Table 2 and Span-extractive multi-task learning results in weaker single-task models as shown in Table 4a. Furthermore, an error analysis would be helpful here. "}
