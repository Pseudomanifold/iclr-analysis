They claim that HTA starts with several simplified problems and tracks the solution to the original problem via a continuous homotopy path. They give the theoretical analysis and conduct experiments on the synthetic data and the CIFAR-10 dataset. \nMy major concerns are as follows.\n1. The authors may want to give more detailed explanations of HTA. For example, they may want to give the pseudocode for HTA and explain its advantages compared to other optimization methods.\n2. The theoretical analysis is trivial. The proof of Theorem 3.1 is to verify Assumptions 4.1 and 4.3 in [1]. Moreover, the proof of Theorem 3.2 is similar to the analysis for the convergence of SGD for convex problems in [2].\n3. The experiments do not show the efficiency of HTA, as the original quasi-newton method is faster than the quasi-newton method with the homotopy setup.\n4. The authors make a mistake in the proof of Theorem 3.1. The claim that \u201c{\\theta_k} is contained in an open set which is bounded. Since that g is continuous, g is bounded.\u201d is incorrect. We can find a counterexample g(x) = \\frac{1}{x}, x\\in (0,1).\n\n[1] L. Bottou, F. Curtis, and J. Nocedal. Optimization methods for large-scale machine learning.
