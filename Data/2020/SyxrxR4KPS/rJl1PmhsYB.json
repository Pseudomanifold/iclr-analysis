As the authors note, previous work addresses \u201ccognitive flexibility\u201d (Yang et al. 2019) in isolation without motor commands, or studies motor dynamics of real mammals but without any task flexibility\u2014occluding the actual advantages that mammals have over machines. However, this work goes the full mile in requiring the agent to implement flexible cognition using a complex body in a physical environment with egocentric stimuli. From a strictly AI point of view, I could imagine arguments that this is not sufficiently \u201cnovel,\u201d in that a lot of deep RL researchers have already trained agents with complex joint structures to succeed in such virtual worlds. But the real substance of the paper is the application of data analysis techniques imported directly from neuroscience. It is important to suss out what features of neural dynamics are peculiarities of biological computation and which are natural consequences of the tasks being performed. I find the paper to be overall well motivated.\n\nThe analyses were well ordered, starting with a high-level characterization of behavior that showed a hierarchy of features, where \u201clow-level\u201d or \u201cfast\u201d features are mixed across tasks while \u201chigh-level\u201d or \u201cslow\u201d features are more task specific. They then moved on to find \u201cneural correlates\u201d at the behavior and task levels, driving home their primary point that core layers encode high-level variables in a way not shared across tasks while policy layers implement reusable core motor functions that are used in multiple contexts. This observation coincides with the measurable frequency content of core and policy activity, which is demonstrably faster in policy layers. Finally, the authors show a visualization of the dynamical systems that underlie these computations, with videos that very clearly illustrate how core and policy dynamics dissociate to specialize in cognition vs. motor generation. This part is where they really leverage the artificial setting, where the exact dynamics are known and do not need to be inferred from noisy neural data.\n\nWhile the end result of the analyses led to convincing visuals that made the intended point, the details of the analysis themselves were hard to follow and evaluate for rigor. An appendix explaining with notation how the behavioral \u201cfeatures\u201d were computed, for example, would have been helpful. I acknowledge that it is a feature of the paper that so many different analysis techniques from neuroscience\u2014dynamical systems to representation analysis to lesion studies\u2014were applied, and the sheer breadth of the analysis was impressive, if difficult to evaluate.\n\nAlthough I recognize that to do so would be difficult, I think what would add a lot to this paper would be side-by-side comparisons of real neural data with \u201cneural\u201d data from the artificial rodent. Perhaps the behavior would have to be modified so that some tasks match specific neuroscience paradigms, or the sample size for analysis limited to what is realistic for experimental data. It would be neat to see if, say, preparatory activity signals could emerge from training such an artificial rodent to do many tasks, including a head-fixed timed lever pull or some other classic paradigm. Maybe future work can draw a more exact analogy between policy/core layers and specific brain regions.\n\nAs to topic fit, this is niche in the context of ICLR; however, showing how state-of-the-art deep RL techniques can be applied to neuroscientific questions may be of interest to machine learning researchers even if they are not also neuroscientists.\n\nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed this paper and look forward to the new kinds of research that sprout out of it!"}
