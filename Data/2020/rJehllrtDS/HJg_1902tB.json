The results are that active learning doesn't really help. This paper is interesting in that it provides additional experiments for the intersection of active learning and unsupervised/semi-supervised learning. However, I don't really see the point of this paper. Active learning and unsupervised/semi-supervised learning have been combined before and there are other papers submitted to ICLR this year that combine these. The paper does not claim to provide anything new algorithmically (other than jLP which appears to work no better than random and isn't really advertised as the point of this paper). The only conclusion that I can draw is that sometimes unsupervised/semi-supervised learning works better than active learning, but no understanding of when and why this is the case (from other papers, it is not always the case).\n\n\nComments:\n\n - Although the paper claims to yield a general framework, it only does so partially. For instance, the framework in this work is restricted to semi-supervised methods that use pseudo-labels. \n\n - It may be the case that active learning doesn't help or even hurts because the batch size is too large and/or the initial seed set size is too small. Although this paper varies the acquisition strategies, these other hyper-parameters are equally, if not more, important."}
