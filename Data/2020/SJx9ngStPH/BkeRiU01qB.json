It extends on the idea of the NASBench-101 (Ying et. al., 2019) into One-Shot models. \n\nI think this is important work. With all the development of neural archictecture search methods, reproducible research is paramount. This is even more timely considering the fact that these problems are computationally expensive, so it is even more computationally difficult than usual to run exhaustive comparisons among proposed methods. \n\nThe paper is well-written and the design decisions are clearly explained. The comparison of NAS methods is also interesting to read. In general, I think this is a worthy publication. \n"}
