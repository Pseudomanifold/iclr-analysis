Previous approaches to fitting PCMCs have leveraged sequential least squares programming, making optimization unstable, the model prone to overfitting, and test-time inference difficult.  The authors propose parametrizing PCMCs with neural networks to fix these issues.  Relying on universal function approximation results, the authors show that their PCMC-Net can represent arbitrary transition matrices.  The experiments report results on a dataset of airline booking behavior, comparing PCMC-Net with four other baselines from the literature.\n\nPros:  Although I was previously unfamiliar with the PCMC model, using a neural network parametrization seems novel and well motivated.  Moreover, the airline data experiment seems to validate that PCMC-Net is indeed effective, besting the other baselines in all three metrics.  \n\nCons:  I have two main concerns over the paper\u2019s experimental rigor\u2026\n\n#1 Lack of Simulation Studies: The paper makes claims about the representation properties of PCMC-Net but fails to validate them with simulation studies.  \n\n#2 Lack of data sets: Only one experiment on one data set is reported. \n\nFinal Evaluation:  While I found the paper\u2019s methodology well motivated and sensible, the experiments do not thoroughly validate the method as they contain no simulation studies and only one data set.\n"}
