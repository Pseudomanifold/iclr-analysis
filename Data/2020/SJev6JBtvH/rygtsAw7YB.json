What is the proposal and how to evaluate it in the experiments?\n    There are also many grammatical mistakes, which also deteriorates the quality of the paper.\n- Technical quality is not high.\n    * Equations (3) and (4) are wrong. The distribution p should be not the ground truth but the empirical distribution.\n    * In experiments, only a simple Gaussian mixture model has been examined. A variety of distributions should be examined.\n    * How strong are the assumptions in Theorem 2 in practical situations?\n- There is no experimental evaluation for the proposed method. Hence the effectiveness of the proposed method is not clear.\n\nMinor comments:\n- P.2, L.3 in Section 2: \", The\" -> \", the\"\n- P.7, L.-6: \"q_1(x; \\theta_1,\" -> \"q_1(x; \\theta_1),\"\n- P.8, L.1 in Theorem 2: \"x \\in X, Consider\" -> \"x \\in X, consider\"\n"}
