The authors tackled is the problem of training machine learning models incrementally using active learning with the oracle is noisy. Multiple samples are selected instead of a unique  sample as in the classical framework. The paper seems technically sound.\n I have some suggestions for improving the quality of the paper. See below.\n\n- Improve the captions of Figures 1 and 2 (more explanation, more clarity).\n\n- Use bigger parentheses in Eq. (3).\n\n- In other to increase the impact of your work, consider in your introduction (or in the \"related works\" Section) this kind of approaches that are also active learning algorithms:\n\nD.
