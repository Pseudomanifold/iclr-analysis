The authors claim that such learning set-up prevents overfitting and reduces computational cost with respect to competitors. Finally they provide extensive results and show that outperform the state-of-the-art in multiple datasets. \n\n* The rationale behind the idea is properly introduced and justified \n* The formulation is clear and sound\n* The results show improvements over competitors in terms of accuracy and computational cost\n\n* The contributions seem very incremental. Applying GANs for data augmentation is not new and regarding the policy search the authors strongly base their approach in Cubuk19. The main differentiator wrt the work of Cubuk is to jointly train both target and policy learner in a GAN setting, rather than learning the policies a priory with a fixed target network.\n\n* I miss further discussion regarding the benefits of the GAN approach against pre-training policies. The overfitting argument seems pretty weak given the relatively marginal gains of accuracy. \n\n* It would make the experiments more complete if the Top-1 and Top-5 results were provided, as well as running experiments on the same networks as the Cubuk19 paper.\n\n* How coupled are the policies learned to the specific dataset after training?. The work by Cubuk19 shows transferability properties that could somehow diminish the gain achieved by this work regarding computational cost.\n"}
