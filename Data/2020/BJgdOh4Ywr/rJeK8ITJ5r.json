Additionally, it is not clear how impactful the proposed method can be given that it is only tested on a synthetic domain which is the same as the train domain. So, from the current experimental results it is not clear if this approach would be effective to be applied in a real system (e.g. robots) on the practical side. \n\n-There are not enough evaluation done to compare with the most updated state-of-the-art baselines. The evaluations are done on just a single synthetic domain with a single character. Therefore, the train and test videos are very similar. \n\n"}
