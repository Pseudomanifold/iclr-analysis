Technically, the author shows that the GRU is a special case of the dynamic Hopfield model. And then the author proposes three simplifications on LSTM, which are suggested by the formulation of the dynamic Hopfield model. A wide range of tasks are included in the experiment and the results prove the effectiveness of the simplification. \n\nHowever, I found it really hard to align this work with other existing works with similar or the same efforts. There has been already many works on variants of LSTM, such as SRU, fastGRNN, Clockwork RNN and etc. But none of them are employed as the baseline model, or even mentioned in the related work. Furthermore, there is not even a related work section in the paper. Therefore, this work should not be accepted.\n\n"}
