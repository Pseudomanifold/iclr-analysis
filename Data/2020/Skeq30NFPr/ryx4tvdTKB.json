Especially, the authors show that for appropriate initialization, SMO converges to a global minimum with a minimal distance to the initialization. The authors also report some experimental results to verify this theory.\n\nThe implicit regularization of SGD/SMD is widely studied in the literature. Although it is claimed that the paper improved existing results by either considering nonlinear models or identify more precise implication regularization, the contribution is a bit minor. In particular, the fundamental identity in Lemma 6 is exactly a specific case of Lemma 4 in  Azizan & Hassibi (2018) with no noises. Moreover, Azizan & Hassibi (2018) also discussed the implicit regularization of SMD in their Theorem 10 for nonlinear models with some localization arguments. This paper considers similar localization arguments with some different assumptions."}
