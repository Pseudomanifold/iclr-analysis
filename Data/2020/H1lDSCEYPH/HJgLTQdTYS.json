The proposed method employs a piece-wise linear function to transform the representation of samples from a source distribution to that of samples from the corresponding target distribution. The paper argues that the same transformation can be applied to samples from a distribution that are different from the source/target distributions. The method is empirically justified by three different tasks in computer vision and biology.\n\nIn my opinion, the motivation of the paper is clear and the writing is easy to follow, but one potential limitation is the lack of comparison with recent related work, e.g.,\n\nGenerate To Adapt: Aligning Domains using Generative Adversarial Networks\nSwami Sankaranarayanan, Yogesh Balaji, Carlos D.
