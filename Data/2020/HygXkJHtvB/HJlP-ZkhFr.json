The authors provide theoretical arguments and claim that there exists an optimal width beyond which generalization can be poor. Synthetic simulations are presented to support these claims.\n\nThe authors employ Fisher Information to characterize the optimal width or the curvature around the minimum. The fact that the determinant of the Fisher Information Matrix is invariant to parametrization, under certain conditions, serves as the motivation to design an objective Bayesian prior called Jeffrey's prior. \n\nThe motivation and the theoretical arguments are interesting, but the paper lacks in presentation and sufficient empirical evidence is also lacking to get fully convinced by the claims. \n\nThe authors should discuss the architecture design choices used for the synthetic data-generating model. Why are the last 3 layers of the larger model comprise of linear mappings?\n\nFig 1 is not clear. What does n=23 signify in the caption? More discussion is needed to describe \"intersection of the likelihood values\", \"Difference in update Step\" and \"density is placed around 0\" in section 5.\n\n\n"}
