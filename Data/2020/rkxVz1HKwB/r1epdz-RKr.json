Using the gradient (with SmoothGrad), while providing a reasonable interpretation of the model, is just a linear approximation of the true explanation of the prediction. So saying we have the correct approximation is not so useful. I also am not sure we need such a method. For example imagine a doctor is looking at a saliency map and we are sure that it is correct first order approximation because of some method. What were the negative cases where this would fail? How would this method improve that? I believe right now just the basic gradient is sufficient to indicate the region of interest.\n"}
