They study various uncertainty models such as leatoric, epistemic, vacuity and dissonance.  They study multiple uncertainty types in both\ndeep learning (DL) and belief/evidence theory domains. They treat the predictions\nof a Bayesian GNN (BGNN) as nodes\u2019 multinomial subjective opinions in a graph\nbased on Dirichlet distributions where each belief mass is a belief probability of\neach class. By collecting evidence from the given labels of training nodes, the\nBGNN model is designed for accurately predicting probabilities of each class and\ndetecting out-of-distribution. They show that their proposed Bayesian GNN outperforms state-of-the-art counterparts in terms of the accuracy of node classification prediction and out-of-distribution detection based on six real\nnetwork datasets.\n\nThe main issue with this paper is the motivation of the framework. While the technical details seem correct, the writing is unclear in many places in the manuscript. From an experimental perspective, ablation experiments need to be added. Also, the main motivation of this work is that it is modeling the uncertainty in model predictions. However, I do not see this verified anywhere experimentally.", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I assessed the sensibility of the derivations and theory."}
