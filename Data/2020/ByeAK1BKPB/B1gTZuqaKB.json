The model is based on Tucker decomposition but the core tensor is decomposed as CP decomposition so that it can be seen as an interpolation between Tucker and CP. The performance is evaluated with several NLP data sets (e.g., subject-verb-object triplets). \n\nAlthough the entire idea is interesting, the current form of the paper is not sufficient for acceptance. The main reasons are (A) the proposed model is not completely novel and (B) the empirical results are not significant. \n\n(A) The idea of combining CP and Tucker is not new. For example, Tomioka et al. (2010; Section 3.4) considered the Tucker-CP patterns (CP decomposition of the Tucker core). Although they used the Tucker-CP model to improve the interpretability rather than link prediction, the paper needs to make some attribution to the prior work. \n\n(B) By looking Figure 3, the proposed method, PComplEx, is not significantly better than the existing methods such as ComplEx. Except SVO data, PComplEx and ComplEx share almost the same performance curve. Also, other existing methods such as TuckER and MurP are evaluated only in a few points while (P)ComplEx is evaluated in many points. I feel this is unfair.\n\nTomioka, R., Hayashi, K., & Kashima, H.
