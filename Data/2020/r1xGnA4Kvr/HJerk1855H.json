The results suggest that the approach works reasonably well in many cases.\n\nSuggestions for improvement / clarification:\n- The mapping from biological sleep to the actual algorithm + pseudocode used could benefit from more thorough explanation. It is not clear which choices are arbitrary vs well-principled.\n- Was the optimal sleep duration determined empirically for each experiment?\n- I agree with the authors' proposed future work of better understanding and standardizing this approach.\n- Consider combining this approach with the existing adversarial or generalizing approaches (instead of as an alternative). Do they complement each other?"}
