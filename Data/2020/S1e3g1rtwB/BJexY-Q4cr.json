While the proposed method makes sense, I am not sure what exactly their contribution is. It is kind of clear that Pareto optimal exists, and what they did is to run the experiments multiple times with multiple \\lambda values for the Chebyshev method and plot the Pareto optimal front. \n\nPro:\nRan multiple experiments and drew the Pareto optimal front for the considered dataset. \n\nCon & Question:\nThe so-called causal fairness metric does not seem to be any more fundametal than the other proposed metrics. It seems like they worked with another metric. \nAfter defining the fairness metric, everything else seems straightforward. Just use test (validation) set to estimate the accuracy & fairness, then plot the results on the 2d plane. \nCan we identify the Pareto optimal front without running all 1500 experiments? What happens when running a model takes long to train? Then, the proposed method cannot be practical. \nFigure fonts are very small and hard to see. "}
