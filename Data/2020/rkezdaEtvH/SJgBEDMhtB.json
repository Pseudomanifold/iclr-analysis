The authors show the equivalence between the hyperbolic discount function and the temporal difference learning techniques in RL. Experimental results show the performance of the proposed method by comparing it with state-of-the-art. In general,  the text is well written and easy to follow. However,  I am not familiar with the context of hyperbolic computation.  I do not know any related works or what to expect from the results. I could not find anything wrong with this paper, but also do not have any intelligent questions to ask. Therefore, I am not sure about the technical contribution of this paper to the area. \n"}
