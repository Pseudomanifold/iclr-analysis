The paper contains some potentially interesting ideas, but the presentation quality is not sufficient for publication. The paper should be substantially improved before re-submission.\n\nStrengths:\n- Causality is an important and established research area, and papers on this topic would be timely.\n- Paper contains some interesting ideas to integrate causality into an auto-encoder (but see weaknesses below)\n- Paper proposes a new dataset for evaluating causal mechanisms (but the approach is not evaluated)\n\nWeaknesses:\n- The quality of the writing is inappropriate for a scientific venue. Language throughout the paper is loose, eg \"physics is a hot topic\" or \"People have studied causality for a long time\" or \"Causality is a bridge between science and philosophy\" The paper should be re-written so that it is precise and clear.\n- The technical approach has several typos and lacks discussion of the approach. Instead, several high-level statements are made, with long equations. This makes appreciating the contribution of the paper difficult. \n- The dataset is potentially interesting, but it is artificial. A much more exciting dataset would be realistic data.\n- The experiments only evaluate the likelihood, but it is not clear whether this is on a training or testing set. \n"}
