It aims to improve the computational complexity of the original MinHash and reduce the error of One Permutation Hashing. The proposed method is mainly assigning bins into paired bins, odd bins and even bins, and obtain two hash values, an even min and an odd min, for each bin. It finally reassigns nearby hash values to empty bins. The paper provides theoretical analyses that show the proposed method gives 1) unbiased estimator; 2) fewer empty bins 3) smaller variance. Finally the paper did some experiments on several applications including SVM and nearest neighbor search. The results show improvement over MinHash and OOPH. \n\nThe paper is mostly well written and easy to read. I have a few questions. \n\n1. My main concern is the lack of proof details. I tried to read through Proof 3.1. However, I found it is hard to follow. I'd suggest to add more details and explaination in the proof. For example, how is Eq. (17) obtained? \n\n2. The floor symbol \\lfloor, \\rfloor in Eq. (9) seems to be misused. It seems that the paper wants  $\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor$ to return the largest even integer that is less than or equal to the given value, n. Right?\n\nOverall, I vote for weak accept as the proposed is novel and the theoretical results seem reasonable to me. "}
