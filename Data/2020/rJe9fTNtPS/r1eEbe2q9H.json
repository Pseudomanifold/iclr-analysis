The idea is to use two sets of hashes (odd and even) to make more use of the data. The strategy reduces the variance of existing densification scheme. Experiments show that the proposed method gives lower MSE, good classification accuracy and better NN search performance.\n\nOverall, the idea is interesting, although the improvements will only occur in very much corner cases. The wiring can be improved. The author also use ( ) instead of [] for citations which made the paper difficult to read (among with other writing problems). The theory (and its correctness) is difficult to be justified. The authors are suggested to use plots to verify the theoretical results. \n\n"}
