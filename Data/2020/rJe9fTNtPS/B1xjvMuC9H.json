Specifically, in AHash, two steps, called Insertion and Amortization, are designed to balance the load in order to reduce the empty bins. In addition, a detailed theoretical analysis was provided. The authors evaluated the proposed AHash on three text categorization benchmarks, i.e., RCV1, NEWS20, and URL, comparing against the previous min-hashing algorithms including OOPH and MinHash. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed hashing method.  \n\nSome comments on this work are listed as follows.\n1. This paper is well motivated and structured, which may serve as a guidance for other works.\n2. Three tasks, similarity estimating, large-scale learning, and fast near neighbor searching reduction, are adopted to validate the proposed AHash. The experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve state-of-the-art performance.\n3. It seems that the effectiveness of the proposed method is OK but not surprising. The improvement of AHash over OOPH is unobtrusive, given the results shown in Table 2, Fig. 3, and Fig. 4.\n4. The authors claimed that more signi\ufb01cant performance can be achieved when the number of bins is appropriate on the task of computing similarities. Is there any theoretical guarantee for such an appropriate condition?\n5. The proposed method still cannot entirely solve the problem of empty bins, where a densifying operation may also be needed.\nMinor error:\nA typo exists in Eq. (10), where one \u201c)\u201d on the left-hand side is needless.\n\nOverall, the proposed AHash in this work is interesting and seems effective when dealing with the problem of the unbalanced load. However, there still exist quite a few issues in the current version, which need more explanations and clarifications.\n"}
