It is well written and structured, and it falls squarely within the the remit of the conference. The experimental apparatus is thorough and the derivations, proofs and the maths at large seem sound to me, even if I have not checked them in full detail. The study delivers a data-dependent variant of spectral norm regularization affecting large singular values of the DNN. It is proved to be equivalent to adversarial training based on a type of norm-constrained projected gradient ascent attack.\nResults are novel and relevant and, in my opinion, they merit acceptance."}
