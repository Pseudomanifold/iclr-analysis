Under specific conditions, in theory, the authors show the equivalence between the l2 PGD training and the regularization method. Empirical experiments are conducted to support the theory.\n\nWhile this paper gives interesting observation on both theory and empirical study, I think this paper is not qualified for publishing in ICLR due to the following reasons: (1) limited theoretical results; (2) No significant improvement for practical algorithm;\n\nMain argument:\n\nThe main theorem 1 seems to be weak as it is only valid for small perturbation region \\epsilon and it is unclear how this assumption is consistent to the practice. It is also unclear how the assumption that \\alpha \\to \\infty influences the practical algorithm.\n\nIt would be better to generalize the theorem to other \\ell_p attack, instead of just \\ell_2. \n\nDiscussion of computational complexity of the proposed regularization method compared with PGD is missed.\n\nThe adversarial robustness is related to the (local) Lipschitz continuity and many other types of regularization decreases the (local) Lipschitz constant. Could you further give result that distinguishes the proposed norm?\n\nIt would be better to give improved algorithm for adversarial training based on the current result. The current contribution for further theoretical is too weak as the main theorem requires strong assumption. And I don\u2019t see significant contribution to empirical algorithm.\n\n\nMinor\nEqu (10) seems not the typical one used and seems not the one studied later.\n"}
