To this end, the paper proposes a new architecture that utilizes modern accelerators more efficiently.  The paper reads very well and the experimental results indeed demonstrate improvement. Nevertheless, even though working in deep learning for years and have also some experience with Reinforcement learning I am not in the position to provide an expert judgment on the novelty of the work. I do not know if ICLR is the right place of the paper (I would probably suggest a system architectures conference for better assessment of the work)."}
