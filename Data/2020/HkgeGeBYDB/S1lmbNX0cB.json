Based on this, this paper proposes two metrics to quantifying the novelty of the input. Their main contribution is the NAP metric based on SVD. Their method is empirically demonstrated on several benchmark datasets, and they compare their proposed metrics with other competing methods using AUROC and experiments results are encouraging.  \n\nThe metrics proposed in this paper are intuitive and interesting. The experiments shown in Table2 is very convincing, and it could be better to extend Table3 to include other datasets (STL,OTTO, etc. )\n\n\n"}
