SAP is simply the sum of the squared norm, while NAP performs decorrelation and normalization of the magnitude.\n\nThe idea is novel, well motivated and explained.\n\nIt is said in the paper that NAP performs distance normalization by doing orthogonalization and scaling. The way it is described seems to be equivalent to PCA whitening. Thus, the computed distance should be a Mahalanobis distance.\n\nIt is not clear why for the VAE case 10 samples are averaged, instead of just using the mean component given by the encoder and passing it to decoder. It is typical to use reparametrization only during training.\n\nComparison with other state of the art methods is somewhat weak, since only two similar datasets are used (MNIST and F-MNIST)."}
