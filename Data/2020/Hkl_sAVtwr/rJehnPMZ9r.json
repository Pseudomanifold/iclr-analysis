To the best of my knowledge, the proposed method is new. The closest method, as stated by the authors, is by Bora et al. (2017). However, Bora et al. (2017) is a pre-trained method and would require access to a large number of samples. This paper, in comparison, only requires access to a small number of samples as it is an untrained generative model. \n\nThe major theoretical contribution is that by running gradient descent, for a network with single hidden layer, the training error will decrease to 0. This provides theoretical justification for early stopping adopted by the authors.\n\nMy complaint to the paper is that the theoretical justification of the generalization ability of the proposed method is missing. The error goes to 0 is not surprising by many existing works, and the authors completely ignore the generalization error analysis of the proposed method."}
