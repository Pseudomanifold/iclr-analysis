For further optimization, a learned regularization is leveraged over small training dataset.  Experimental results show that the proposed methods outperformed the others. The theoretical analysis of early stopping is also given. Overall, the writing of this paper is good, the idea is novel and the contribution is sufficient. Here are some of my comments:\n \n1.     The authors claim that CS-DIP is \"unlearned\", which makes me confusing. Although the latent representation $z$ in Eq.(2) is not learned, the weights $w$ is still learned from training over measurements. I think maybe the description is not accurate of saying that the network $G(z;w)$ is unlearned.\n \n2.  It would be better if the authors can compare CS-DIP with more deep-learning based CS methods. However, the proposed method is only compared with three traditional CS recovery method over several datasets. In Figure 4(a), only one deep-learning based method, CSGM, was compared with over MNIST dataset. More comparison should be conducted over all the datasets to demonstrate its efficiency, especially over medical image datasets."}
