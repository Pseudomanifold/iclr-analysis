The authors provide theorems and proofs to support this claim even though it is quite intuitive that smoothing with similar neighbours preserves higher variance with respect to dissimilar neighbours.\n\nIt is not straightforward to understand the limitations on the size of graphs.\n\nThe experimental analysis provides the empirical evidence of the properties of the proposed method. It is worthwhile to remark that connectivity is not necessarily helpful, like in the wiki dataset where connected nodes are not similar.\n"}
