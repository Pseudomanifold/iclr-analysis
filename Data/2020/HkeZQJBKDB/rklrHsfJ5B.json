It constructs the approximations using fully-connected deep neural networks with ReLU activations. It proves a bound on the number of parameters in the build equivariant model. The proof structure uses a decompostion of G-equivariant functions into Stab(1)-invariant functions, which are represented by a particular network. \n\nThe proof structure is reasonably well written, however more context and examples could help a reader unfamiliar with the literature. This could be achieved by proposing applications of the construction of the approximating network to a few concrete applications where equivariant representations are needed.\n\nAs-is the paper is difficult for a newcomer to the field, compared e.g. with (Maron et al. 2019b) and (Keriven & Peyr\u00e9 2019) which have clearer expositions. On the other hand, the equivariant representation problem is given in more generality, stemming from finite group actions represented by actions of permutation groups.\n\nMy current assessment is \u201cborderline\u201d and might change in light of author responses and reviews from reviewers with more experience in this field to judge the significance of the results.\n\nI think it is necessary to do a more in-depth comparison with respect to the existing work of (Keriven & Peyr\u00e9 2019).\nIn this regard, I think the following could be done:\n- Giving an application and the corresponding construction where the increased generality w.r.t. the graph networks of (Keriven & Peyr\u00e9 2019)\n- In the case of a graph network already addressed by (Keriven & Peyr\u00e9 2019) , how would this construction apply and how would the constructed network compare?\n\nWhat do the authors call \"usual models\" in the discussion of Theorem 2.3? I assume this means models that do not exploit the equivariance of the function, but this could be more explicit.\n\nTypos:\np.5, in the discussion of Theorem 2.1: \"> Then, by ... we may assume\"\np.8, Prop 4.1 Proof: n devides M\np.11: Prop A.1 Proof: can be realized as a permutation action on R^n: R should be in \\mathbb\np.17: \u201cane\u201d instead of \u201cand\u201d\n"}
