They utilized different sources of information from Wikipedia, YFCC image set and dialogue utterances. The method is very straight forward and using nearest neighbors from external information sets as auxiliary information and encoding that information via same neural net to produce the encoded external information. The concatenation of encoded input and auxiliary information is concatenated to produce the output in the dialogue via decoder network. The novelty of the proposed method is incremental over Dinan et al. (2018). The KNN-based retrieval module can produce some drift in dialogue from the actual context of the input which can result in irrelevant response in dialogue. Some failure cases can show the quality changes with those drifts in dialogues.\n"}
