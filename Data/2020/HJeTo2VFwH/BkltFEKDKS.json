Particularly, by achieving layerwise dynamical isometry with proper initialization scheme, the paper ensure the reliability of connection sensitivity pruning criteria, thereby improving the pruning results.\n\nI\u2019m inclined to reject this paper because (1) methods of dynamical isometry typically care about trainability of very deep network (e.g., 10,000 layers) and it has little to do with generalization performance which is what we really care about in network pruning; (2) experiments on signal propagation were done in small datasets and fully-connected layers without batch norm, which is not the standard setting we conduct network pruning. It\u2019s unclear whether the analysis would carry over to CNNs with batch norm.\n\nMain argument:\nThis paper attacks single-shot pruning problem from the perspective of signal propagation. By using special initialization scheme, the authors attempt to calibrate the connection sensitivity measurements across layers. The main argument in the paper of dynamical isometry doesn\u2019t has a direct connection with performance of a pruned network since it basically concerns the trainability of very deep neural networks.\n\nMoreover, adopting orthogonal initialization satisfying layerwise dynamical isometry only leads to marginal improvements over standard variance scaling initialization, as shown in Table 2 and 3.\n\nIn terms of potential improvements, I would suggest the authors to first carefully study the relationship between trainability and generalization and also analyze signal propagation of networks with batch norm. Finally, for such an empirical paper, I expect more large-scale experiments conducted.\n"}
