The authors first pointed out that a previously studied pruning criterion -- connection sensitivity (CS) -- is a normalized magnitude of gradients. Based on signal propagation theory, to achieve a 'faithful' (with minimal amplification) CS, the gradients must be also faithful. Then by using relation of Jacobians and gradient, the authors proved that orthogonally initial weights guarantees faithful on linear networks and certain distribution property on nonlinear network can achieve layerwise dynamic isometry, which is to ensure faithful signal propagation. Based on these findings, the authors proposed an initialization setup for improving pruning performance, with the goal to ensure dynamic isometry by orthogonal initialization and approximation.\n\nIn summary, this paper used a typical pruning criterion (CS) and used signal propagation theory to studied how initialization effect CS. Although this linking is quite limited, this paper has marched a step in quantitative and theoretical study of initialization in pruning: how pruning affects network performance and why it is. \n\nHere is a question:\nIn Fig.2, nonlinear activation is only shown with tanh. How is training performance when relu is used since relu is more commonly used in modern deep architectures.\n"}
