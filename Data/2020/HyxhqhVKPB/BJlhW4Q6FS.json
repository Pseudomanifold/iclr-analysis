Unlike gradient compression, the model compression in decentralized optimization is more challenging because the model parameters will not vanish like gradient. To solve this problem, the authors proposed Moniqua, where only lower-order bits of model are communicated since their higher-order bits are getting close. A hyperparameter $\\theta$ is used as a \u201ccriterion\u201d to separate the higher-order bits and lower-order bits of the model parameter via a modular arithmetic. The authors also apply Moniqua on D^2 and AD-PSGD.\n\nThere are several major concerns:\n1.\tIt is not clear how the performance is measured in this paper. If the authors simply take the average of training loss over all nodes, this is not a good evaluation unless consensus is achieved. Unless clarifying this, it is hard to judge the performance. \n2.\tIt is better to provide evaluation on the consensus error which meansures the model consistency.\n3.\tThe modular hyperparameter $\\theta$ is not easy to choose and seems cannot help achieve consensus. On the one hand, the theory suggests its value to be proportional to the gradient magnitude bound, which could be very large in practice. But if $\\theta$ is large, we cannot achieve even approximate consensus because of the quantization error. On the other hand, a small $\\theta$ cannot ensure sufficient model average since higher-order bits are ignored by the modular arithmetic but actually they should be communicated. Either way, it doesn\u2019t seem to be good for achieving consensus. \n\nOverall, the idea of Moniqua is interesting and the authors provide useful extensions based on it. But the evaluation is not convincing and whether the proposed Moniqua can achieve consensus is unclear.\n\n\n"}
