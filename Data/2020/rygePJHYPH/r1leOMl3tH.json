The idea is to introduce two additional terms, one that directly encourage lower confidence for all negative classes of all data points, and another one that optimizes the ECE for adversarial samples. Experiments show that FALCON outperforms several state-of-the-art methods for calibrating neural network predictions.\n\nAlthough the first term, L_S, affects only negative predictions, it is still somewhat strange to uniformly operate on all data points. It would help to perform an ablation study to see how L_S affect the results.\n\nSome description in Section 2 could use more mathematical rigor (e.g., when describing L_{adv}).\n\nThe authors use EDL as a baseline, I was wondering why not use the more commonly used, and possibly more effective, temperature scaling (TS) method from Guo et al. 2017. Note that the EDL paper does not seem to explicitly compare EDL and TS. \n\nFigure 4 (middle and right) is confusing. The line style is not consistent in the figures.\n\nThere are a few places where the text is rather vague and confusing. For example, what do you mean by \u2018non-misleading evidence\u2019 when describing L_{adv}? It would also be better to provide more insight more L_S to help the readers out. For example, it would help to state that L_S operate only on negative predictions.\n\nMost baselines are rather simple non-probabilistic (non-Bayesian) methods. Besides, MNF, It would also be interesting to see how FALCON compare other probabilistic NN method such as natural parameter networks, where they also explicitly evaluated uncertainty estimation.\n"}
