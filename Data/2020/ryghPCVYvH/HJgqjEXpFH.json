It is extended to multi-view generation and uncorrelated feature representation learning. \n\n- The paper is well-written and well-organized. Notations and claims are clear.\n\n- The idea of a multi-view generation model based on restricted kernel machines is interesting. However, the paper seems to be limited to model definition and algorithm overview without a performance evaluating analysis. \n\n\n- The experimental evaluations are not satisfactory. Although it is claimed in the paper that the model is able to generate high quality images, it is very hard to be confirmed with these experiments. There is no concrete attempt at comparing the performance of the model to the other used methodologies. Generating high quality images with multiple views is an interesting problem, and there are good works in the field addressing the issues. To name a few:\nZhu, Z., Luo, P., Wang, X., Tang, X.: Multi-view perceptron: a deep model for learning face identity and view representations.

Unfortunately, there is no such quantitative analysis in the paper. So the advantages of the proposed model is not very clear since there is not enough quantitative performance analysis. It would be interesting to see complexity analysis to evaluate the computational costs.\n\nOverall, I do not recommend this paper for publication. The experimental results are not satisfactory, and the paper needs improvements in that regard."}
