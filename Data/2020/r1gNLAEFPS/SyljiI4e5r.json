I think the paper makes a good methodological contribution, however I don't think that ICLR is the best conference to publish this as the topic (image rather semantic segmentation) is too narrow and in my humble opinion, it won't attract the interest of ICLR audience. Moreover, it seems to me that the saliency object detection experiment is not a very convincing one as the methods compared are a bit old (mainly from 2015-2016).  I strongly recommend the authors try to publish this at MICCAI focusing on kidney segmentation or any other related medical imaging application."}
