The paper proposes a way to represent the transitions in the replay memory as a data graph, then construct a simple MDP from it. Much more accurate Q values could be computed from the simple MDP and it provides a lower bound for the Q-values in the original problem. In this way, the method becomes less prone to soft divergence.\n\nThe idea of constructing a smaller MDP whose Q-values can be computed exactly by dynamic programming on tabular states, then use these Q-values to help dealing with the instability issues in deep RL is very interesting. In the rebuttal, I'd like the authors to address my major concern of the paper, where the proposed method seems to assume that the finite number of transitions could form a graph, which might not be always true. In typical continuous state spaces, the same state might not appear twice in the sampled transitions. In these cases, the graph becomes a number of disconnected chains and the Q-values from this MDP might not be accurate. Maybe I'm missing something, it's not very clear to me how the proposed method could be applied in the common case in deep RL where there's seldom a loop and the states are rarely visited twice. "}
