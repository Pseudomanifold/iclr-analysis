The idea is very straightforward. Basically, it used the embedding from OhmNet [Marinka et al, 2017] for the graph information and used the sequence information from UniRep [Ethan et al, 2019] or SeqVec [Michael et al, 2019]. It uses one experiment to show the performance of the combination of the two pieces of information.\n\nThis paper should be rejected for the following reasons: \n(1) The paper is obviously in the preliminary form without too much polish.\n (2) The simple combination of the results from two published articles is not that interesting\n(3) the presentation of the paper and idea is not in an acceptable form (the authors should at least draw a figure to show the big idea of the paper).\n(4) the experiment is not convincing (there is only one experiment and it is not compared with the other state-of-the-art methods; since an embedding of a protein can be of broad usage, the authors should give its performance on four tasks: protein function prediction (GO term) [Maxat et al, 2018], enzyme function prediction (EC number) [Yu et al, 2018], protein secondary structure prediction [Sheng et al, 2016], protein contact map prediction [Jinbo Xu, 2019]) \n(5) The learned embedding is not well discussed. The author should at least visualize the embeddings and check the physical and biological meaning of those embeddings, if possible. \n\nSince this manuscript would be for sure and have to be largely rewritten in the future, I would not give too many detailed suggestions but some high-level suggestions if the authors would like to refine this manuscript further and submit it somewhere else or ICLR next year:\n(1) Further improve the idea of combining different sources of information. Combining different pieces of information will definitely be helpful but the authors should figure out a way to use them in a more natural way.\n(2) Compared with other methods, which can combine different sources of information.\n(3) Run more experiments on various tasks instead of one: protein function prediction (GO term), enzyme function prediction (EC number), protein secondary structure prediction, protein contact map prediction\n(4) Refine the representation of the paper.\n\nReferences:\n[Marinka et al, 2017] Predicting multicellular function through multi-layer tissue networks, 2017, https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.04638\n[Ethan et al, 2019] Unified rational protein engineering with sequence-based deep representation learning, 2019, Nature Methods\n[Michael et al, 2019] Modeling the Language of Life \u2013 Deep Learning Protein Sequences, 2019, https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/614313v2\n[Maxat et al, 2018] DeepGO: predicting protein functions from sequence and interactions using a deep ontology-aware classifier, 2018, Bioinformatics\n[Yu et al, 2018] DEEPre: sequence-based enzyme EC number prediction by deep learning, 2018, Bioinformatics\n[Sheng et al, 2016] Protein Secondary Structure Prediction Using Deep Convolutional Neural Fields, 2016, Scientific Reports\n[Jinbo Xu, 2019] Distance-based protein folding powered by deep learning, 2019, PNAS"}
