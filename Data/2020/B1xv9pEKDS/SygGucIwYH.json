The approach, therefore, saves both memory and computation resources. \n\nThe difference to existing methods is that the authors method also performs distillation during pretraining. The authors apply their method to BERT and run experiments, comparing the distilled BERT model with the original one as well as existing distillation methods.\n\nThe experiments are extensive with impressive results. I'm torn. On the one hand, these results show that this method (which is simple and straight-forward) reduces memory and computation time (latency) substantially while maintaining similar accuracy. It can be very useful in practice. On the other hand, the idea is so simple and straight-forward, that I'm not sure ICLR (a top machine learning conference) is the right place for it. I tend to think that the paper should get accepted though since the empirical work is really exhaustive and impressive. "}
