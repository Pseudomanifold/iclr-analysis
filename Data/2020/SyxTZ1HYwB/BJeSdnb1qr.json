The authors propose a framework for sensor placement called Two-step Uncertainty Network (TUN) based on the idea of information gain maximization. More concretely, the proposed method encodes an arbitrary number of measurements, models the conditional distribution of high dimensional data, and estimates the task-specific information gain at unobserved locations. Experimental results on the synthetic data clearly show that TUN outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, such as random sampling strategy and Gaussian Process-based strategy.\n\nComments:\n- On page 1, the phrase \u201c\u2026 on high dimensional data such as images as generative models\u201d seems unclear.\n- The lhs of Eq 3. should be MI(y,x_k|v_k, Obs)?\n- In Fig. 1a, the \u201cred arrows\u201d for indicating TUM look like brown?   \n- In Fig. 1b, only the variable x_k is mentioned in the caption.\n- If I understand correctly, on page 3 in Sect. 2.1, the imagination step is basically the same as VAE? After all, there does not seem to be any discussion on the choice of variational approximation q_{\\phi} and prior p_{\\theta}(z), where is crucial for performing variational inference.\n\nThough I am not an expert in this domain, I find the basic idea is simple and easy to understand. However, my major concern is about the novelty of this work, given the fact that the theoretical contribution is quite limited."}
