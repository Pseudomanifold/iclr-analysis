The space of algorithms is parameterized by two sets of parameters which indicate the convex combinations of metrics and merge functions. They analyze the sample complexity for small generalization error. An efficient algorithm for searching an empirically optimal algorithm is proposed.\n\nComments:\n\nIn general, I think this is a good quality paper. \n- Selecting a clustering algorithm from a large space by a data-driven method is an interesting and sound idea, which makes a lot of sense to me. \n- The theorem for generalization error is strong.\n\nIt can be further improved in the following aspects (mainly the experiments).\n- The curves in Fig 3 all look smooth, so I wondered whether one can simply apply a grid search on [0.1,0.2,...,1.0], the obtained algorithm should also be very good. To demonstrate the advantage and necessity of the proposed search algorithm, I think it better to either conduct an experiment with a higher dimensional search space (instead of only searching \\alpha) or demonstrate a case when there is a sharp turn near the optimal point, so that grid search won't work well.\n- Although the authors have proved the generalization error, it is still better to empirically validate the theoretical result, by showing the training and testing errors along with varying sample sizes.\n\nOverall I like the idea and the theoretical analysis in this paper, but the experimental results could be further improved. Therefore I vote for weak acceptance.\n"}
