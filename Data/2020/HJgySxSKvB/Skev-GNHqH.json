First, feed the feature from FMs to GNNs. Second, build high-order interactions.\n\nStrength:\n[1] This paper tries to solve an interesting question and the idea is simple and intuitive\n[2] Experiments show that the proposed approach outperforms a number of baselines\n\nMy comments:\n[1] main concern: lack of ablation study. It would be great to analyze the effects of different components and illustrate/visualize the learned features to see what's the difference and why/how such difference help\n[2] another concern is complexity. It would be great to see learning curve and computational time analysis"}
