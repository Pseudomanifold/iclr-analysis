Instead of sampling the nodes or edges across GCN layers,  this paper proposes to sample the training graph to improve training efficiency and accuracy. It is a smart idea to construct a complete GCN from the sampled subgraphs.  Convincing experiments can verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.  It is a good work.\n\nQuestion: \n1. How can the authors guarantee that subgraphs are properly sampled? Are there any  theoretical guarantee?  \n"}
