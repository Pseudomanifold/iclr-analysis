Using synthetic noisy labels on MNIST and CIFAR, the authors verified that the proposed method can significantly improve the robustness against noisy labels.\n\nDetailed comments:\n\nOverall, the paper is well-written and the ideas are novel. However, experiments are a little weak due to weak baselines and experimental setups (see suggestions for more details). I will consider raising my score according to the rebuttal.\n\nSuggestions:\n\n1. Could the authors consider more baselines like D2L [Ma' 18] and Reweight [Ren' 18] \n\n2. Similar to [Lee' 19], could the authors evaluate the performance of the proposed methods on more realistic noisy labels such as semantic noisy labels and open-set noisy labels? \n\n[Lee' 19] robust inference via generative classifiers for handling noisy labels, In ICML, 2019.\n\n[Ma' 18] Dimensionality-Driven Learning with Noisy Labels, In ICML, 2018.\n\n[Ren' 18] Learning to Reweight Examples for Robust Deep Learning, In ICML, 2018."}
