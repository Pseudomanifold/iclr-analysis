My expertise is so outside of this field that I will rely on the judgement of the other reviewers, whom I hope will have more experience and will better know the literature. \n\nI can only report that the proposed method does not seem to be a particularly good approximation to the zeroth-order method since the mean values for kappa and sigma in table 2 are quite a bit worse than those obtained with the baseline. Of course, the proposed approach is quite a bit faster. However, the paper does not provide a sense of whether these values are actually useful. In practice, would one want to wait longer to get a better quality result, or are the numbers obtained with the proposed approach usable? \n\nAlso, could the proposed approach be applied to other problems? It would be great to see at least one or two other areas where this could be applied to, since I doubt the general ICLR audience is well-versed in nano-porous templates. "}
