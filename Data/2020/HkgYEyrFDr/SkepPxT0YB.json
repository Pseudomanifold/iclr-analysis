They show that better visual representation helps reward maximization.\n\nI have to recommend rejection for this paper. It appears 1) the idea of using curiosity is not originated from this paper; 2) I do not see what is a \"better visual representation\"; 3) the comparison with baselines does not show that the new method is consistently better.\n\nThe paper is also very hard to read. I would think the name \"curious representation learning\" means \"representation learning is curious\". There are many inaccurate languages used in the paper. To list a few: \"complex behavior\", \"in curiosity\", \"disentanglement\"... I do not really understand what does it mean."}
