The main idea is to customize the search space with hardware profiling information, and then iteratively search for the top half and bottom half network structure using coordinate ascent. Overall, the hardware-related analysis is quite inspiring and the results look promising.\n\nPros:\n\n  - Well-motivated and well-written paper.\n  - Hardware profiling information in Figure 1 and Table 2 are quite interesting.\n  - Results look promising. In particular, the DSP model speedup than FBNet/ProxylessNAS/Oneshot-NAS is quite impressive.\n\nCons:\n\nMy main concern is that it couples many things together (new search space, new coordinate ascent, and new search algorithm), and it is not clear where the performance gain comes from.  More ablation studies would be helpful:\n\n- The new search space includes a lot more options than other NAS works presented in Table 2.  For example, none of  FBNet/ProxylessNAS/SinglePath uses SE. For fair comparison, the authors should consider comparing to other NAS works with SE included (such as MnasNet/MobileNetV3).\n- On top of the new search space, the authors propose a new search algorithms with two optimizations: op-level search space reduction and layer-level coordinate ascent. It is not clear how important is each optimization.\n\nI also have a few minor questions to the authors:\n\n- The latency numbers on Table 2 seem to be much lower than expected: for example, FBNet-S8 reports 19.84ms on iPhone CPU and 23.33ms on Samsung S8 CPU in the original paper, but in Table 2, this paper reports >300ms on CPU and >100ms on DSP. Do you have any idea what could be the potential reasons?\n- It is great to see HURRICANE(DSP) model is almost 10x faster than FBNet/ProxylessNAS/SinglePath models. Could you add more discussion about the reasons? This would be helpful to guide future DSP model design.\n"}
