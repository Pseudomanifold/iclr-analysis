It also shows results regarding the probability that a pass to a particular position is attempted. The paper is well-written and the figures and videos do a very nice job of communicating the important ideas. The related work appears to be extensive and the description of the design choices of the architecture and the training procedure is clear and thorough. Based on the results in Table 1, the proposed network appears to compare very favorably against the baselines.\n\nOne thing I feel would make the paper stronger is the inclusion of more baselines and an ablation study. Both Logistic Net and Dense2 Net appear to be very lightweight. It is not obvious to me that all of the design choices made in the paper translated to gains in performance. Would a large network perform well without them? You mention that you tried a class-weighting with no sampling approach but that it did perform as well. Why not include these results in the paper?\n\nSmall typo: \u201cwhere achieved by augmentation\u201d -> \u201cwere achieved by augmentation\u201d\n\nFrom the perspective of someone who is not an expert in this area, I think this is a nice paper. It appears to successfully address an interesting problem, it is well-organized, and its solution methodology may have applications to other related problems. My one major criticism is that I feel that there is insufficient information regarding how the design choices affected the performance."}
