The current manuscript missed some very important information (see below). Besides, the experimental results are also weak.  \nThe paper mentioned \"complex distortions existed in underwater images (e.g., low contrast, blurring, non-uniform brightness, non-uniform color casting and noises)\" many times. But when the paper introduced the UW-Net structure, it does not explain how the network over-comes these difficulties. The UW-Net structure only considers the factors of the background and attention. Thus I think the proposed network structure is not convincing.\nFor the experimental part, I am afraid the results are also weak. For example, please notice that many network structures have proposed to improve the classification. I think authors should compare more existing works to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed one. \n"}
