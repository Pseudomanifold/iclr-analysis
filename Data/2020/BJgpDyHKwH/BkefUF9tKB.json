The main contribution of this paper is to design the better optimization algorithm for compressive Compressive Hyperspherical energy. The difficulty lies in that the dimension is too high. So this paper propose to adopt two dimension reduction schemes: random project and angle-preserving projection. The whole algorithms are clear and easy to understand. Experimental results also demonstrate that the algorithms are effective and get better results in various problems. \n\nThere is theoretical analysis about angle preservation for the projection algorithms. And there are also statistical insights. The theoretical and statistical  analysis should be correct though I did not check them completely. However, the analysis seems not related to network. And I am wondering how the projection helps optimize the networks. This will strengthen the quality of this paper."}
