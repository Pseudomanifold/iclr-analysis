A regression function is built to map training samples to a decision rule at each node and a second network is similarly developed to learn the value at the leaf nodes. They are trained end-to-end with a data loss on the target values with a sparsity term. Experiments show competitive performance which however is worse than the latest state of the art results. \n\nPros:\nGenerally, the paper is technically justified and clearly written.\n\nCons:\n1-\tA further discussion is needed about the exact advantage of the proposed regression networks in comparison with the similar works.\n2-\tThe experimental comparison seems to be insufficient. Only four state-of-the-art methods are compared and in table 1 about the missing results, a reasonable explanation is needed.   \n"}
