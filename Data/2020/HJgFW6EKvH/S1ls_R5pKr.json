In contrast to other audio attacks, the authors claim that the perturbations are well masked and are much less audible. \nThey also claim to propose the first attack mechanism that takes temporal dependency into account, at least in some intuitive sense as described in Figure 2. Simulations show that state of the art speech recognizers can be attacked using the approach and certain type of defenses, based on temporal structure, can be circumvented. \tThe method relies on the idea of using \u2018the proportionally clipped gradient\u2019 as a direction estimate for original audio modification. The basic idea is quite sensible and seems to be effective as supported by computational experiments.\n\nThe dataset is LibriSpeech and the speech recognizer is based on wav2letter+ -- here the MFCC features are replaced with a differentiable version to allow gradient based adversarial attacks. The experimental section is detailed and the results illustrate the \n\nThe fundamental shortcoming with the paper is that while the method is described in detail, there is not much effort in explaining and formalizing what aspects of the proposed method make it perceptually more appealing -- as this seems to be the one of the main motivations of the paper. I would at least expect to see at least some effort to explain the proposed  clipping technique as maintaining the phase properties of the original signal. The authors claim about perceptual properties of the method seem to be somewhat anecdotal and, while I think the method is sensible, just showing the power spectrum is not very informative. Is the proposed method better just because it does good detection of the  silent periods?\n\nI also find the use of technical jargon somewhat ambiguous at occasions (such as the term \u2018linear proportionality\u2019)\n\nMinor:\n\naudios -> waveforms  (audio does not have a plural form ) \n\nFig 2 \u2018frequency - signal frequency\u2019 labels -- this is probably just an estimate of the power spectrum by DFT magnitude\n"}
