In order to make the paper more accessible to a general audience, the authors should:\n1) follow the 1st sentence in the abstract by a new sentence that provides an intuitive example the idea of domain shift from labeled source to unlabeled target domain  \n2)  re-organize the current intro, which reads more like related work, into a more traditional format\n     - one intuitive paragraph about domain adaptation, source/target domain, and domain shift; provide at least one compelling  illustrative example from a real-world application\n     - one intuitive paragraph with an illustrative example on how the proposed approach will help solve a problem; at the same intuitive level, compare-and-contrast it with existing approaches\n     - one intuitive, in-detail paragraph on how the proposed approach works\n     - one paragraph summarizing the main findings/results \n3) ideally, add a section with an illustrative running example, which would have a huge impact on the paper's readability "}
