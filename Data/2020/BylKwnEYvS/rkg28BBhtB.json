From this figure, we can see that the minima is obtained around lambda equals to 0.5. Whether the authors can explain this phenomenon? Besides, the authors should annotate the differences among each curve in each subfigure in Figure 3 and Figure 4.\n3.\tExperiments utilize 8 datasets to demonstrate the good performance of the proposed planted model. The decomposition rank are given in the previously literature. However, in practice, the rank of a new dataset is unavilable. How to handel this situation?\n4.\tThere are unknow elements in Goodbooks, Movielens and Netflix datasets. These can be processed by the given sparsity. However, there is no items in the proposed planted model that can handle the sparsity.\n5.     Open codes about this paper.\n"}
