An initial estimate of depth and pose are used to construct pose and depth cost volumes, which are then fed into a pose regression and depth refinement network, to produce a new set of cost volumes, and so on. In this manner, the pose and depth estimation are improved iteratively.\n\nStrengths:\n\nThe proposed model is well motivated and shows strong performance and generalization ability on several datasets. There are convincing experiments to show the importance of the P-CV network.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\nThe authors claim that the LM optimization in BA-Net is memory inefficient and may lead to non-optimal solutions. It\u2019s not clear to me that the proposed method can guarantee optimality any better. It\u2019s also unclear if the proposed method is more memory efficient, since the authors only unroll 4 iterations of it.\n\nOther comments:\n\nIt would be very interesting to see the test time behavior of the network when it is run with more iterations than it is trained with (say 10 or 20), especially since the depth error does not seem to have stopped decreasing at only 4 iterations.\n\nIt\u2019s not made entirely clear whether the training backpropagates through the update/construction of the pose and depth cost volumes. \n\nIn equation 5, \u201cx\u201d should be \u201ci\u201d.\n", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I assessed the sensibility of the derivations and theory."}
