Extensive experiments on various datasets show that the model achieves the state-of-the-art performance on both depth and pose estimation. In general, the paper is clearly written but I still have several concerns. \n1.\tThe paper is easy to follow but the authors are expected to clarify the rationality in integration of the loss function. How the parameter of \\lambda_r, \\lambda_t, and \\lambda_r influence the performance. It would be better if the authors could present some analysis. \n2.\tThe experiments are rather insufficient. The authors are expected to make more comprehensive analysis with the state-of-the-art methods, and also analyze why some alternative methods outperforms the proposed methods in table I and table II. \n3.\tThe experiments in section 4.3 are also expected to be improved. It is difficult to draw a conclusion that the method is better than other ones based on such limited experiments.  \n"}
