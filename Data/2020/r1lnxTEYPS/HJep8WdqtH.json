The main claim of the paper is that assigning high likelihood to OOD samples in DGMs is due to the mismatch between model\u2019s typical set and its high probability density areas. \n\nI liked the idea of proposing a hypothesis testing approach for finding OOD samples generated from a model; however, my main concern is that the approach has some major practical limitation that the authors have also rightly mentioned in their discussion. It seems that even with a hypothesis testing tool for OOD detection, the model capacity and other properties of the model are more fundamental and critical for OOD detection in DGMs. In other words, how this tool can be useful in practice if the models are misspecified and how robust is the tool with respect to model properties. This major limitation has not been addressed in the experiments. \n\nThis paper, does a good job in finding the OOD data points if the likelihood histograms do not overlap using the typicality notion. However, this idea had already been proposed and explored in Choi. et al. 2019 (although for a flow-based model). This makes the technical novelty of the work less significant. \n\nOverall, I think the paper needs some improvement in terms of discussing the robustness of the test with respect to model properties; otherwise, it is just another typicality set explanation of why DGMs may produce high likelihood values for OOD samples which has already been mentioned in previous work.
