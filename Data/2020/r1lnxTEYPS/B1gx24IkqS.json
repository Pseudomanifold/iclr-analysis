It uses the so-called typical set to transform the problem to determining whether the data points lie in the typical set of the given distribution. It proposes a statistical test using the empirical distribution of model likelihoods to determine whether inputs lie in the typical set if the considered model. \n\nThe motivation of the work is very clear, and the paper is well organized. The basic idea of using the typical set to check whether given data points are from a given distribution seems sensible, as guaranteed by Theorem 2.1.\n\nMy concern is about the performance of the proposed method compared to alternatives. First, a standard approach to the considered problems seems to be the two-sample tests (or its approximations or variations), so it would be desirable to compare the typical set-based approach with the two-sample test approaches theoretically. In particular, given that you have to allow some error when using typical sets, what is exactly the advantage of the proposed approach?  Second, according to the empirical results (Section 5), the proposed method does not seem to clearly outperform alternatives such as KS-test. In this case, a better justification of the reliability of the proposed approach would be helpful."}
