The experimental results seem surprisingly promising. The ablation studies show that both image and label interpolating help the robustness improvement. \n\nI think it is important to provide a running time comparison between the proposed method and SOTA robust training method such as Madry's. Since the feature extractor is implemented by excluding the last layer for the logits, the backprop goes through almost the entire model. It seems that the proposed interpolating method has a similar amount of computation as PGD, so the training should take similar time as Madry's if it can converge quickly. \n\nAlso, there are too many works on robustness defense that have been proven ineffective (consider the works by Carlini). Since this is a new way of robust training and there is no certified guarantee, I would be very conservative and suggest the authors refer the checklist in [1] to evaluate the effectiveness of the defense more thoroughly to convince the readers that it really works. Especially, a robustness evaluation under adaptive attacks is necessary. In other words, if the attacker knows the strategy used by the defender, it may be possible to break the model. PGD and CW are non-adaptive since no defender information is provided. \n\n[1] Carlini, Nicholas, et al. \"On evaluating adversarial robustness.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1902.06705 (2019)."}
