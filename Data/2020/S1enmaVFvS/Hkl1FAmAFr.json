Experiments were conducted on over 120K 3D samples of crystals and the results seem to be promising.\n\nThe paper is neatly written and well organized.\n\nComments:\n\nA) Figure 2: For completion, consider marking M and S as outputs of the VAE and U-Net respectively. \n\nB) In Section 3.1, why do the authors use a cube with side of \u201910\u2019 Angstrom? And why divide the cube into \u201930\u2019 bins?\n\nC) The paper revolves on vanilla 3D convolutions of the crystal structures. Have the authors considered how the results would change if SO(3) rotation invariant convolutions were used instead. The SO(3) convolutions would empower capturing all possible rotations of the crystal other than only its canonical form."}
