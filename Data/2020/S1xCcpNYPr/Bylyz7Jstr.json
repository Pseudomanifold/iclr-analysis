In this way, an estimate of the output distribution is considered during the extraction of the representative subset of the testing data.\n\nThe whole process is divided into two phases, the first is to create a first subset using HGS, the second refines this subset in order to achieve the desired precision in the output distribution.\n\nThe paper also presents a good experimental campaign that shows good performances.\n\nThe paper is really well written and enjoyable, clear in its description and in the objectives it aims to achieve. To improve the readability a bit further, I would suggest trying to move equation 1 after or close to its reference, or at least to describe before it what KL is.\nMoreover, a similar problem is present for TI, which is introduced in Algorithm 1 and described later. I would add, for example in the input section of the algorithm, a sentence stating that TI is used in getCandidate and described later.\n\nThe first sentence on page 5 seems to be incomplete as it is written. I would suggest rephrasing the sentence.\n\nIn Algorithm 2, about the two \"for\" cycles for i in 1,m and foreach k in 2,K, I suggest unifying them and use the same cycle (only for reasons of readability). Moreover, I think that using braces instead of parentheses would be more correct in these cycles.\n\nIt is interesting to note that in the first line for VGG19, last column of Table 3, the accuracy is lower with KL < 0.001 than with KL < 0.005. I would expect monotonicity here. Do the authors have any idea of the reasons for this?\n\nFinally, it would be interesting to know the runtime to obtain the subsets of the test data of Table 2 required by the considered systems.\n\nTypos:\nOn page 6, penultimate paragraph, the word \"the\" is repeated twice in the parentheses.\nOn page 8, at the beginning of the first sentence after Table 3, there is a comma that seems to be useless after the word \"that\".\nOn page 8, \"When the termination crite gets stricter\", crite should be corrected in criterion.\nThere is a typo in the README of the github project linked in the paper: \"coveraeg data\" instead of \"coverage data\"."}
