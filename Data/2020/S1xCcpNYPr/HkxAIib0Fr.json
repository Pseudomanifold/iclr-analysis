In this paper, the work is done by adding a test-sample search algorithm on top of the HGS algorithm to balance the output distribution.\n\nHowever, the novelty of the proposed work is limited, and there is no evidence to show the proposed algorithms can be applied to other related works. Furthermore, the result does not present a strong success: the error of output distribution is much worse than the compared work.\n\nOther comments to the proposed manuscript are:\n\n1. In Definition 1 the authors declare that the goal is to satisfy f(T,M)=f(T\u2019M) and g(T,M)=g(T\u2019M), and then in the following paragraphs they change it to f(T,M)\u2248f(T\u2019M) and g(T,M)\u2248g(T\u2019M) with no justification. More explanation is needed.\n\n2. In Table 2, the authors try to compare the output distribution. To better demonstrate the change between raw testing set and proposed subset, I think that it could be better to present the metrics of distribution or the accuracy of each class instead.\n"}
