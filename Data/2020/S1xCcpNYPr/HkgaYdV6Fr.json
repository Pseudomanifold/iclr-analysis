The paper proposes  a two-phase reduction approach to select representative samples based on heuristics. Extensive experiments have shown the proposed methods can reduce 95% test samples while still obtaining similar measurements. \n\nThe paper targets a very important problem in practice. Effectively selecting small, representative test sets can save many computational resources and greatly accelerate the research and development. Although the developed technique is quite simple, they are meaningful in practice. Overall, the work can be much improved if a theoretical framework is proposed. \n\n"}
