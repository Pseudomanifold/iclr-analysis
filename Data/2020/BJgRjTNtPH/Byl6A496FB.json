This paper combines the strengths of self-organizing maps (SOMs) for representation learning and CNNs for image classification. Specifically, it uses SOMs to transform multi-omic data into a gene similarity network (GSN) for representation learning and uses CNNs for classification of disease states. And this scheme also provides an enhanced scheme to interpret and visualize multi-dimensional and multi-omics data.\nHowever, there are some concerns about this work: \n1.\tThe motivation of using self-organizing map learning algorithm to create the gene similarity network (GSN) is not clear enough. \n2.\tThe related works about dimensionality reduction and representation learning methods in gene expression data are missing.\n3.\tThe experiment results are not very convincing, because there is no comparison with other approaches. In particular, the work of (Hopp et al., 2018) which is mentioned in section 3.3 is a close method.\n4.\tThis paper is not well written, and there are some minor issues as follows:\n4.1.\tThe abstract claims that \u201cyielding prediction accuracies in the 94-98% range for tumor stages of breast cancer and calculated Gleason scores of prostate cancer with just 11 input genes for both cases\u201d. However, the section 2.1 mentions that \u201cThe top 14 mutated genes from Multisig were considered for the rest of the experiment\u201d, which one is right?\n4.2.\tIn section 2.3, the description of the method is not very clear, for example, the seventh rows on page 4: \u201cwhere $s^(1)_{1j}= g_j} represents the gene vector for $i^{th}$ sample and $c_{j1}$ represents neuron vector\u201d .\n4.3.\tThe equation (6) may be wrong, since $R^{i}_j$, $G^{i}_j $, $B^{i}_j $ are all equal to $S^{i}_{1j}$.\n"}
