Instead of estimating the gradient of a black-box model, the proposed method estimates the sign of the gradient, which is an easier task. The SignHunter algorithm is proposed to estimate the sign of the gradient by a divide-and-conquer search. And adversarial examples are generated based on the sign gradient. Extensive experiments prove the effectiveness of the proposed attack method.\n\nOverall, the proposed method on estimating the sign of the gradient for black-box attacks is novel. The authors provide sufficient analysis to present the algorithm, making it clear to see the advantage of the proposed method over previous methods. I have some minor comments on this paper.\n\n1. In Section 2 (Line 15), the authors argue that \"However, the queries are not adaptive, they are constructed based on i.i.d. random vectors {vi}\". However, in Ilyas et al. (2019), the queries are designed based on the time prior, which are actually adaptive.\n\n2. Estimating the sign of the gradient is more suitable for attacks based on the l_\\infty norm, but could affect the results for l_2 attacks, since it reduces the search space. The experiments also show that the proposed method for l_2 attacks is not as effective as l_\\infty attacks.\n\n3. It's better to show some tabular results in Section 4 rather than appendix to compare the performance with numbers."}
