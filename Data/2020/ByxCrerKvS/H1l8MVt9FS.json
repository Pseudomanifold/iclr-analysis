The idea is certainly faster than the sequential algorithms such as RNNs and their extensions. However, as shown in the experiments, because it does not encode the \"sequential-ness prior\" to the model, it is less accurate. Compared to RNNs, the proposed model has better access to the entire length of sequences and does not suffer from the limited memory issues of RNNs and variants.\n\nThe proposed idea in this paper can be considered a simplified version of the Transformers. Like transformers, the time and order are only provided to the model using the positional encoding and attention is central to aggregation over the sequence. Realizing the relationship with the Transformers not only decreases the novelty degree for this paper but also requires the authors to include the Transformers in the baselines.\n\nFinally, the results reported in the experiments are nice, especially for the baseline GRU-D! However, the MIMIC-III Mortality benchmark has a lot more than 21,000 stays to the best of my recollection. Can you please elaborate on how the number of data points has decreased?"}
