The paper is well-written and easy to be followed.\n2. The research problem is of great value to be investigated.\n\nWeaknesses of the paper:\n1. The idea of utilizing anchors to reduce the size of features (in your case, the total embeddings of discrete objects to be inferred) has been widely studied in related fields in computer science. For instance, there are a number of papers in the field of manifold learning using anchors to reduce the size. The inherent connections and relationships between the proposed methods and other algorithms using anchors should be carefully discussed.\n2. The contribution of the paper seems not significant, as the idea of utilizing anchors to reduce the number of parameters to be inferred has been widely studies in the related work. There are a number of papers utilizing anchors, such as the followings (just list some of them):\nB. Xu et al., Efficient manifold ranking for image retrieval, in SIGIR 2011.\nS. Liang et al., Manifold learning for rank aggregation, in WWW 2018.\nY. Guo et al., Learning to hash with optimized anchor embedding for scalable retrieval, in TIP, 2017.\nIn the last reference aforementioned above, both anchors and embeddings are jointly taken into account. \n3. Baselines should include some manifold learning algorithms that take anchors into account.\n", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I carefully checked the derivations and theory."}
