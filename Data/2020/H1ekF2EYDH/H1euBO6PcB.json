The authors claim this is the first of it's technology specific Chinese KG, so they claim scale, specificity and list out various aspects that makes this distinct to existing KG's. \n\nA few things that the paper is missing or not written well:\n1. Related work is pretty much just listing existing KG's but no limitations and how those limitations are addressed by this work other than the fact that tech KG is technology specific. By being technology specific how does it help, where is KG being used and what metrics are current KG's fall short etc.\n2. There is no novelty in the way KG is built, so there is no technical contribution to this paper making it a very weak submission for ICLR standards.\n3. There is a huge appendix section with some results and lot of information. It would have been great to distill how KG's are being used in existing benchmarks and either show the value of a tech KG in the metrics/benchmarks or introduce a new metric or benchmark to measure the value of a specific domain KG like the tech KG.\n\nIf the authors can address these issues, the value of the work can increase significantly."}
