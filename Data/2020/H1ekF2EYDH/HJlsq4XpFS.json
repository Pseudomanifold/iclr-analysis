The authors have described in details the process and heuristics in use for constructing such knowledge base, and also reported important statistics and characteristics of the database, including duplicate name, imbalance issue etc. The main contribution is to provide a KG in Chinese, which wasn\u2019t widely available compared to popular languages such as English.\n\nThe paper does not clearly demonstrate experiment showing how this new knowledge graph can be complementary to or benefit existing realm of machine learning tasks. How much does it help improve KG-dependent task in Chinese language, or in multi-lingual setting? Without these experiments, it\u2019s hard to estimate precisely the contribution of the KG database to the machine learning community. \n\nIn Section 3.1, the authors should specify more clearly the source of the journals collected & the representativeness of the repository.\n\nIn Section 3.3, how is the threshold defined to determine the hierarchical relation from k1 to k2?\n \nThe writing can be polished further. Things to improve the paper that did not impact the score:\n\nPage 1: Great progress have been -> great progress has been\nPage 1: most of existing -> many existing\nSection 2, paragraph 4: lack space between `WordNet` and `Miller`, also need adding space between `YAGO` and `suchanek`\n\n"}
