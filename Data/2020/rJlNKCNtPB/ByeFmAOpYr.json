It uses multiple thresholds and then varies the number of hash functions among different scores regions to obtain better trade-off. Detailed theoretical analysis provides guaranteed superiority over learned Bloom filter under some conditions. The experiments also show the two proposed methods outperform learned Bloom filter in FPR and memory usage.\n\nThe motivation is based on the observation that the keys' score distribution density has an opposite trend to the non-keys. Though the experiment results support this observation, some theoretical analysis on this and its relationship with the final FPR could be provided. "}
