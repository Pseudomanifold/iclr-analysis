In the case where training is required or finetuning is needed to adapt the system to another distribution, the the proposed auxiliary LUT could have a hard time mapping input data properly.\n\n(2) In my understanding, the transformation, T: supp(P) -> R, is assumed to be known whilst IMO it is crucial to the proposed method. A non-trivial effort is expected in finding T, and a whole area of research is dedicated to this which is Optimal Transport. Currently, plausible and computationally efficient method is through Sinkhorn algorithm. I don't think the paper should downplay the part of finding T as it is crucial.\n\n(3) In the shared Index PWLs, the paper seems to have ignored the fact that different functions still have different output values, and different key-value pairs are indeed needed. For example, log(x) and x^2 (as used in the paper) have different input domains and output domains, so sharing indices between two functions is impossible. Could the authors elaborate on why it is okay to share indices?\n\n(4) A necessary process of LUT from piece-wise linear functions of approximating the ones that we care about is to conduct 1-D density estimation on the input domain, since more fine-grained splits are required in the dense area and less splits elsewhere. The proposed methods in this paper seem to have largely ignored this effect. For example, log(x) needs splits with smaller intervals when the x is around 1. \n\n(5) The presented results only include the speed of the forward computation of several models. It is okay if there is a performance (accuracy or likelihood) and speed trade-off, but the paper didn't present any results on this. Could the authors present some results for this?\n\n"}
