The operations in each group, which is called a stage, will be executed in parallel to improve utilization of hardware. They claim that the proposed Deep Optimal Scheduling (DOS) can discover a globally optimal schedule, but no theoretical proof is provided. This claim is apparently wrong, it can not even find optimal solution for the following example:\n\ninput ---> op1-------+->ouput\n|                                |\n+---->op2---->op3---+\n\nIf execution time of op1 is larger than summation of op2 and op3, the optimal solution should be start two parallel computation threads, one for op1, the other one for op2-->op3.  If DOS is used, it will first process op1 and op2 in parallel, than process op3, or process op2 first, then process op1, op3 in parallel.\n\nFor the experimental part, they only compare DOS with Metaflow in terms of search time, runtime latency comparison should be provided.\n\nThe writing of this paper is bad, for example, they use \"S\" to represent stage, then it is used to represent  \"state\" or \"set\". It makes me confused.  They should polish their paper before submission."}
