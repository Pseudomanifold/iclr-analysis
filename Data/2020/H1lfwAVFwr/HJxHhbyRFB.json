It derives the gradient of this modified objective and then proceeds to evaluate the resulting \"SAC with mutual information\" to demonstrate (i) better sample efficiency and (ii) generalization to environment change.\n\n\n# Decision\nThe paper proposes an interesting approach but a more thorough evaluation is needed before it can be recommended for publication.\n\n\n# Comments\nThe theoretical contribution is quite small since the connection to RD theory is well established by now, e.g., see papers by Daniel Alexander Braun from Ulm and his students. Therefore, the main contribution is incorporation of the mutual information into SAC. Then the question is what properties/advantages/disadvantages such approach brings. And on this front, the paper is quite weak.\n\nThe chain environment is quite toy-ish and may only serve to indicate that the implementation is correct. The continuous control environments are more interesting, but the learning curves look very unreliable. Just a quick Google search for SAC results on Roboschool reveals much smoother and higher learning curves (e.g., https://medium.com/@kengz/soft-actor-critic-for-continuous-and-discrete-actions-eeff6f651954). It would be paramount to make sure that the baselines are fairly represented in the evaluations.\n\nThe generalization in continuous control is only evaluated on the pendulum by varying length and mass. It is insufficient to make a decisive judgement. Moreover, length and mass are coupled, such that different combinations of length and mass may yield similar dynamics.\n\n=> If better sample efficiency and better generalization are claimed, then a more thorough evaluation is required.\n\nIn general, writing can be improved, figure made nicer and smaller, introduction and connections section made shorter, and the main derivation moved from the Appendix into the main body and explained better.\n"}
