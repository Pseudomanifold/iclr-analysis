The author(s) simply use DenseNet in this work. They also address the visualization of the output of the convolutional layers (visualization of layer wise activation using matplotlib in python) to provide interpretations for what the network is doing as it classifies images. \n\nFrom a method perspective, I fail to see any contribution of this work. Looking at the output of layer activation is not new, certainly not in the way it is presented in this work. Given the focus of this conference, I am not sure that this work is appropriate here. There are no real contributions to AI or Machine Learning proposed in this paper, not from a method perspective and also not from an application perspective. \n\nAlso, while the authors do report on experiments performed on an interesting corpus of images, I find the evaluation quite shallow. I concede that it is difficult to measure or estimate interpretability as it is mostly a qualitative concept. However, the paper could benefited at least from a small user study. At this point, I recommend a rejection for ICLR 2020. "}
