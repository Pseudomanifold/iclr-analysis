Such a method is supported by the KL divergence and lower bound theory and the paper well formulates/describes the capacity concept. In the experiments, the proposed method is compared with other conventional methods with well-designed subjective and objective metrics and shows the effectiveness in terms of the style transfer. The paper is well written in general.\n\nOne of the difficulties in this paper is reproducibility. The paper does not seem to provide source code and part of the data used in this paper also does not seem to be public data like libriTTS (I would be wrong but I could read that the multispeaker training data are not public), although I appreciate the authors' efforts to provide the implementation and evaluation details as much as possible in the appendix.\n\nAnother discussion of this paper is that it is not explicit to provide the meaning of the latent variables (this is a general issue in VAE) and I could not be fully convinced by the discussion and analysis based on the latent variable. There would be several semi-supervised studies to explicitly connect some (elements) of latent variables with actual attributes and I'd like to ask the authors to consider such direction to make the latent variable discussion in the paper more plausible.\n"}
