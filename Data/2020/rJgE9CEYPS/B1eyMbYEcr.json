Several manually designed features based on the pretrained networks are supervised trained on a light-weighted network like the teacher-student module. \n\nThis paper should be rejected because (1) the novelty of the algorithm is limited: only using the well-known intra-class distance and inter-class distance as features. Besides, the superiority of such features should be better explained; (2) Similarly, the discriminability of testing image is too complicated, such as Eq. (9, 10). Why these params are designed in such ways? Explain them; (3) Why don\u2019t you learn the discriminability by directly operating on the extracted pretrained features? The used two distances certainly are not the best choices compared with learning methods. You should compare the performance with your methods of training under the manually-designed features. (4) The written is poor, such as Figure 6: \u201ctable ??\u201d; Table 2: \u201cavgerage\u201d. \n"}
