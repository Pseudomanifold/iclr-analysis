The novel aspect of this work seems to be a version of the agent producing partial actions (i.e., portion of the action tuple is clamped to pre-specified values). This new agent receives the clamped components of the action as an additional conditioning input.\n\nPros:\n+ In some cases, images produced by the system look appealing.\n\nCons:\n- The writing of the manuscript could be significantly improved. I had a hard time understanding certain parts of the paper (e.g., what \u201cconstrained\u201d means in the context of the present work). I got an impression that there was an effort to make things look more complex than they really are.\n- The proposed model lacks novelty \u2013 there seems to be only one non-trivial contribution and I\u2019m not entirely sure how useful it is. The authors never compare their system against a simple baseline when one just overrides the actions of the agent.\n- In general, the evaluation section of the paper leaves a lot to be desired. The authors report some numbers (most of which are not even for the proposed model) but I\u2019m struggling to make anything out of that information. Why should I care about them? What interesting conclusions can I draw from them? The paper never discusses this. On top of that, there are no baselines.\n\nNotes/questions:\n* At test time, the policy receives renders from a real environment. Could that create problems since it has only been trained on images synthesized by a neural surrogate?\n* Abstract: \u201con many benchmarks\u201d -> \u201con several benchmarks\u201d\n* Section 1: \u201cwe use a constraint representation along with \u2026\u201d \u2013 this sentence needs to be rewritten.\n* Section 2: Missing reference \u2013 Neural Painters (Nakano, 19). Considers a neural surrogate of the libmypaint environment.\n* Section 2, last paragraph:  \u201cboth methods can work on either a small action space or a small observation space\u201d \u2013 how is the present model different? The action space is very similar (albeit continuous) to the existing approaches (i.e., relies on Bezier curves much like in (Ganin et al., 18)).\n* Section 2, last paragraph: The last sentence needs to be rewritten (\u201cuncontrollable agent\u201d looks a bit strange)\n* Section 3, first paragraph: \u201cWe highlight all \u2026\u201d -> \u201cWe describe all \u2026\u201d\n* Section 4.1, first paragraph: The first sentence needs to be rewritten (\u201cthe corresponding canvas by the given action\u201d).\n* Section 4.1, first paragraph: \u201cUnlike the previous \u2026\u201d \u2013 not true. (Ganin et al., 18) proposes to use this environment and (Nakano, 19) trains a neural surrogate for it.\n* Section 4.4: \u201cWGAN loss (Huang et al., 19)\u201d \u2013 this WGAN loss was introduced in (Ganin et al., 18).\n* Section 5: I feel like the paper could do a better job at explaining what \u201cconstraining\u201d really means and justifying why it\u2019s an interesting problem to solve. In my opinion, Eq. (3), for example, obscures rather than clarifies the notion of \u201cconstraints\u201d.\n* Section 5, paragraph 2: \u201cFor each different\u201d -> \u201cFor each\u201d\n* Section 5.1, paragraph 4: \u201cpi\u201d -> \u201c\\pi\u201d\n* Figure 5: The caption almost overlaps with the text below.\n* Section 6.3, paragraph 2: \u201cl2\u201d -> \u201cl_2\u201d\n* Section 7, paragraph 2: \u201cdiffering\u201d -> \u201cdifferent\u201d\n\nI feel like the authors should perform a major re-writing of the manuscript before it\u2019s ready for publication. Moreover, I failed to see any significantly novel aspects of the proposed system (maybe due to the poor presentation) and therefore I wouldn\u2019t recommend the paper for acceptance."}
