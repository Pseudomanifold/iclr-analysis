In terms of technical novelty, the paper seems to be applying a standard RL agent to an existing problem space, to optimize existing losses. The addition of constraints is technically very simple. The paper itself fails to articulate a compelling statement of novelty, for example, in discussing Huang 2019, the paper just says that a limitation of that method is that it uses OpenCV and that it doesn\u2019t provide a system for control. Removing OpenCV is not a publishable contribution and shouldn\u2019t even be mentioned; the control mechanism is not particularly novel.\n\nSome of the results do look nice, but it\u2019s hard to say that the method has improved over the past 20 years of stroke-based rendering, e.g., many of the results look worse than those in Hertzmann 1998. The paper doesn\u2019t offer any meaningful comparisons to the previous work, such as fair side-by-side comparisons on the same images, comparing computation times and aesthetics. The paper doesn\u2019t articulate any aesthetic goals or state any meaningful standard by which the images might have improved over previous work. The control mechanism is not tested in any meaningful way (e.g., user studies), and the changes it makes to the results seem fairly trivial (e.g., contrast can be added to an image just as well via a post-process).\n\nI\u2019m not sure what ICLR\u2019s policy on citing previous unrefereed work is, but one paper that seems to have much more interesting results in a similar context is: https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.08410 .
