I particular like the 3 ablation studies that the authors include, which makes the empirical analysis very thorough.\n\nWriting and Clarity:\nThe introduction is written quite well. Section II&III is written quite technical and dense. This can be very hard to understand for non-experts. However these section are  important to understand the  rest paper. Finally, these two sections should be integrated (preliminaries, quite literally, should be at the beginning). Section 5 \n\n\nAdditional Questions:\n1. Philosophically, how does the self-improvement for iterative planning problems not contradict the no-free lunch theorem? What kind of repeated structure do we assume here (because it seems as in Fig. 1 both the obstacles as well as the goal state change randomly)\n2. As you employ a neural network to do value iteration how does the wall-clock time compare to the baselines?  I do not mean the environment time-ticks (that you checked for using the number of collision checks), but actual compute time. \n3. How sensitive is the proposed solution to parameter initialization?  Did you find much variation in changing hyper-parameters, such as network topology, learning rate et cetera?\n"}
