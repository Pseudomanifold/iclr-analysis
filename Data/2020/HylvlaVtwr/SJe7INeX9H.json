To improve upon previous approaches, learning policies for an interactive task of \u2018sitting onto a chair\u2019 in considered. A hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) method is proposed. The proposed HRL, learns a collection of simpler tasks through imitation and deploys a meta controller to perform short subtasks in order to complete the longer interactive task. Experimental results are presented on single synthetic domain. Also, results on image conditioned motion prediction are demonstrated.\n\n+ the interactive tasks exampled in this paper are interesting and if these set of tasks expanded, learning suitable policies can be impactful. \n\n+ The paper is well written and mostly clear to understand. \n\n- From the technical side, this paper does not offer any technical novelty. The approach is heavily built upon prior works of Schulman et al., 2017, Peng et al. 2018a.\n\n- Only one task (i.e. sitting onto a chair) is considered as the core problem in this paper. \n\n- The experimental results are very weak. It is not clear if the proposed approach is offering any benefit over prior HRL approaches. \n\n- Comparison with prior works is not conducted.\n\n- There has been only a limited of demonstrations on how the approach could be applied on real images and it is not clear what would be the implication of this work on real problems or in real world setup o even more generic real images. \n\nBased on the above explanations, this paper does not have technical novelty and the experimental results are not convincing. Therefore, it does not meet the bar for publication. \n"}
