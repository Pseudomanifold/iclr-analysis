It claims that a specific classifier, e.g., a VGG, or other type of CNN, will produce a different signature image from another classifier, or from the same classifier when trained with manipulated data, e.g., by an unknown  Trojan. Some results are shown that illustrate how this signature feature can be used to differentiate between 4 different CNNs, or when data are manipulated.\nAlthough the paper has some merit, in creating and using the specific signature, there is no deeper analysis of why and how this feature can differentiate between classifiers, or of the dependence on the problem under investigation. It cannot be claimed to produce a robust feature that can be applied to quite diverse cases and environments (the inability to handle, for example all-to-all attacks is admitted in the paper). Moreover, the title is misleading, since the method does not necessarily refers to CNNs, but in general to some classifier. "}
