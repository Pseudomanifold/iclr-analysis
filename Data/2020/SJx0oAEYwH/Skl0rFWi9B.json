The new framework is built upon a new concept termed cover filtration based on the generalized Steinhaus distance derived from Jaccard distance. A staple path discovery mechanism is then developed using this filtration based on persistent homology. Experiments on Movielense and FashionMNIST has quantitatively and qualitatively demonstrated the effectiveness of the new model. It also showcases the explainable factors with visualized samples from FashionMNIST dataset. In addition, theoretical discussion in the appendix makes the theory part of this work solid and convincing.\n\n* The method introduced in this paper is intuitive and demonstrates with meaningful outcomes.\n\n* The method itself is built upon the SOTA method \u201cMapper\u201d. Authors may want to clearly state the difference between the new method and Mapper in writing.\n\n* The overall structure of this paper needs some improvement. Authors attempt to introduce a new distance metric as an intermediate level representation. This is not very clear at the beginning; instead, most of the introduction is related to TDA and mapper, which may confuse people not from this particular field.\n\n* What is the meaning of D_St under definition 3.1? Is this the same as d_St or not?\n\n* It seems the restrictions in the experiments are strong, which can be found from a few settings in the experiments. For example, the authors claim that \u201cTo reduce computational expenses and noise, we remove all movies with less than 10 ratings and then sample 4000 movies at random from the remaining movies.\u201d It seems the model may not work well in a more general case...\n\n* The pre-processing steps for filtration cover seem verbose on FashionMNIST \u201cThe model is evaluated at 93% accuracy on the remaining 10,000 images. We then extract the 10-dimensional predicted probability space and use UMAP (McInnes & Healy, 2018) to reduce the space to 2 dimensions. This 2-dimensional space is taken as the filter function of the Mapper, using a cover consisting of 40 bins along each dimension with 50% overlap between each bin.\u201d Not sure if this method will work well without fine-tuning or feature selection like this.\n"}
