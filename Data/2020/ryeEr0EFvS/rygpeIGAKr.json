It proposes a representational hierarchy of GNNs. (D-1, L-1,..D-n, L-n). L-k is the k-hop neighborhood including all edges. And D-k is L-k without edges between the outermost nodes. The discriminative power of a network using L-1 is > WL-1. On various graph classification/regression tasks, the proposed method shows good performance. Show promising result on QM7b QM9 graph regression task  (counting triangles, cycles etc) which\u00a0are highly relevant to the proposed method.\n\nSome concerns:\n\n1, the theoretical results seem a bit incremental compared with (Xu et al. 2018).\n\n2. it would be nice to comment on how this will affect cases with nontrivial node features and general node classification tasks.\n\n3.\u00a0 the empirical results are not very convincing. On standard datasets/tasks, the baselines are not state-of-the-arts. The results only show the advantage of the proposed idea over basic GCNs. Synthetic and results on QM7b QM9 are specific for triangles and cycles which is the model designed for. Overall, it is not very clear what the proposed idea brings to GNN in a general setting.\n\nGiven these concerns, I am leaning toward weak reject at this moment. \n"}
