As I understand, the proposed GCN should by construction count the triangles (target variable) for each node embedding and then predict a linear function of those aggregated. My intuition says that this may even be an advantage over adding more layers. The text states the opposite. Here it would be interesting to see the effect of adding layers, or aggregating over longer random walks.\nHere, it would be important to get the prediction of an untrained baseline in addition to the GCN baseline (e.g. the expected number of triangles/4cycles based on number of nodes in the Erd\u00f6s Renyi model) to understand the scale the Mean Squared Error lives on and what the relative improvement means."}
