The new model class generalizes the aggregation step to multiple levels of neighbors. The new model generalizes existing models. Theoretically, the paper shows the generalized models enjoy better discriminative power. The paper also conducts experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new model class.\n\n\nComments:\n1. The design of new models is straightforward, and the theoretical analysis is trivial, given Xu et al. 2019. The paper would be improved if the author(s) can provide optimization or generalization analysis.\n\n2. The statement about experiments is misleading. The paper claims SOTA results on several datasets. However, this paper does not report recent SOTA results:\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1809.02670\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00826\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13192\n\n3. The use of the phrase \"random walk\" is weird. As there is no randomness at all.\n\n"}
