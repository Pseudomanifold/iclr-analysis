The network has a feedforward structure which provides a good control of its polynomial order. Empirical study shows that deep LPNN models achieve good performances in regression and classification tasks. In general, the paper is clearly written by addressing an interesting problem but I still have several concerns. \n1.\tThe authors are expected to analyze the time complexity in terms of both theoretical and experimental analysis since the time cost the one of the major limitation of PNN. \n2.\tThe experimental section is rather weak since the authors only report results in some simple data. The authors are expected to report more complex tasks to show its effectivenss. \n3.\tIt would be interesting if the authors could show whether the algorithm can integrate with other structure such as convolutional operator to cope with the image classification, and other relevant tasks.   \n"}
