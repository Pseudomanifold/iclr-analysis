The analysis\nis theoretical under the classical assumption of lipschitz\nbounded non-linearities and looking at the limit case\nof an infinite number of neurons. The paper is well\nwritten and comes with public code that allows to replicate\nthe experiments illustrating the theoretical derivations.\n\nThe paper is well motivated and addresses a timely matter.\n\nTypos\n\n- \"the error of the output of\" -> \"the error of the output\"\n"}
