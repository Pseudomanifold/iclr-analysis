This is a very popular topic and is very relevant in big data analysis. A lot of work has been done in this general area and on the problems that are discussed in the paper. The new idea in the paper is better streaming algorithms under the assumption that there is a \u201cheavy hitters\u201d oracle that returns data items that have a lot of representation in the stream. The authors give provably better algorithms for the distinct elements problem, F_p moment problem (p > 2), and some more problems. These are important problems in streaming data analysis. They improve the space bounds and interestingly in some cases the bounds are better than what is possible without the oracle assumption. This also shows the power of such an oracle. There are experimental results to demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithms. At a high level the work seems good and interesting for a large audience interested in streaming data analysis. I have not gone over the proofs in detail (much of which is in the appendix).\n\n- Even though oracle results are interesting, to make it practical it may make sense to talk about a more realistic, weaker oracle where some of the queries may be incorrect.\n- It may even make sense to minimise the number of oracle calls which can be thought of as a resource and discuss the relationship between number of oracle calls and other resources such as space.\n"}
