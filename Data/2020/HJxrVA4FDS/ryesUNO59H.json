It seeks to disentangle the need for top-down and horizontal connections for grouping tasks using (a) a new synthetic dataset that seeks to evaluate one over the other, and (b) a new recurrent neural network model.\n\n\nI think this is an interesting scientific question that is worth answering. It is especially useful given the context of what we know about the visual cortex in the brain, which is the presence of a large number of horizontal and top-down connections.\nI think this paper takes a good first step in understanding this. I liked the problem setup and the approach of looking at accuracy at a given sample complexity rather than accuracy alone. I also liked the fact that the authors used both deeper networks and state-of-the-art baselines and corrected for the parameter count. In these respects the paper is novel and thought-provoking.\n\nI would like the evaluation to be stronger, however. I would like to see the following experiments: \n(1) How do variants of the architecture (deeper/shallower) perform under the same settings? Do the conclusions change with network depth?\n(2) How do these results generalize to real-world segmentation datasets? Are both top-down and horizontal connections needed for e.g., PASCAL/COCO?\n\nSince this is not a vision conference, I am giving this a weak accept, but I would really like to see at least an evaluation of (2)."}
