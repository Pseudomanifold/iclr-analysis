The bound being exponential in the planning horizon is bad news, and has some implications with respect to further analysing sample complexity in RL.\n\nThe gist of this paper is that one can craft a hard MDP which requires visiting every state at least once, and that since this MDP's state space is exponential in the MDP's horizon, then there exists a set of MDPs which require an exponential (in the horizon) number of trajectories to be solved. As a consequence, further analysis of sample complexity in RL may need some much stronger assumptions.\n\nThe writing of the paper is good, I was able to understand everything (I think). As far as I can tell, this is novel work. Unfortunately I am currently unable to see why this contribution is valuable. I have set my score to weak reject but I am very open to having my mind changed, as I feel I may have missed some critical element.\n\nI have two criticisms:\nA- I don't understand why this bound is significantly different than previous bounds.\nB- I don't understand why this is bad news for representation learning, nor how this failure mode of linear features translates to the \"deep\" case.\n\nIn the same spirit, I find rather odd the way the paper is introduced. Discussions of representations usually involve some discussion of generalization, but that's not what this paper is about. Deep neural networks/representation learning are only useful if there is an opportunity for generalization.\n\n\nWith respect to A, I am either grossly misunderstanding past bounds and/or your bounds, or something is wrong with the way complexities are compared:\n- In Wen & Van Roy, the \"polynomial\" sample complexity is in the number of states, it is related to |S|x|A|xH^2 (Theorem 3 of Wen & Van Roy)\n- In this paper, Theorem 4.1 states that the sample complexity is exponential because it is of the form 2^H. One *critical* assumption for this bound is precisely that |S| >= 2^H. Thus the bound that you propose is still polynomial in |S|.\nI am thus puzzled, how is this bound significantly different?\n\n\nWith respect to B, I don't see how this bound has much to do with good representations, or even representations at all.\nIn Lemma A.1, you essentially craft a set of features that, being mutually orthogonal, are in some sense \"mutually linearly separable\", making learning the mapping from those features to a value function \"trivial\" once data is obtained. This is barely different from saying that you assume there is a magical learner that learns in O(1) given the data, because in either case, you need to visit _every_ of the 2^H state in order to solve the MDP, because by construction of your problem, there is _no hope_ of generalization*. Since learning features or creating \"good\" features has everything to do with generalization (otherwise we'd just to tabular), I don't see how this bound is relevant to representations. (We already have Wolpert's no free lunch theorem to tell us that there are always some problems that ML just can't be general enough to solve efficiently. What is more interesting is understanding how we can efficiently learn where there _is_ structure to a problem.)\n* There is no hope of generalization, unless something about the observation space (which is left undiscussed in the paper) contains *information* about the agent being to the unique path to the reward. In such a case, I can see a probabilistic argument being made where in the worst case the agent needs to visit all 2^H states, but in the average case, the agent may learn to ignore paths where it can generalize that there is no reward. This is not entirely unreasonable, think of e.g. AlphaGo, where very few states end in victory, where there is an exponential number of states in the horizon, yet learning is totally reasonable because of structure in observation. This is where I don't agree with a statement like: \"Since the class of linear functions is a strict subset of many more complicated function classes, including neural networks in particular, our negative results imply lower bounds for these more complex function classes as well.\" \n"}
