The k-NN defense mechanism identifies virtually all poisons from two state-of-the-art clean label data poisoning attacks, while only filtering a small percentage of non-poisons. The k-NN defense outperforms other simple baselines against the existing attacks\n\n1.  I am not at all familiar with clean-label attack methods, therefore no knowledge of relevant related works. \nThese papers seem to follow a pattern that : one propose an attack, and another paper proposes a defense. They do point out the potential issues on non-natural samples, however, only having results from CIFAR-10 certainly weakened the significance or the contribution of this paper. \n\n2. It does not provide good intuitions or theoretical reasons why such attacks exist and why a simple kNN based method can defend against those attacks. \n\n3. I hope the authors can provide a more thorough survey of related works. \n\n4. The experiments seems quite messy, with unfinished analysis and ill-positioned figures. \n\n5. The proposed defense showed only empirical results against the target attack. It seems to provide no theoretical / provable guarantees. "}
