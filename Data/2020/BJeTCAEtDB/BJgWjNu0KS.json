It\u2019s harder for me to precisely assess the significance of the proposed approach, but at a high level it looks reasonable and is backed by convincing empirical evidence.\n\nSmall comment: I don\u2019t believe the submission is following the ICLR 2020 format strictly: the font looks different, and the margins look tighter."}
