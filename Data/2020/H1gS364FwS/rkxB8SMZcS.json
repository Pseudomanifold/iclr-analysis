Springer, Cham\n2.\tExperimental evaluation\n2.1.\tMissing ablations\n2.1.1.\tThe paper claims \u201cAmharic presents sophisticated language-specific issues\u201d but does not evaluate how the proposed approach handles those specific challenges.\n2.1.2.\tThe authors \u201cnormalize\u201d characters with the same meaning \u201cto an ordinary conceivable form\u201d which \u201chelps the performance of [their] system\u201d; however, the paper does not ablate this benefit.\n2.2.\tThe authors \u201capplied k-fold cross- validation which split our dataset randomly into k groups\u201d. It would be great if the authors report the standard deviation across the results to understand the significant of differences.\n2.3.\tThe paper misses to show any qualitative results showing how the system works and which error it makes. \n2.4.\tThe paper notes that the \u201cAmharic has a subject-object verb agreement and other morphological feature makes cumbersome the construction of rule\u201d as well as the large unsupervised corpus they have available suggest to me that the authors should explore unsupervised pre-training a transformer-based network, such as BERT or other approaches which have successfully been used on other languages.\n3.\tClarity: The paper\u2019s clarity could be improved:\n3.1.\tOn the one hand by clearly stating the contributions and by improving the clarity of the writing throughout.\n3.2.\tIt is not clear how Table 2 relates Table 1. The authors note it is the same dataset.

Events in Amharic are ex- pressed predominantly through verbs and nominal, but, the linguistic structure and morphological richness highly matter to apply models used for other languages.\u201d\n\nConclusion:\nWhile it is interesting and valuable that this paper studies a low-resource language. The paper misses comparisons to prior work for event extraction and misses to include ablations which show the value of the introduced rules and design decisions made. \n"}
