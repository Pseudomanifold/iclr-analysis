The raw text collection is large, with 659 million words. It is not clear to me how the manual annotation for events was done, how many event types there are; I did not see a statement of inter-annotator agreement. According to Table 1, there seem to be only two classes: has event and does not have an event, but this was not clearly stated.\n\nI think the paper in its current form should be rejected from ICLR. Overall the approaches in this work are reasonable but not new. The paper is not clearly written.\n\nA new manually annotated corpus in Amharic is a good contribution. My suggestion is to submit to another venue such as LREC, focus on the new resource and include linguistic insight into the language-specific challenges, and also include machine-learned and rule-based baselines. A more modern baseline including unsupervised representation learning (i.e. multi-lingual pre-trained contextual representations) would be necessary as well.\n"}
