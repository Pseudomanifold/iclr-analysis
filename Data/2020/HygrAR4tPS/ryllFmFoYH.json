One way to achieve this rather trivially is to do a hyper-parameter search for B and then set the hyper-parameters of A so that A is simulating B.  But the point here is that direct and feasible tuning of A with dominate B even in the case where A has more hyper-parameters and where hyper-parameter optimization of A would seem to be more difficult.  An important conclusion is that without loss of generality one can always use Adam even in vision where SGD is currently the dominant optimizer used in practice.  Another important conclusion is that quasi-random hyper-parameter optimization is quite effective.\nI find the claims to be intuitively plausible and I find the empirical results compelling.\n\nJust a couple minor complaints.  First,\"Hyper-parameter\" please not \"meta-parameter\".  I find the attempt to overturn standard usage inappropriate.  Second, I found most of section 3 uninformative.  I don't think algorithm 1, or the definition of a first order optimizer adds anything to the paper.  Inclusion can be easily defined in complete generality for any parameterized algorithm."}
