This work is well-motivated, assuming that the confidence of a neural model should be lower when part of the sentence is missed. However, the application of vanilla IBP is quite limited in certain model architectures. In this work, the author considers specifically the decomposable attention model, which is a very shallow network, and not a state-of-the-art model anymore. It is non-trivial to adapt the proposed method to other more advanced models, such as the ones based on the Transformer model. Hence, this work does not make enough contribution to be accepted."}
