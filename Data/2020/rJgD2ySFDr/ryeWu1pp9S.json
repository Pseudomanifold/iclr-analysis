I could understand that the paper studies the message transformation with bandwidth-limited channels. It seems naturally the message transformation could be represented as a autoencoder model. The paper proposed variational model for this problem and it seems to me the paper employs the popular models in neural networks for example VAE, etc. Technically, what's new of this paper? Was it the auxiliary variable decoders? Is it that this class of algorithms/models firstly applied to this problem domain? To be honest the paper mentioned most of the terminologies in ML and seems that the paper wanted to connect to them, for example, ELBO, VAE, GAN, re-parameterization, etc. The paper provides experimental results on the designed model for bandwidth-limited channel."}
