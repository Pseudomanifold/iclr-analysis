The authors justify joint systems outperform their separate counterparts when coding is performed by flexible learnable function approximators. Their experiments show the advantage of their design decisions via improved distoration and FID scores.\n\nPros:\n\n1. This paper is clearly written and well-structured in logic. For example, the authors use Figures 1 and 2 assist readers to catch the difference between joint communication system and separate communication system.\n\n2. This paper gives a reliazation of joint source-channel coding, especially to give auxilary latent variable decoders.\n\n3. This paper has been verified in both Gaussian channel and bandwidth-limited channel. The empirical results show the advantage of joint coding.\n\nCons:\n\n1. Intuitively, you Section 4.3 should be better than Section 4.2. However, I don't see any difference or major items to justify this kind of benefits. Could you please explain why techniques in Section 4.3 can outperform these in Section 4.2.\n\n2. Although the authors verified their work on CelebA, it seems that the proposed method has very limited applications. If possible, the authors should do more datasets to verify their proposed method, which will be more useful to boarder readers."}
