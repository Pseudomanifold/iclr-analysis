To compare, when weights in deep linear networks are initialized with Gaussian initialization, the minimal width required for convergence will depend on the depth of the network. This proof explains why orthogonal weight initialization can help to train networks efficiently, especially for those very deep ones.\n\nThe theoretical contribution of this paper is very important. Orthogonal initialization is found to be useful in deep network training. Although the theory in this paper is developed for linear networks, it still has important guidance meaning in practices in more areas of deep learning. The derivations are correct to my best knowledge. And the paper is well-written and easy to read.\n\nMinor points:\n- typo in the last equation in (4)"}
