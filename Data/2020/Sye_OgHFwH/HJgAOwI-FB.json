To these end, the paper employes another parametrized colorization techniques (and texture transfer method) and proposes optimization objectives for finding adversarial examples with respect to each semantic technique. Experimental results show that the proposed methods are more robust on existing defense methods and more transferrable accross models. The paper also performs a user study to show that the generated examples are fairly imperceptible like the C&W attack. \n\nIn overall, I agree that seeking a new way of attack is important, and the methods are clearly presented to claim a new message to the community: adversarial examples can be even found by exploiting semantic features that humans also utilize, since DNNs tend to overly-utilize them, e.g. colors. These claims are supported by the experiments showing that the generated examples are more transferrable across robust classifiers. Personally, I liked the idea of using another colorization method to design cAdv and the use of K-means clustering to control the imperceptibility. \n\n- Some readers may wonder how the \"averaged-case\" corruption robustness behave for both cAdv and sAdv, e.g. considering random colorization. Would it be worse than the robustness on Gaussian noise?\n- One of my concerns on tAdv is whether the texture added is indeed effective to reduce the accuracy, or its just from the (yet small) beta term in the objective. Adding an ablation of beta=0 case in the result would much help the understanding of the method. \n- Eq 1: I think F should denote the classifier to attack, but the description tells it's the colorization network. As it seems to me that theta is nevertheless for the colorization network, I feel the notation should be refined for better understanding to the readers."}
