In order to make manipulated images photo-realistic, colors to be replaced are chosen by energy values, while textures are replaced with style-transfer technique.\n\nThe paper is written clearly and organized well to understand. The graphs and equations are properly shown. The idea of using color replacement and texture transfer is interesting and novel.\n\nA somewhat weakness is that the discriminator - a pretrained ResNet 50 - is too weak for this scenario. What about a ResNet 50 trained on augmented datasets with color jittering?\nWhat about finetuned ResNet 50 with taking color channel as explicit input, since the attack uses this additional info.\n\nAs tAdv attack seems to manipulate high frequency texture of images, how about applying a Gaussian filter on the images and feed into the discrimimator again? Is that attack still effective or not?"}
