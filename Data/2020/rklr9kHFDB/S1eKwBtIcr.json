The design of these features is funded by the observation that specific ganglion cell types have rotation and scale invariant responses to visual stimuli. \nThe method is very clearly explained and the evaluation on an publicly available dataset looks promising. The clustering Figure 6 in particular is very insightful. \nThe paper could have been more impactful if a comparison with a ground truth was built. The issue is clearly that ground truth is hard to establish for this type of problems but biological observations and annotations of cell types can be available (unfortunately not public as far as I know). \nI would also be curious to know how such a method can be applied to a blind patient whose retina does not react to visual stimuli. Is there a biological function that will still preserve such invariance properties which allow to find structure in the data?"}
