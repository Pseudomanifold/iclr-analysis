The neighborhood attribute distribution of a node is considered in both a pooled and a multi-scale way. The multi-scale embedding approach considers the neighborhood nodes with different distance to the interested node distinctly, providing more flexibilities to the model. Then, the paper proved theoretically that the proposed embedding methods, both the pooled and multi-scale versions, can be equivalently written the factorization of a node-feature pointwise mutual information matrix.\n\nThe proposed embedding methods are standard. The key contribution of this paper comes from the theoretical part, which establishes the equivalence between the proposed embedding methods and matrix factorization. It looks interesting, although there are several similar works before, as mentioned in the paper. I don\u2019t know how different your work is from the Qiu\u2019s paper.\n\nThe experimental results are not convincing. The node classification is a very standard task in the performance evaluation of network embedding, but you put the results into the appendix. I examine the results anyway, and I found the performance gain is very limited, and on some datasets, the proposed methods even perform inferiorly.\n"}
