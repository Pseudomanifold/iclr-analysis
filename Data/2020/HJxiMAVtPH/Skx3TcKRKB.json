Algorithm 1 and 2 shows that in fact they propagate randomly selected node features to neighbors. The reviewer doesn\u2019t think this random-walk way for selecting node feature is appropriate.  Node features describe node content. The features of neighboring nodes may complement each other. However, there is no benefit to select random features and then propagate, given that there already many approaches smartly combining node content in neighborhood. \n\nThe proof part follows Qiu et al (2018). But it is unclear, why c^{\u22121}A is the stationary joint distribution over consecutive nodes p(wj , wj+1).  and c^{\u22121}DF describes the stationary joint distribution p(f,wj) over nodes and features. There needs more explanation. \n\nThe Remark 1 and 2 discuss the case AE with F=I_|V|,  which is in fact the case when there is no node attributes. In this case, the AE process naturally goes back to plain network embedding, where DeepWalk and WalkLets are proposed for. Therefore, these remarks are done by Qiu et al (2018) already, not make no much new contribution here. \n\nFigure 2 shows that the presented two approaches just slightly better or equivalent, or sometimes worse than baseline methods. As mentioned earlier, it is not beneficial to randomly select features to propagate. \n\nThe experiments presented in Section 5.2 evaluate whether the learned embedding can be used for label inference in a different graph. But it is unknown how success the transferring is. There is no F1-score of a solution that does embedding of the target network itself independently, and then classify the target network nodes. \n"}
