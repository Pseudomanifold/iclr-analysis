It points out an analysis error in a previous paper and gives the correct proof. The analyses are based on two sampling schemes, i.i.d. and Markovian.  Convergence guarantees and convergence rates are provided for both sampling schemes. \n\nThe paper is well written. The main theoretical results are presented clearly. The convergence rates are reasonable to me. Considering the importance of TD, I think this analysis will provide some insights for future directions of TD. \n\nI have several questions and concerns. \n1. The data is simulated. I am wondering how VRTD works in practice comparing to naive TD. \n2. The number of gradient evaluations is used in x-axis in the experimental results. What if it's replaced by wall-clock time?"}
