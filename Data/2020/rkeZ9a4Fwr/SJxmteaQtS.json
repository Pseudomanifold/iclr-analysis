Inspired by beta-TCVAE, DLGM, and BIVA, seatbelt-VAE allows multiple latent layers, enforce disentanglement via weighted total correlation on the top latent layer, and conditions the likelihood on all latent layers. Robustness to adversarial attacks is the focus in experiments. Visual and quantitative comparisons show that seatbelt-VAE is more robust for latent attack than benchmarks. Specifically I have the following three concerns:\n\n1. Defining ELBO using samples from the entire dataset may bring in some benefits, but it complicates the calculation of ELBO and related distributions when minibatch or single sample are used in learning and inference. Please explicitly discuss this issue.\n\n2. I would like to see how seatbelt-VAE performs in sampling and generating new samples, instead of just reconstruction. \n\n3. Similarly, it would be beneficial to investigate disentanglement, that is the interpretation of the top latent factors in seatbelt-VAE. \n\nMinors: \nFactor analysis -> factor analysis\nsection X -> Section X\nfigure X -> Figure X\n"}
