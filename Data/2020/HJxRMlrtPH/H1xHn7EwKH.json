The specific case of restricting the inputs to a line segment allows performing verification of robustness exactly (Exact-line approach, NeurIPS'19). The authors extend this work and apply it to verify robustness of some VAE and BEGAN like models.\n\nPositive aspects:\n- Rigorous work, I did not spot much typos.\u00a0\n- First proofs given for generative models.\n\nNegative aspects:\n\nMy main concern about this work is that the presentation is not didactic enough. \n- From the beginning, key concepts are not clearly defined, such as network certification, specification, and the \"verification problem\". In the definition of robustness, a reference to a \"safe set of outputs\", as in Gehr et al. would help the understanding.\n- The introduction is too short and lacks context. Figure 1 is not referred\u00a0in the text and is not understandable with notations that are not yet introduced.\u00a0\n- Then follows without transition two pages of background that are mostly definitions but without\u00a0a proper motivation, these are difficult to process.\n- The work, an extension of the Exact-line approach, only gives a 5 lines description which is not insufficient to understand the approach.\u00a0\n\nPerhaps my assessment is too negative because I am unfamiliar with the certification literature, but since the work present applications in generative modeling, I think it should be understandable by readers from this background as well.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\nMinor:\nof of in caption of Fig 2\nlast line of page 5: J -> j\nI found the equivalence sign in the last equation of page 6 confusing, is it really supposed to be an equivalence here?\u00a0\nPage 6 : attribute detector... described below -> in appendix\n"}
