The purpose of the new design is to make the network easier to analyze using the existing Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solvers. An easier analysis is preferable since the SAT solver can be used to infer existing fragility in the network, e.g., adversarial attacks. Empirically, the proposed design of BNN is shown to outperform traditional BNNs by a large margin in terms of detecting adversarial attacks. \n\nOverall, this paper seems to provide a solid contribution to the design of robust BNNs. I like how the authors tried to address various aspects of the networks for easy analysis of SAT solver, i.e., neuron, block, and network-levels even though they only focused on changing the architecture in neuron-level perspective. The experimental results seem to show benefits without any compromise in performance. \n\n"}
