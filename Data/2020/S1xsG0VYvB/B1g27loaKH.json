The paper is novel and addresses an interesting\nquestion.\n\nThe paper follows Dale's law and has separate populations of E and I\ncells.  The cells differ in proportion (4 times more E cells) and in\nprojection patterns (E cells project to the next layer).  From these\nconstraints they found that some of the other observed differences\nbetween E and I cells developed, specifically greater selectivity of E\ncells and greater connectivity of I cells.\n\nBoth subtractive and divisive inhibition are modeled in the Standard model.\n\nThrough careful controls, they show that increased selectivity of E\nneurons depends on having a lot of E neurons (but there was not a\ncorresponding effect for I neurons).  Likewise the sparse connectivity\nof E neurons was due to a large number of E neurons.  They also showed\nthat being projection neurons was more important than being E cells\nfor strong selectivity.  Finally networks without Dale's law imposed\nperform slightly better.\n\nThese are all interesting findings that will benefit the field of\nneuroscience but may also lead to insights for the next architecture\nboost to improve deep learning.  I am in favor of acceptance.\n\n\n\n"}
