In experiments, the authors compare the rate-distortion curves for VAEs and GANs and discuss the properties of rate-distortion curves.\n\nThe method for computing the rate-distortion curves of deep generative models is interesting and the rate-prior distortion curve is promising as a performance measure. However, the main technical contribution of this work is the estimated AIS rate-prior distortion curve and it is based on a straight-forward application of AIS. \n\nIn fact, Sections 2 and 3 discuss already known result in literature although summarizing them in a paper is nice for readers.\n\nAlthough the findings in the experiments are interesting and insightful, they are still preliminary and further investigations are desirable.\n\nIn Section 5, the authors mention the consistency of their framework with Shannon\u2019s rate distortion theorem. This seems to be a little overstatement because the authors discuss little about the optimization of the prior p(z).\n\n"}
