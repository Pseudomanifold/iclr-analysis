Although Transformer has revolutionized the field of NLP, many small groups cannot make a full use of it due to lack of necessary computational resources. As such, it is very important to improve the space and computational complexity of this popular deep model. The techniques presented in this manuscript seem to be very reasonable and the experimental results also indicate that they are effective. My major concern is that the authors shall present more detailed experimental results. In addition to bits per dim, it will also better if the authors can evaluate the performance in terms of other metrics. "}
