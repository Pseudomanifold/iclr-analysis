They choose a specific way (mentioned above). I think the most interesting part would be the CWA method which achieves the normalization. \n\nThey have a fair list of literature in spiking neural networks. But I find the way they illustrate the difference between their model and other models is insufficient. They should focus on the model-wise difference, instead of focusing on whether it\u2019s applied to MNIST or not or what\u2019s the accuracy. \n\nThey don\u2019t include any other SNN model in the paper for experimental comparison. They also mention a few SNN works that work well on MNIST in the related work section which actually have better accuracies than their model. So it is inappropriate to say this proposed method is a state-of-art neuro-inspired method, Because others perform well on MNIST as well, and their limited experiments only investigate MNIST and CIFAR-10, which are less interesting generally. \n\nCWA cannot outperform Affine+BN. \n\nOverall, the idea is somehow interesting, but the experiments are weak. Applying the method to MNIST and CIFAR-10 is far from being called either \u201cinteresting computer vision applications\u201d or \u201cdifficult perceptual tasks\u201d. They only use perceptual in the title, but the applications are MNIST and CIFAR-10. It feels like they want to learn something big, but they only focus on benchmark datasets. \n\nThey compare nothing with other SNN type of model on other truly difficult perceptual tasks.\n"}
