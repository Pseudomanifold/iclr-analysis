By leveraging subjective Logic, they propose to decompose the entropy of a predicted class distribution into vacuity (lack of evidence) and dissonance (conflict of strong evidence). Instead of using the predicted class distribution, they estimate the supporting evidence for each class. In the actual data sampling stage, they first sample from those high-vacuity dense region, to shape the true decision boundary, and then gradually sample from those high-dissonance region to fine-tune the decision boundary. They show better performance than the baselines on both synthetic and real datasets. \n\nFirst of all, for the readers who are not familiar with Subjective Logic or probabilistic logic in general, it is a bit hard to follow the reasoning behind the  equations in Sec 3 and  4. Specifically, what is the intuition behind the dissonance of an opinion in Eq (6)? What is the advantage of using Subjective logic framework. \n\nIn the experiments on MNIST, it would be best to visualize the image samples selected by the active learning model in the early and later stages, so that we can have a more intuitive understanding of vacuity vs. dissonance.
