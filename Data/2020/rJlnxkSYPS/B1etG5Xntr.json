The method first trains an ensemble of clustering models and use the edge-level majority vote to determine a graph, and then applies rule to get partial clustering signals to feed the final semi-supervised clustering. The scheme is in an iterative fashion to further enhance the quality. I find this paper interesting and somewhat novel, with the following comments.\n\n1. In algorithm 1, is it possible that too many nodes are removed so one cannot get k clusters in the end? Though finding cliques are time consuming, have the authors conducted experiments to see the difference between the real clique finding algorithm and the greedy one proposed?\n\n2. Does the ensemble clustering step have stability issue regarding the method used? If a different clustering method is used, will the graph constructed later change drastically?\n\n3. The writing. First line of section 3, figure 4 seems to point to figure 1. Section 2 seems to have format issue at the beginning. Section 5 could be merged with section 2."}
