Unlike most other NAS works that search for exact network structures, this paper aims to search for the random graph distribution with graphon. Overall, it provides some new angles for NAS search space design, but the experimental results are very weak.\n\n1.  It simply ignore all other NAS works and just compares with the baseline DenseNet and random deletion/walk (WS-G). Despite that, the gain (accuracy +0.17% than DenseNet baseline) is very marginal compared to other approaches:  random-wire (accuracy +2% than resent50 baseline), FBNet (accuracy +2% than MobileNetv2 baseline).\n2. According to Section 5.1, the search is performed on CIFAR-10, but there is no evaluation on CIFAR-10 at all. The only results are reported for ImageNet instead, which is kind of strange.\n\nGiven these weak results, I cannot accept this paper in the current form."}
