The authors identify keywords related to agriculture and build a model that can automatically detect these keywords of interest. Their contribution is the proposed model relies on relatively simple neural networks (15-layer 1-D CNNs) to achieve keyword detection of low resourced language (e.g., Luganda). Therefore, they are capable of monitoring food security concerns in rural areas.\n\nThis paper should be rejected because (1) no novel algorithm is proposed and only straightforward solution is used (2) the paper never clearly demonstrates the existence of problem they are trying to solve, (3) the experiments are difficult to understand and missing many details, and (4) the paper is incomplete and unpolished.\n\nMain argument\nThe paper does not do a great job of demonstrating that current model development and drawbacks of dealing with low resourced language (e.g., Luganda). They said they solve the problem by the Keywords Spotting system (KWS), but they did not give a comprehensive review of the current progress of KWS. For example, they should include and compare with the paper, called \u201cSpeech recognition and keyword spotting for low-resource languages: Babel Project Research at CUED\u201d by Dr. Mark Gales.\n\nWhen it comes to methodology, the authors use unnecessary pages to describe how they collect Luganda audios and keyword dataset. It would be appropriate to illustrate their data flow or detection pipeline instead of irrelevant engineering details. In addition, SIAMESE CNN is used to compare performance, but the authors use a relatively large portion of the paper to explain its architecture. Did their method developed beyond SIAMESE CNN? Otherwise, it would be inappropriate to describe it in methodology and model design. For the 1D convolution model, the model is demonstrated in an extremely simple way. They did not even mention their target data (Y), please clarify it in detail.\nThe experiment did not provide convincing evidence of the utility of the proposed method (1-D convolution). They only demonstrated results in 1 dataset, which did not indicate the effectiveness of the model. There are so many missing details. How many times the experiment they did? How much size is an audio file? Why 1d-conv show the same values of accuracy, precision, and recall? What\u2019s the model drawn in Figure 1? The paper lacks complete discussion on their empirical results. We did not know how to interpret their results.\n\nConsidering the above, there are many drawbacks to the paper. The paper seems incomplete. Therefore, we highly recommend rejecting the paper.\n"}
