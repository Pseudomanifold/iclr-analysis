But, it is difficult to obtain realistic underwater images, thus this paper introduces a GAN-based method to generate realistic underwater images from in-air image and depth map pairs.\n\n- Although this paper points out that the previous work (i.e. WaterGAN) generates color noise and the camera model is not suitable, how does this proposed method overcome these points? Please make it clear.\n\n- The figures in this paper are too blurry to see them. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, the figures are important, thus, it would be better to make them clear.\n\n- The technical contribution of the proposed method is not clear. The proposed method seems to be just using the existing techniques."}
