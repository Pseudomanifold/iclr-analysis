However, many existing works used the physical model to represent the imaging principles and using deep network to learn prior knowledge. Thus, I think the proposed idea is a little bit incremental.\n\nFor the experimental part, the experimental results fully demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in comparison with state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, the ablation studies in the appendix also give us the intuition by using the different loss functions. Also, I suggest the authors demonstrate the proposed method on not only low-level, but also high-level vision tasks, e.g., underwater image target detection. \n\nFinally, the paper is well organized and sentence expression is also clear, but small errors that are correctable. \n"}
