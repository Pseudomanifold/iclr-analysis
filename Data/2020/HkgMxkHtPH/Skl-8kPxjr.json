Then, a U-Net was leveraged to enhance the results. \nHowever, the text suffers from too many language problems. The authors should consult professional proofreading services. As a courtesy towards referees, the quality of writing needs meticulous attention before a scientific paper should be submitted. \n\tOther comments:\n1.\tThe literature is limited. I found some novel works being done in the field that must be addressed and listed in the background and experiments.\n2.\tThe underwater imaging model presented in this paper derives from the Jaffe-McGlamery model, which is a common sense in this field. The authors use a generator to produce underwater images that only implements the common model by a neural network. Moreover, the statement of section 2.2 is not clear. Please rewrite this section.\n3.\tThe authors used U-Net without any improvement to enhance the results generated from UWGAN, which is the integration of existing models. \n4.\tThe authors claimed that their model is better than others, while there is no evidence to indicates that. For example, 1) in (page 5, line 4 from bottom), \u201cIt can be seen that our proposed method has achieved a higher score.\u201d, can we observe this from the Table 1 and 2? 2) \u201cThe method we proposed has the fastest processing speed compared to other methods. Moreover, the method proposed in this paper has the fewest parameters compared to other deep-learning-based methods.\u201d, it is suggested that a study about the parameters and FLOPs of the involved methods should be given.\n5.\tPlease carefully check the references. For example, \u201cHummel R. Image enhancement by histogram transformation[J]. Unknown, 1975.\u201d lacks the journal name.\n6.\tHigh-resolution figures should be given in the manuscript.\n", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I assessed the sensibility of the derivations and theory."}
