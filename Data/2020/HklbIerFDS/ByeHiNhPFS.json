I believe you are over using fast vs slow and under using small vs large, complex vs simple, specific vs general. \n\nIt is not clear to me that your manually directing task data into a special FL is not the whole source of your positive results. \n\nI would like to know more about the size of FL memory needed for good results vs the task complexity and size. \n\nI do not see anything wrong I just do not see anything compelling.
