The experiment setup, depth, and breadth are particularly convincing. I see no reason to not accept this paper.\n\nRemarks:\n- It should be clearly stated which languages feature in the paper. From what I gather, it's only English. How does the method generalize to other languages? How does it scale with (the lack of) resources?"}
