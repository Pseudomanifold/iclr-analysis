The author first proposed an efficient segmentation network. Then a semi-supervised learning scheme with an auxiliary network is introduced to annotate the unlabeled images thus help boost the segmentation accuracy.\n\nClarity:\nThere is no novelty for the proposed fast segmentation network detailed in Sec 3.2. The auxiliary network for predicting the confidence map may look interesting, while the experimental results are not convincing.\n\nExperiments:\n1. The design of the fast segmentation network in this paper is boring and not much related to the title.\n\n2. The experimental results regarding the effectiveness of the auxiliary network are based on a weak backbone, some stronger backbones like DeepLab and PSPNet should be included.\n\n3. What the results would be if using all labeled data and the newly added unlabeled data? Can the newly unlabeled data with labels from the auxiliary network help boosting the performance?\n"}
