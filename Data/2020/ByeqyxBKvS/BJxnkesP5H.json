The motivation is to utilise the significant advantage of quantum computation to train machine learning models on large-scale datasets efficiently. This paper reviews the existing work on using quantum computing for least-squares svm (via solving quantum linear systems of equations) and then extends it to deal with kernel svm in a semi-supervised setting. \n\nStrengths: This is an interesting emerging research topic that has its significance. Also, this paper prodives a nice tutorial on the key ideas of quantum machine learning and provides detailed derivations and analysis on the proposed algorithm.\n\nWeaknesses: The novelty of this work seems to be incremental. It largely extends the existing algorithms such as HHL and LMR. \n\nMinor issues:\n\n1. Can any experimental study or applications be demonstrated, or only theoretical comptuational complexity can be compared? \n2. In Section 1.1, L is defined as L = G_I G^T_I. In this definition, whether and how the edge weights are considered? Please clarify.   "}
