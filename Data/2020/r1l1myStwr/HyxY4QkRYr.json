Different from the traditional offline meta-learning phase with explicit task segmentation, MOCA adopts a Bayesian changepoint estimation scheme for task change detection. The setting is novel and deserves research in-depth, and the idea is easy to understand. The proposed method can learn the meta-learning model and changepoint detection model simultaneously. Besides, the MOCA framework is not designed specifically for one algorithm and can be easily combined with other meta-learning models.\n\nHowever, I got some questions about this paper:\nQ1: Is the \u2018Hazard\u2019 in the experiment the same to $\\lambda$ in eq.1? I think notations should be consistent if they are the same.\nQ2: Can other changepoint models be compared in the experiment? I found many in the related work.\nQ3: The running times in Figure 2 should be reported to demonstrate the efficiency of MOCA, since the method is proposing online streams, efficiency should be promised for quickly processing.\nQ4: What is \u2018T\u2019 in Algorithm 1? Are experiment results sensitive to it? Experiments about this should be conducted and reported.\n\nLastly, I think [1] should be cited as related work about continual learning for proposing task-free continual learning, which is very similar to the setting in this paper.\n[1] Rahaf Aljundi, Klaas Kelchtermans, Tinne Tuytelaars.
