However, it is not easy to read.\n\n- Section 4.2 is completely obscure. I do not see any importance sampling any weights etc.\nPlease clarify. \n\n- Can you also apply a Multiple Importance Sampling scheme or a Generalized  Multiple Importance Sampling scheme in your method? please discuss.\n\n- Maybe the following paper is related with your work:\n\nL. Martino, V. Elvira, \"Compressed Monte Carlo for Distributed Bayesian Inference\", viXra:1811.0505, 2018.\n\nPlease discuss relationships, differences and possible use in your setup.\n\n- In Section 4.4 you refer to an online scheme, maybe you must use a sequential importance sampling scheme there. Please discuss. \n"}
