The proposed metrics are tried on language GANs but fail to produce any improvement.\n\nMajor issues:\n\nThis manuscript is poorly organized and the introduction is not well-written. It\u2019s true that generating text from random noise vector remains a challenging problem, but sequence-to-sequence models for machine translation and question answering have achieved tremendous successes. The description in the first paragraph about neural language models is not accurate. \n\nThere are numerous grammar issues and mis-spellings. For e.g., pp. 1: \u201cRelGAN which needs not...\u201d, pp. 2: \u201cWe analysis\u2026\u201d, \u201ccould be find\u2026\u201d, pp 3: \u201cequation 8\u201d should be \u201cequation 9\u201d...\n\nThe proposed metrics are also questionable. Eq. 3 on page 2 holds for any x sampled from the distribution, not just for a single data point. To test the effectiveness of a good metric, extensive experiments on toy datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR10, and synthetic datasets should be conducted. This paper mixes text generation and proposed metrics together. The claimed failure experiments make the proposed metrics even more questionable.\n\nIn summary, the presentation and the organization of this paper should be significantly improved for submission. The proposed metrics are questionable and should be thoroughly tested on synthetic and toy datasets before deploying it for text generation.", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I assessed the sensibility of the derivations and theory."}
