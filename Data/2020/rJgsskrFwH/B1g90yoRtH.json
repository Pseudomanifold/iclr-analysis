It generalizes the Transformer architecture of Vaswani et al. (2017) to spatiotemporal data (video). The original Transform implies self-attention among different words in a sentence. Considering the larger scale of video, this work proposes to divide it into small blocks, and apply the self-attention (part of block-local self-attention modular) on each block. At the same time, it addresses the information exchange between blocks problem, by spatiotemporal sub-scaling (described in section 3.2). The proposed method achieves competitive results across multiple metrics on popular benchmark datasets (BAIR Robot Pushing and KINETICS), for which they produce continuations of high fidelity.\n\nSome questions:\n-      The proposed model is claimed to work on competitive results across multiple metrics on popular benchmark datasets. However, it only compares with stat-of-the-art models on BAIR Robot Pushing dataset (for the other dataset, the author only compares with the variations of the proposed model). Further, the author only reports the result of Bits/dim and FVD, instead of PSNR and SSIM, which are reported in the original papers. Any justification for this? Though FVD has its own advantages, showing PSNR and/or SSIM at the same time would help us get better sense of the performance. \n-      In table 1 (left) in section 4.2, the author mentions that results from all the stat-of-the-art models are not strictly comparable, since prior works use longer priming sequences of two or three frames, whereas the proposed models only observe a single prime frame. I am confused of why the proposed model can only see a single frame.\n-      The proposed block-local self-attention modular works on divideding video into small blocks, which seems to be a matrix of 3 or 4 dimensions (t,h,w,c). However, in the experiment, the input of the model for the BAIR Robot Pushing dataset is the first frame. How can this frame be feed into the block-local self-attention modular?\n-     In section 3.3, it splits the 3x8-bit RGB channel into 6x4-bit channels. It would be better if the author can show an example and clarify the advantages.\n-     In section 3.3, U_k, N_v and P seems not defined in the context.\n-    Videos are divided into small blocks and feed into the block-local self-attention modular separately. Then, I\u2019m confused on how to aggregate these different blocks together to predict future frames.\n\nI would like to raise up my score if the author can address my questions.\n"}
