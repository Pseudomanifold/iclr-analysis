The motivation of this combination is supported by two analysis on the feature/label smoothing and feature/label influence. The proposed GCN-LPA framework utilizeds LPA to adjust the edge weight A* through the label information. Then, this edge weight A* is used to transfer the knowledge from label information to feature information for enhancing the representation learning in GCN. An end-to-end  solution is proposed by treating the LPA process as regularization. Overall, the idea of unifying GCNs and LAP in an end-to-end fashion is interesting. \n\nOne major concern is that from the experiment, it is unclear how much the LPA impacts the node classification. It will be more convincing if the performance comparison under different percentage of labeled samples (during LPA) is provided. \n"}
