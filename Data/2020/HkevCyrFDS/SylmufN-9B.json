It would be good to provide video supplementary materials for generated videos. From the generated images,\nIt is hard to compare the performance with RecycleGAN.\nC. The interpolation loss is not very innovative, it is a light variation of recycle loss in RecycleGAN.\nD. Typos are quite a few, for example, in figure. 1: translatier...\nE. Please help re-examine the equation. Why in the optimization procedure, minimizing the discriminator\nloss.\n"}
