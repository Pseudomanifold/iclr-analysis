The idea is to unify the annotation aggregation and model training whilst modelling the sample annotation difficulty and annotator competency level. The experiments on five datasets show improvements over a number of baselines.\n\nThis is a solid piece work that deals with a very practical problem \u2013 training ML models with crowdsourced data with imperfect annotations. The proposed method is not completely new: many ideas have been adopted from previous works. However putting everything together seems to work as demonstrated by the experiments.\n\nI have a number of concerns:\n\n1, One of the main claimed novelties of the paper is an \u201cend-to-end\u201d approach that unifies ground truth label prediction and label aggregation. However there is no ablation study to show that this is indeed better than a two-stepped variant with everything else remaining the same. \n\n2, The authors made a claim on the ability to estimate the quality of the annotator. But the statement is the Introduction is misleading \u2013 it suggests that the attributes of the annotator such as age and gender will be used as input to the estimator, but later it is clear that no benchmarks contain that information hence it is not implemented. Also it is not clear how this vector embedding (Sec. 3.2) is implemented. Any evidence that this embedding is indeed a clustering index?\n\n3, In the implementation, the strong BERT model was used for language but VGG was used for image representation. Stronger CNN feature extractors such as ResNet101 should be used. \n\n4, In general, the lack of any ablation study is a problem for analysing why the model works.  \n"}
