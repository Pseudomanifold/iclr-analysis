The proposed model is able to explore the neighborhood structure of each node, by using the curvature of edges in the proposed framework. Extensive experimental results show the efficacy of the proposed framework. I am not familiar with graph curvature. All I can say is the approach is intuitively appealing, the text is well written and easy to follow, even for an outsider. However, I do not know any related works or what to expect from the results. I could not find anything wrong with this paper, but also do not have any intelligent questions to ask.\n"}
