The Ricci curvature can measure the connectivity around an edge. The higher Ricci curvature, the denser connections there. This is very important information especially for extracting hidden clusters in the graph. The proposed curvature driven graph convolution network shows good experimental results on theoretical synthetic data sets and real world benchmark data sets. \n\nI recommend \u201cweak accept\u201d to this paper since this paper proposes an interesting concept and it looks promising.\n\nPros. \n\nThe authors introduce a very useful metric \u201cRicci curvature\u201d \n\nCurvGN-1 and CurvGN-2 outperforms existing graph convolution algorithms.\n\nCons.\n\nTo run the proposed algorithm, we have to compute the Ricci curvature values for all edges. This can increase the inference time significantly. The authors should discuss the inference time and check it with a proper experiment."}
