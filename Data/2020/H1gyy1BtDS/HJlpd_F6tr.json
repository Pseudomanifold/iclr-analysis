They studied this problem from information-theoretic point of view. Their main contribution can be summarized as follows.\n    1. The optimal trade-off between the accuracy and complexity were studied for discrete memoryless data model as well as memoryless vector Gaussian model.\n    2. A variational bound were constructed in order to connect the optimal encoder and decoder mappings with the solution of an optimization algorithm.\n    3. If only samples from an unknown distribution are available, an algorithm were proposed to find the optimal encode and decoder. Moreover, some experiment were conducted to support the approach.\n\nIn general, I think the paper is well-organized. The definition of the problem and the motivation of the approach are clear. The theorems, algorithms and experiments are solid enough to support the whole story of this paper. Generally I wish to see  this paper being accepted."}
