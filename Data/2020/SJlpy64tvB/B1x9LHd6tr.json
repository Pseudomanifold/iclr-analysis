The authors start from one of the state-of-the-art episodic memory based continual learning method, A-GEM. The proposed method, Gradient Reversion (GREV), is specialized on A-GEM. The method perturbed the episodic memory examples on A-GEM, thus modifies the direction of reference gradient. While conventional attack like Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) hardly show the their influence on A-GEM, GREV significantly attacks the performance.\n\n\nThe paper is well written, and easy to follow. Also, attack technique on episodic memory based continual learning is interesting and would be valuable. \n\nBut, I feel that some of the analysis are obvious which are not much meaningful to analyze the model,  and the overall contributions are suggested under A-GEM model, while not to cover generic other episodic-based continual learning. \n\nSo, I hesitate to give the high score even the approach is interesting.\n\nAdditional one question.\nI didn't get the concrete reasons that A-GEM is already robust for famous attack methods. What\u2019s the reason that A-GEM is robust for them?\n"}
