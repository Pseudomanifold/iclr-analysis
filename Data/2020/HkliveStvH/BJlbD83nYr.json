The algorithms described build a graph on superpixels and do not require deep features or labels but rely on \u201cscribbles\u201d for supervision.  Given that semantic (and panoptic) annotation is very labor-intensive, advances in scribble-based annotation could significantly improve annotation time for new datasets; in applications where real-time performance is not required, scribble-based refinement of predictions could also be advantageous.\n\nThe experiments compare the proposed algorithms to deep baselines for VOC2012 and Cityscapes panoptic segmentation, and show impressive performance even without deep features. However they do not compare results to other scribble supervision methods to highlight the advantages of their approach over prior work.  I\u2019d like for the experiments section to have a proper comparison to prior scribble algorithms (e.g. in section 4.4, comparing to other algorithms with the SOTA approach as baseline) to clearly show the advantage of their approach.\n\nThe results are impressive compared to the deep learning baseline, but I think further experimental validation should exist for properly comparing to prior work."}
