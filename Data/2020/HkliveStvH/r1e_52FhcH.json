The proposed methods rely on (i) a discrete Potts model making use of RGB or DCNN features of the image, as well as the edge connectivity in a superpixel graph, and (ii) an integer linear program corresponding to a MRF with a pairwise data term. The proposed methods are evaluated on the Pascal VOC 2012 and Cityscapes datasets.\n\nThe paper is generally well written and easy to follow. The problem of panoptic segmentation is fundamental to computer vision, and as such, of relevance to the ICLR community. The proposed methods appear novel and worth pursuing.\n\nA first reservation about the paper is that the method is primarily one of post-processing (after, e.g., extracting primary features from a DCNN), but the most common means of post-processing, namely conditional random fields, are not even mentioned, let alone compared against.\n\nThe other main reservation about the paper is that there are very few comparisons to the abundant literatures on either semantic or instance segmentation, and as such it is difficult to appreciate the paper\u2019s contributions to these areas. Of note:\n\n1. Evaluate on the COCO dataset, which is the current standard for segmentation ;\n2. The scribble supervision method of Lin et al (2016) is mentioned, but not compared against.\n\nSeparately, the paper should compare the proposed method for semantic and instance segmentation with other methods that use weak-labels such as:\n* Laradji, I.

As such, the paper would require more work before recommending acceptance at ICLR."}
