The main idea is to use a tree-based autoencoder to embed text data into the continuous vector space and then optimize to find the adversarial perturbation in the vector space. The authors consider two types of attacks: concat attack and scatter attack. Experimental results on sentiment analysis and question answering, together with human evaluation on the generated adversarial text, are provided. \n\nOverall, this paper has a nice idea: use tree autocoders to embed text into vector space and perform optimization in the vector space. On the other hand, it is not clear to me why the proposed method would not change the ground truth answer for QA. Currently the authors claim to achieve this by carefully choosing the initial sentence as the initial point of optimization, which seems a bit heuristic. The authors could add more discussion on this and more experimental results to justify this claim. "}
