Different generation strategies of perturbing latent embeddings at sentence level or masked word level are both explored. Adversarial text generation can take either a form of appending an adversarial sentence or a form of scattering adversarial words into different specified positions. Experiments on both sentiment classification and question answering show that the proposed attack framework outperforms some baselines. Human evaluations are also conducted.\n\nPros: \n\nThis paper is well-written overall. Extensive experiments are performed.\n\nMany human studies comparing different adversarial text generation strategies and evaluating adversarial text for sentiment classification/question answering are conducted.\n\nCons:\n\n1) Although the studied problem in this paper is interesting, the technical innovation is very limited. All the techniques are standard or known. \n\n2) There are two major issues: lacking a rigorous metric of human unnoticeability and lacking justification of the advantage of the tree-based autoencoder. I think the first issue is a major problem that renders all the claims in this paper questionable. The metrics used to define adversarial images for deep CNN classifiers are indeed valid and produce unnoticeable images for human observers. But in this paper, the adversarial attack is performed in the latent embedding space, and there is no explicit constraint enforced on the output text. It\u2019s unconvincing that this approach will generate adversarial text that seems negligible to humans. Therefore, the studied problem in this paper has a completely different nature from the one for CNN image classifiers and it is hard to convince readers that the proposed  framework generates adversarial text legitimate to human readers. \n\n3) It is unclear why tree-structured LSTM instead of a standard LSTM/GRU should be chosen in this framework for adversarial text generation. If this architecture is preferred, sufficient ablation studies should be conducted.\n\n4) In section 3.3, the description about adversarial attacks at word level is unclear. More detailed loss function and algorithms along with equations should be provided.\n\n5) In section 5.2, it is unclear that the majority answers on the adversarial text will, respectively, match the majority answers on the original text. Moreover, it seems that there is a large performance drop from original text to adversarial text. Therefore, it is valid to argue that whether the proposed framework can generate legitimate adversarial text to human readers or not.\n\n6) It\u2019s better to include many examples of generated adversarial text in the appendix.\n\n7) Missing training details: It is unclear how the model architectures are chosen, and learning rate, optimizer, training epochs etc. are also missing. All these training details should be included in the appendix.\n\n8) Minor: Figure 1: \"Append an initial sentence...\",  section 3: \"map discrete text into a high dimensional...\",  section 3.2.2: \"Different from attacking sentiment analysis...\" ....\n\nIn summary, the research direction of adversarial text generation studied in this paper is interesting and promising. However, some technical details are questionable, and the produced results without rigorous metrics seem to be unconvincing. \n"}
