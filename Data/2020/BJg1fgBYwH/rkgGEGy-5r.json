In the hybrid network, learned feature is the concatenation of traditionally supervised-ly learned features and those from an auxiliary\u00a0module trained locally and unsupervised-ly by STDP. The new network demonstrates improved noise robustness via improved classification accuracy on Cifar10 and ImageNet subset when input data have noise, on different network architectures.\n\nThe paper, however, fails to address the many works in the literature about adversarial perturbations ('attack') and adversarial training ('defense'), starting by\u00a0(Szegedy et al., 2013). The different types of attacks\u00a0affect the efficiency\u00a0of defense due to the game-theoretical nature of the adversarial perturbation\u00a0problem. If the attack is blind to the classification model, e.g., Gaussian attack by adding Gaussian noise, then image restoration\u00a0techniques like denoising could provide an effective 'defense'. Thus model-specific attacks are of more application interest than model-blind ones. The current manuscript did not address the specific noise type being used to perturb the image. It is unlikely that the local learning techniques proposed in the paper can work on many kinds of perturbations especially the 'attacks' which is model specific.\u00a0\n\nThe proposed methodology is a feature concatenation of local (low-level) features of image data and deep features. Given the current state of the manuscript, the level of methodological novelty and the scope of input perturbations that can be made robust against both appear to be limited.\n\nReferences:\nChristian Szegedy, Wojciech Zaremba, Ilya Sutskever, Joan Bruna, Dumitru Erhan, Ian Goodfellow, and Rob Fergus.
