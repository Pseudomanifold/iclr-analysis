The paper is well-written and the experimental results seem sensible. The experimental results mainly revolve around testing the networks over noise added to training images.  The problem of image denoising is very well-studied and very good methods have been proposed for image denoising under arbitrary noise using deep learning (see the works in CVPR, ICCV, ECCV etc.). Unfortunately, I am not in the position to judge the novelty \nwrt spiking neuron network literature. Nevertheless, as far as computer vision or general applications is concerned the proposed pipeline would not be among the methods of choice.  Hence, I am recommending weak reject for now, waiting for a more informed opinion to see if I will change my opinion.  "}
