Using Discriminator to estimate the likelihood ratio is a commonly used approach, which was first proposed in [1]. This is also generalized as a reversed KL based GAN in [2] [3]. The authors failed to discuss this with these previous works in Section 3.3 and in Related works.\n\n2. How is the best of many comparing with importance sampling method? I think using importance sampling is the most intuitive baseline.\n\n3. this paper is not well written. L_1/L_2 has never explained throughout this paper, also has typos such as \"taiend\".\n\n\n[1] Adversarial Variational Bayes: Unifying Variational Autoencoders and Generative Adversarial Networks\n[2] Variational Annealing of GANs: A Langevin Perspective\n[3] Symmetric variational autoencoder and connections to adversarial learning"}
