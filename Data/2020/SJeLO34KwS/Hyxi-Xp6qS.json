I could only provide little recommendation. I have tried to read this paper, but it was rather tedious with heavy notations. It would be more friendly to represent the models in visible way for example using diagrams as I can see that the model is a sequence matrix operators with non-linear transformations after that. The paper states that the proposed DrGCNs can improve the stability of GCN models via mean field theory. The experiments were conducted  on benchmark datasets and the proposed method was compared to several GCN variations. "}
