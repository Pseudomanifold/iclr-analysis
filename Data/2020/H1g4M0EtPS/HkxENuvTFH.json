This embeds covariance structures of input data space into the gradient operator for an adversary attack.\nThey further use this gradient operator with a fast gradient sign Method. The numerics show effective for using fewer queries to obtain high attack accuracy. This paper is well written with clear derivations. I suggest the publication of the paper.\n\n In fact, modeling the structure of an input space structure into the adversary attack is a good direction. For similar intuitions in this direction, I recommend a related work:\n      \n         \"A. Lin, Y. Dukler, W. Li, G. Montufar, Wasserstein Diffusion Tikhonov Regularization\" \n "}
