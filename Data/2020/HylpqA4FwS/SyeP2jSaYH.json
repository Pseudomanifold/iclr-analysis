Theoretically, the equilibrium point of iRNN exists and is unique. Furthermore, the norm of the Jacobian between two hidden states is always one, provided that the Euler iterations converge. The authors proved this property as well as the exponential convergence rate of the Euler iteration. These properties avoid the vanishing/exploding gradient problem typical in RNN with long sequences in theory. Empirically, the proposed method is compared with multiple RNN architecture on various tasks. \n\nThe paper is clearly written and well organized. It starts with the existence and uniqueness of a fixed point; then provides the converge rate, and finally the main theorem of identity gradient. The main theorem provides a good theoretically guaranteed solution. The authors have done extensive experiments on several datasets compared against various popular and recently developed RNN-based models. The authors also provided some empirical experiments on the converge rate and the non-singularity of grad \\psi.\n\nThe motivation of the paper could be improved. For example, despite the appealing theoretical properties. I did not fully understand the motivation in Equation 3. It would be great if the authors could further elaborate on it.\n\nTypos:\nPage 4 at \u201cUpon computation, we see that\u201d.
