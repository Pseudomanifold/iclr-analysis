Although the paper is interesting in general, and the experiment results are strong, I still feel that the current version of the paper has not quite met the (very high) standard of ICLR, for the following reasons:\n\n1) The authors need to better motivate the advantages of using Shapley value as a data valuation metric. It is not completely clear to me why Shapley value is a good data valuation metric, compared with other options. The authors argue that it is both fair and decomposable (linear in U). However, based on Section 2.2, it is only fair under two extreme cases (identical points and zero marginal contributions). Also, it seems that a lot of other metrics will also satisfy the decomposability condition. Please explain!\n\n2) Section 3 and Section 4.1 focus on U defined in equation (3), in which the testing set is a singleton. It seems to be a major limitation of the paper and it is not clear to me whether or not it is easy to generalize the results in these two sections to the general testing set with multiple points. Please explain!\n\n3) In Definition 3, the definition for the dummy point. This definition requires that U(S \\union {z_i}) = U(S) for any S \\subseteq D, and in particular it should hold for S=\\emptyset. Does U({z_i}) = U(\\emptyset) make sense in most practical problems?\n\nA typo: in Definition 2, n and N should be the same.\n\n"}
