On Page 4, the authors explain the reasons why they use TGCNN instead of RNN-based architectures to capture the temporal representation. However, it would be more convincing if quantitative analysis or empirical results are provided.\n\n2. On Page 4, readers might be confused with the symbols in the formulation (3) that are not defined clearly.\n\n3. On Page 7, the experiment only considers one metric, i.e., RMSE. The efficiency comparisons between the proposed model and the baselines are missing."}
