Hence, I recommend for a reject.\n\n\nSupporting argument:\n1. Compared to https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11932, I found the use of evolutionary approach is ill-motivated. Different from the perturbations, which is bounded by some constraints, in images, the perturbations in natural language is distinguishable to human and do not have valid semantic or syntactic structures. \n2. I think the study of fooling attack is less interesting compared to other semantic, syntactic preserving attacks.\n3. In Figures 2, 3, 4, what\u2019s the reason that the maximum value exceeds 1?\n4. There is no quantitative measure in Section 6.7.\n5. Section 6.3, it is basically adversarial training.\n\n\nAdditional feedback:\n1. P1, Q2: fooling images -> fooling sentences\n2. P2, \u2018in other to\u2019-> \u2018in order to\u2019\n"}
