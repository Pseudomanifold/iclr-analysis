Instead of either cutting out a patch or adding gaussian noise, the authors propose to adding a patch of gaussian noise to the images. Although possibly useful practically, this proposal lacks theoretical base on how and why it would be better, besides the claim that hopefully the combination will combine the benefit and subtract the weakness. The experiments are rather limitted to support the claim."}
