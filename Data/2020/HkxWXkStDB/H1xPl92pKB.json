The method is shown to improve robustness without sacrificing accuracy on clean data.\nPros:\nThe proposed method, despite being simple, seems to empirically work well in terms of the mCE criterion evaluated in the experiments. This does support the authors\u2019 claim that current methods haven\u2019t reached the robustness/accuracy tradeoff boundary yet.\nCons:\nI\u2019m a bit concerned about the significance of the work though. The method is a straight-forward combination of existing methods, so methodologically the novelty is kind of limited. Hence, I\u2019m expecting more insights from the analysis of the results, to gain more understanding of why it works so well. However, the presentation of the experiments just seems to aim for the best numbers one can get (I\u2019m not certain how significant the numbers are to this field though). A few examples/pictures of success cases (when the method works) and failure cases (when the method doesn\u2019t work), may help readers (I\u2019m not an expert) to better understand the approach and get more intuitions? The frequency analysis seems quite intuitive. It\u2019s obvious that Gaussian filter blocks high-frequency components, and Cutout keeps some original parts of the image which allow high-freq details to be captured. But, considering CIFAR image size is only 32x32, a patch of size 25 is quite large, how much is the method different from plain whole image Gaussian then?\n"}
