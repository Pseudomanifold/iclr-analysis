It introduces a time gate in the LSTM to handle the temporal dependency and uses an attention mechanism to select relevant nodes to learn the underlying dynamics. \n\nOverall, this paper is not easy to understand in detail. Firstly, it is unclear how and why the temporal point process can deal with growing/shrinking graph nodes and changing interactions. Secondly, how does the DIP-UNIT handle the continuous graph changing? What if the graph changes with an uneven speed? Thirdly, how do all the small pieces work together to achieve the goal of the paper? An overview diagram or a toy example would greatly improve the readability of the paper. \n\nBesides, what is the computational cost of the proposed network? How large a graph could be and how fast its changes could be captured? "}
