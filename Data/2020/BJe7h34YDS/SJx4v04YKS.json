This view provides new insights into GAN training and may inspire future research along this direction. This paper is overall well written, with a smooth introduction of background material that might be less familiar for machine learning researchers. There are places that need further clarification, but I think the proposed direction is promising.\n\nQuestions about the method:\n\n- Since the proposed method starts from Laplace transform, it would be helpful to further discuss the connection between other methods that regularises the eigenvalues of the Jacobian (such as spectral-normalisation), which work in the frequency domain from a different perspective. For example, could the proposed regulariser be interpreted as imposing certain constraint on the spectrum of Jacobian?\n\n- Does section 2.2 depend on the assumption of linear dynamics?\n\n- Does the E in eq.7 come from eq. 4?\n\n- Could you give some intuition for the paragraph above section 3.4, about the different form of inputs when treating D and G as dynamics? For consistency, it is perhaps better to keep the dependency of p_D and p_G on x explicit (same for eq. 10), unless this is intended?\n\n- My main concern about the analysis is that it shows why several methods (e.g., momentum, multiple update steps) are *not* helpful for stabilising GANs, but does not tell why training with these methods, as well as others such as gradient penalty, *do converge* in practice with properly chosen hyper-parameters?\n\nExperiments:\n\n- About setup: the paper reports using ResNets for natural images as in Mescheder et al. (2018). However, Mescheder et al. (2018) uses DCGAN for CIFAR10, which raises further questions about the scores on this dataset:\n\n- The baseline scores of Reg-SGAN and Reg-WGAN seem to be worse than those reported in Mescheder et al. (2018), which have inception scores above 6 according to Figure 6 of their paper. In Figure 5 of this paper, they are clearly below 6. What\u2019s the reason for this discrepancy?\n"}
