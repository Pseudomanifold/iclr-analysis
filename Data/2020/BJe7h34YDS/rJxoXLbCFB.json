Their method, effectively, adds an L2 regularization to the output of the discriminator.\n\nI have some concerns regarding the novelty, analysis and also the experiments.\n\n- The analysis has focused on a very simple case of having a linear discriminator which for example in WGAN, forces the first moments to match. How does the analysis extend to more realistic cases?\n\n- In eq 9 in the dynamics of WGAN section, the discriminator should be restricted to Lip functions. This has not been considered in the analysis.\n\n- There are a few work in the literature that analyze local stability of GANs (e.g. https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04156) as well as using some control theory for analyzing global stability of GANs (e.g. https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10793). The connections of the proposed approach with existing literature should be better explained.\n\n- In the empirical results, the performance of the proposed method and Reg-GAN (from the numerics of GAN paper) are quite similar. Are there instances that the proposed approach significantly improves the stability of practical GAN architectures?\n\n"}
