The authors proposed an end-to-end 3D CNN structure that combines color features as well as 3D features for the prediction, and experimental results on SUNCG and ScanNet demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.\n\nThe writing of the paper is clear and I appreciate authors for providing clear diagrams for the network structure to better help understand the network structure. The formulation of the network structure (which is similar to [Hou et al., CVPR 2019] makes sense and experimental results clearly demonstrate that the proposed approach is reasonable.\n\nI have a few questions regarding the paper:\n- Do authors have intuitions on using more 3D features beyond simply using TSDF to represent 3D features? From the network structure, it seems that 3D features may have fewer dimensions (channels) than 2D color features. \n- The performance exceeds previous approaches, such as [Hou et al., 2019], however, the performance is still quite low (20-30 mAP). It'll be good if authors can provide more details on failure cases and make more detailed discussions on why there is still a long way to go. The trend of using more features is helpful is also not consistent in Table 3, it'll be good if authors can provide more contexts. \n- Since this is a new task. I wonder if authors can provide a concrete application that this paper can be used. I understand there are many scientific questions and interests behind this project, but a concrete application may be more useful as motivations. For example, why a certain application can use 3D-SIS instead of [Song et al., 2017], or other RGB-D completion algorithms (tasks)? "}
