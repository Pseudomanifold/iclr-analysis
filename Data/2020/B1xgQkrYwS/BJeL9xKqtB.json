In particular, the authors tested several different pruning techniques by varying evaluation criteria (L_1, L_2, L_-\\infty and random) and pruning structures (structured, unstructured and hybrid). The authors perform experiments mainly on LeNet with the MNIST dataset and analyze the observations.\n\nOverall, I think that the observations presented in the paper are not significant due to the following reasons.\n\nFirst, the paper consists of the list of observations but how the observations extend to is not clearly described. There are no guidelines how to utilize the observations in future research (e.g., how they can be used for verifying the lottery ticket hypothesis or how they affect to existing pruning techniques) while some observations might be trivial or not very interesting (e.g., contribution 1 and contribution 2) for me.\n\nSecond, the observations are only presented for LeNet and MNIST and it is non-trivial whether they extend to large scale models. The authors present VGG11 and AlexNet results in Appendix but they are not large enough to verify their hypothesis for practice. The authors mentioned that larger models are not their subject, but this significantly reduces the confidence of the observations.\n\nOther comments:\nI think that Figure 5 is not well described. Explicitly noting the meaning of color in the figure would be better.\n\nTexts in Figure 7 are too small to read.\n"}
