They extend the work of Savarese et al. on the univariable function by introducing the Randon Transform and R-norm to this problem.  The authors finally prove that any function in Sobolev space could be (approximately) obtained by a bounded network. The results achieved implies some generalization performance analysis and the induction error. Also, according to the authors, the difference between R-norm and RKHS norm might lead to the distinct from neural networks and kernel methods.\n\nI would recommend accepting this paper since it might give a good insight into understanding the performance of the network beyond the traditional method."}
