My reasonings are as follows.\n\n1) The caption of Figure 1 does that match the figure and the text, which causes confusion right from the start.\n2) The definition of filter score in 2.1.3 is extremely confusing: what is the difference between filter scores and \"each kernel's important score\"? Also, what does it mean that \"K is a group of indices belong to the 37th kernel? Should there be only one 37th kernel? If I understand it correctly, the input image (of size 1x28x28) is first convolved with, say, 40 pre-defined filters, which produces a first-layer feature map of dimension 40x28x28. Than is the 37th filter score a scalar or a number? Is it the sum (over every pixel) of the salient map of the 37-th output-channel of the first-layer feature map?\n3) The authors claimed that replacing the first-layer of a DNN with enough pre-determined filters does not decrease the accuracy of the network. This is not a surprise, and also, in my opinion, does not contribute significantly to this field.\n\nBased on the above reason, I do not recommend accepting the paper for publication."}
