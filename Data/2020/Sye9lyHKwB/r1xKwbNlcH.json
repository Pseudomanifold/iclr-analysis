The three proposals in this paper are intuitive and practical: perturb the inputs (infer-transformation in the paper), perturb middle layers using gaussian noise (infer-noise in the paper) and perturb middle layers using dropout (infer-dropout in the paper). The authors show results on regression problems such as single image super resolution and monocular depth estimation.\n\nThis paper tackles an interesting problem but I believe it barely warrants acceptance as a conference paper. My concerns are\n- The paper introduces algorithms which output an additional number which they call uncertainty. What it is lacking though is a theoretical foundation/model of what type of uncertainty is captured? In my opinion this paper relies heavily on the correlation of this additional \"uncertainty\" with the error metric in the experiments. For this reason, I classify the paper as sharing an interesting observation but not strong on bringing in new insights.\n- The writing quality of the paper could be better. I find that Section 1, 3, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 repeat the basic idea of the paper three times. Similarly section 1 and 2 repeat a lot of info on related work. I think this can be done more succinctly.\n- In the foundation sections (e.g. 3.1) the authors assume E[T' o F o T(x)] = F(x). It is unclear why in a non-linear world this assumption is justified? I actually feel that because the authors don't use rotation in their experiment section on monocular depth estimation, they actually themselves don't believe this assumption is true.\n- In section 4.3 the authors introduce the error metric. Although I am not familiar with the previous work they cite, I find the evaluation of the uncertainties insufficient: e.g. a minimal requirement for uncertainties are that they are calibrated."}
