Though widely applied on the task of segmentation, the use of only uncalibrated input and extremely sparse label for depth estimation is novel. By incorporating optical flow and decoupling global and local modules, this pipeline aligns well with disparity-based geometric methods. The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow. \n\n\nHere are some concerns:\n\nSome important details are missing in order to reproduce the results. For example, the forward pipelines of the global module and the local module are covered with only few sentences. The authors should expand the section of methodology and give better formulations of their pipeline.\n\nHow much does the quality of input optical flow affect the results? Also, the author claimed \u2018the network has the opportunity to correct for small inaccuracies or outliners in the optical flow input\u2019, could you show any result related to this claim? (e.g. flawed optical flow but good output)\n\nCan you try to incorporate the optical flow module and fine-tune for better results? \n\nAre there some failure cases, and some visualizations on the filter banks of the local network?"}
