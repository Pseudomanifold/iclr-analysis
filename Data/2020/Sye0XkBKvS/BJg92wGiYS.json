Novel, timely, and of broad interest.\n\nPAPER SUMMARY\nThe paper presents a new method for estimating parameters in a neural ODE based on a polynomial representation of trajectories and alternating updates of trajectories and neural net parameters.\n\nCLARITY\nThe presentation is exceptionally clear.\n\nORIGINALITY\nTo my knowledge the proposed method is novel.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE\nThe paper demonstrates a strong and practically significant improvement in learning, and I expect the results will be of interest to everybody working in this area.\n\nFURTHER COMMENTS\n\nIn eq. 2, \"X\" (blackboard typeface) is not defined. At this point, it is not clear how x(t) is represented.\n\n\"trades-off\" -> trades off\n\n"}
