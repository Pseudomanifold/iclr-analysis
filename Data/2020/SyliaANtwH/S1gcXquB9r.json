The generation model is based on MAML and the experiments partially show the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\nThe problem is interesting and using MAML to generate adversarial poisoning examples is timely. However, my concerns are:\n\n1. The paper is not well-organized. For example, (1) the first section should be named as \"Introduction\"; (2) In figure 6, the location of three figures is not in a line.\n2. The technical contribution is limited. The authors simply apply MAML to generate adversarial poisoning examples. The motivation is clear but the design is quite straightforward. No new attack/defense models are proposed. I think the contribution is lower than the acceptance bar of ICLR.\n3. No baselines are compared. The authors should compare the proposed model with other adversarial sample generation methods in the experiments."}
