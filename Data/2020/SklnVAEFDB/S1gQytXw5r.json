BERTAL aims to overcome the limit of maximal allowable text length in BERT, and the experiments show some consistent performance enhancement to baseline architecture using BERT and approaching performance to state-of-the-art architecture using BERT (BERTSUM), where BERTSUM has the maximal length limit .\n           The experimental procedures as well as the choice of architectural design are well explained and designed in a logical way. Substantial comparison experiments also pinpoint the performance.\n            However, it doesn\u2019t compare the result of BERTAL to other text summarizers with arbitrary-length text, which is not based on BERT."}
