The authors bridge the gap between novelty detection and few-shot classification models. The paper addresses an interesting task in machine learning but in point of view of the out-of-distribution detection task, the proposed method seems to be an incremental task and far from the state-of-the-art.\n\n--The authors claim that the combination of one-class classification and few-shot classification has not been studied before, while this task is implicitly mentioned in previous work. For instance, these topics are explored in \u201cOut-of-Distribution Detection for Generalized Zero-Shot Action Recognition\u201d for a specific task.\n--The authors divided the out-of-dataset (OOS) into three categories, while the most famous state-of-the-art methods for one class classification task especially those that are devised based on reconstruction error or adversarial training schemes do not fall in any of these categorized.\n--Detecting the OOS samples task is very similar to recognizing the membership attack task, but the authors do not mention anything about them.\n--The proposed model has access to the negative samples (OOD samples) during training. First, this assumption is not realistic, as in all such applications, the irregular (OOD) samples are either poorly sampled or not sampled at all. Second, most of the previous works on OOD assume that OOD samples are not available during training. This makes them not directly comparable to the proposed methods that its settings are more-or-less advantaged. \n--Page 4 \u2013 what is D_c\u2019 or C\u2019 in Eqs. (3) and (4)?\n\n"}
