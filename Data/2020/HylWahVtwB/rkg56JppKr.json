Overall, it lacks of innovation and experimental results are not strong enough. \n\n\t1. The innovation and technical contribution are weak. The key idea of searching in embedding space has already been proposed and applied in  Luo et al. 2018. The authors do not differentiate this work from Luo et al. 2018, and I didn't find any essential differences between them.\n\n\t2. The proposed method does work well. It is not compared with latest algorithms including NAO and DARTS. The reported numbers in Table 2 are poor, far from SOTA numbers.\n\nBesides, there are many writing issues and typos."}
