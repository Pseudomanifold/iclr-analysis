The paper builds on the architecture as in GCN and in addition to the dual pipelines, one from the graph and other it's dual, employs KL divergence to achieve the final prediction.\n\nThe paper leaves inadequate explanation on the results, where the proposed TwinGCN comes short in 2 of 3 methods compared to other methods in Table 1, which cannot be ignored considering the slow convergence and marginal improvements, compared to GCN with double pipeline in Table 3. This leaves the premise of the authors on adding improvements to the learning ability by bringing in features from dual graph on shaky grounds."}
