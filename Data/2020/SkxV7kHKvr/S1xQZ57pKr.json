The model is composed of two GCNs, one on the primal graph and one on the dual graph. The paper is well written and easy to follow. However, the novelty and contribution are rather limited, and the performance improvement of the proposed method is rather limited. Following are the detailed comments:\n\n1. The novelty and contribution of the paper are rather limited. The idea of dual graph has been exploited by [1]. The proposed method is simple combination of prime and dual without convincing explanation on why primal dual graph can improve the performance. The authors may need to give more explanations on why such combination can improve the performance.\n\n2. The performance improvement of the proposed method is marginal. In fact, the proposed method doesn\u2019t outperform DGCN\n\n3. Experiments need to be improved. The authors didn\u2019t compare with GNNs that also adopts primal and dual graphs. The authors should consider comparing the proposed method with DPGCN in [1].\n\n[1] Monti, Federico, et al. \"Dual-primal graph convolutional networks.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1806.00770 (2018).\n"}
