The improvement upon the standard CD and persistent CD is clear.\nIt also appears that the algorithm actually does not require too many steps and generally does not introduce a lot of computational overhead. \nThe only question I have is why CD has only been tried with k=1 steps? \nI would be interested in its performance for different number of steps including the dynamically chosen number provided by the empirical \\tau in UCD for a given iteration.\nEven though I do not expect a significant improvement to be obtained, this would separate the effect of the number of steps chosen \u201cright\u201d from unbiasedness of the gradient estimator.\nOther baselines, including those mentioned in the related work, could also make the comparison more complete.\n\nI would also suggest including https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04062, as it seems to be relevant in the spirit."}
