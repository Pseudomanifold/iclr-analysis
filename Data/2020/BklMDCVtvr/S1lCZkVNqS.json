It also provides an interpretable symbolic structure and examines the causal information in the symbolic structure.\n\nThe approach is inspired by the Tensor Product Encoder architecture.\n\nThe scan role analysis part seemed the most hand-wavy with lots of positions in A.7.\n\nNone of the accuracy results have variances attached to them.\n\nI am not an expert on this topic (hence the weak accept), but I liked the paper.\n\n"}
