A new type of NN, called ROLE, is proposed to learns to approximate the representations of a target NN E by learning a symbolic constituent structure and an embedding of that structure intoE\u2019s representational vector space. A number of tasks are conducted, including a simple fully-compositional task, a SCAN task, a partially-compositional NLP task. Multiple tasks. The experiment results show that the proposed approach can help to understand how NNs achieve strong generalization on partially-compositional tasks, and good performance on fully-compositional task.\u00a0\nPros:\n1. This work studies an important problem of\u00a0fundamental AI.\n2. Authors conduct experiments on multiple task to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed technique and show how it helps to understand the generalization of NNs.\n3.\u00a0The overall paper is well written, except for some typos, e.g. in page 5, Table 1 Should \"1.0\" be \"100%\"? Should \"0.828 be ''82.80\".\u00a0\u00a0\nCons:\n1. Regarding the Q2 raised in the paper, only simple suggestions are given. It is suggested to evaluate its effectiveness on some real experiments."}
