The paper is overall well written and conveys an interesting new formulation of GANs. However, the reviewer is concerned with the following questions:\nThe paper is mainly on analyzing the case when the true data has n points instead of on a continuous support. It would be more interesting to see theoretical guarantee on even Gaussian mixture model. Also since GANs are mostly known for generalizing what is seen to generate new data, whether converging only to the n points are good or not still worth debating.\nIn claim 4.2 and 4.3, what if the initialization of y is completely random? Then the claim cannot say anything on mode collapse. So is the formulation in the paper the real characterization of mode collapse?\n"}
