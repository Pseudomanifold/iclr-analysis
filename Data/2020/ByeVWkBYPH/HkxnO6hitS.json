The loss is motivated from the idea of computing the eigenvectors sequentially. However doing so would be computationally expensive, and the authors show that the loss function they propose (sum of sequential losses) has the same order (constant less than 7) of computational complexity as using the squared loss. A proof of the correctness of the algorithm is given, along with experiments to verify its performance.\n\nThe loss function proposed in the paper is useful, and the decomposition in Lemma 1 shows that it is not computationally expensive. While the writing of the proofs of the theorems is clear, I find it hard to understand the flow of the paper. It would help if the authors could summarize the argument of the proof at the start of Sec 4. Along a similar vein, it would also help if the authors could describe in words the significance / claim of every theorem.\n\nThe repetition in stating the theorems can be avoided. The main result (Theorem 2) is stated twice."}
