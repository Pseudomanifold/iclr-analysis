In order to see what parts are important to the point cloud classification, this approach smooth parts of the point cloud to remove certain shape features and evaluate the result on the original network. In addition, the author proves that the distance from the point to its local plane can represent the local curvature, which inspires them to find a proper way to smooth the shape.\n\nI think the overall work is novel and interesting. But this paper also has some imprecise parts, here are a few:\n1)\tWhat is the motivation of using the constant mean curvature to smooth the point clouds?\n2)\tWhat is the value of \u03b2 on the equation 11 in the experiments?\n3)\tThere are some typing errors, e.g. \u201cthe a\u201d in the 35th line. And the format of reference is nonstandard in line 405 to 406.\n\n\n"}
