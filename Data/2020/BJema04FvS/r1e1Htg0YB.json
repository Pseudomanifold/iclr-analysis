For example, in Figure 1(a). My confusion is why this is a real machine learning problem, despite the fact that papers are apparently being written about it at good conferences. For example, the quantitative measures being used are \u201cinternal\u201d to the problem and seem to presuppose that this is useful, but it\u2019s not clear if this helps do classification better or generate fake data better, or what? In general the paper is written well and the presentation is clear, but the problem doesn\u2019t seem important to me.\n\nAnother concern is that the method seems only tangentially related to deep learning. The algorithm itself appears to be unrelated to deep learning, but can be run on the output of a deep learning model. Much of the idea is at the technical level of kernel smoothing (e.g., Eq 14), which is useful but very simple and not clearly an ICLR-type deep learning technical advance.\n\nThe paper is also proposed as an extension of a 2D visualization technique called I-GOS in Qi et al, (2019) to 3D in Section 3.2. Gradients apparently are more complicated in this higher dimensionality, which is addressed by Eq 14."}
