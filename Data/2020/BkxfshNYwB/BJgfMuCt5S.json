It is an interesting idea and performs well in a number of tasks. However, due to the limitation of novelty and poor organizations, this paper cannot meet the standard of ICLR. The detailed reasons why I give a weak reject are listed as follows:\n\n1. Even though the proposed minCUT pool is interesting, the contribution is not enough to get published in the ICLR. If I understand correctly, the only difference is the unsupervised loss, compared with the previous work, Diffpool [1].\n \n2. The paper needs to be reorganized to demonstrate its contribution. The proposed method section only has around 1.5 pages, making it difficult to understand the proposed method clearly. Therefore, more details and analyses about the proposed method should be included to support and clarify the idea.\n \n3. The paper needs to be improved for its theoretical derivations and proof. For example, it is not clear why Equation (6) is correct, which is the main contribution of this paper. The authors provide intuitive thoughts but there are not theoretical derivations and proof. The term $L_c$ comes from Equation (2) but why is it correct to only compute the trace?\n \n4. Some experiments cannot support the claim very well.  For example, the graph clustering experiments are not convincing. The goal of graph pooling is to learn high-level graph embeddings but not perform graph clustering. It is not proper to evaluate the graph pooling method using graph clustering tasks. Or, the author should clarify the motivation to do this experiment. If the model is trained for graph classification or node classification, then why should the node clusters lead to high NMI or CS scores?\n\n[1].
