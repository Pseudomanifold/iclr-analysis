The model is potentially pre-trained on a large scale dataset from another domain. The suggested method is applying spatial attention according to entropy criteria (or certainty) of the original classifier (from a different domain).\n\n\nI think the suggested task is important and more realistic than the usual FSL benchmarks. I would modify it so instead of discarding mini-imagenet classes that are overlapping with Places I would discard the problematic Places classes. This way it will be easier to compare to standard FSL. Also, I don\u2019t understand why for CUB the benchmarks includes k={0,1,5} while for mini-imagenet it is k={0,20,50}, obviously k={0,1,5} are more interesting.\n\nAs for the suggested method, I find it hard to judge since there are no strong baselines to compare against. Also, the ablation study of removing the attention and/or adaptation doesn\u2019t result in a definitive conclusion. "}
