It extends on the previous work by adding a diagonal correction term to the Kronecker-factored eigenbasis and also suggests a low-rank representation of Kronecker-factored eigendecomposition. Empirical evaluations were done to show that the proposed method has a more accurate uncertainty estimation compared to the previous work.\n\nOverall, the paper is well-organized and easy to follow, although mathematical notations are not consistent throughout the paper. It is well-referenced, and the derivations look mostly correct (explained in minor comments). The main idea of the paper is convincing and well-motivated. To my knowledge, the proposed method of adding a correction term has not been introduced before. However, it is more of an incremental contribution to the existing works. In that sense, I am slightly concerned that its novelty is limited.\n\nThe experiments are not comprehensive. For the toy regression problem, a comparison to Hamiltonian Monte Carlo would be more informative. Moreover, it would be helpful to report the comparison with factorized variational methods (e.g. Graves, 2011) and experiment on modern architectures. I would be also interested to see what the additional time complexity by adding a diagonal correction term is and how more efficient it gets by low-rank approximation in experimental details.\n \nMinor comments:\n*Page 4: It would have been easier to understand if there had been a notational distinction between exact eigenbasis and K-FAC eigenbasis in defining V. Also, \u201cIn equation equation 10\u201d -> \u201cIn equation 10\u201d.\n*Page 7: In Lemma 2, the order in describing the low-rank estimate does not appear to be correct. Also, in Lemma 4, shouldn\u2019t there be a hat on I_{efb} and I_{kfac}?\n*Page 9: The colour scheme in Figure 3 looks visually harder to read.\n*Page 14: In equation 15 and 16, there should be a bracket for (2 \\pi), and in Appendix B, some variables (e.g. p, k, R) are left unexplained.\n*Page 14, 15: In equation 23 and proposition 1, \\mathcal is missing, and vec operator is missing in equation 22.\n*Page 3: In equation 2 and 4, is it A_{i-1} or A_i?\n*Page 16: In equation 27, the dimension of X \\in \\mathcal{R}^{m \\times m} seems incorrect. Also, in the last line, doesn\u2019t X \\odot D have different dimensions (similarly in equation 22)? "}
