The Laplace-based approximation is half-baked and certainly much better techniques for Bayes exist in the recent literature; furthermore, it's selection is not substantiated enough, and, of course, it represents no novelty. The experimental results are not convincing, as both the considered scenarios are limited and the comparisons are too poor (no consideration of state of the art alternatives). The provided corollaries are not actually helpful and should be put in the appendix. "}
