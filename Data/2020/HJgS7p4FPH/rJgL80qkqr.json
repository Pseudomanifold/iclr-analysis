It was the bottleneck analysis that changed my mind.  It was done very thoroughly and it provides deep insight in the challenges that RL faces for both learning and inference in a variety of settings.  I especially liked the analysis of the advantages and limitations of GPU emulation.  I also thought the Discussion section was well written.\n\nThe paper would be better if:\n1) The figure fonts were larger throughout the paper.\n2) The gaps in Table 1 were explained.\n\nMinor issue:  Change \"feed\" to \"fed\" on page 3.\n"}
