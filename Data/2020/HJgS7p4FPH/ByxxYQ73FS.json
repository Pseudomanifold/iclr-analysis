The paper goes into detail examining the benefits that come from a GPU-only implementation, including much better per-GPU utilization as well as no need to run a distributed system of CPUs. They show this hardware scaling can be taken advantage of across a variety of state of the art reinforcement learning algorithms and indeed create new batching strategies to utilize their framework and the GPU better. \n\nThe paper is well written and goes into some detail describing the implementation of CuLE as well as various design decisions taken, as with splitting the emulation process across several kernels. Finally, the paper is very explicit about a number of optimizations that are not being exploited by the new framework and serve as markers for future work.\n\nA question that arises and which is not addressed in the experiments is how the authors verified their port is faithful to the original version; there is no mention of correctness in the paper."}
