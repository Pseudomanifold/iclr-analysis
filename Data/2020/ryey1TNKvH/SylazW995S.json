The dual path takes a dual graph as inputs, where the dual graph does not contain the original edges but has edges connecting nodes with similar topology. They determine the edges in the dual graph by using several algorithms proposed by previous studies.\n\nCons:\n1. The idea is very incremental. First, using a dual path to augment GNNs is not novel. A similar idea can be found in \"Supervised Community Detection with Line Graph Neural Networks\" (ICLR 2019). Second, the methods to determine \"non-local\" edges in the dual graph all come from old graph algorithms (all before 2010 except for one in 2014). Third, the edges in the dual graph are determined in a pre-processing step and not learned during training.\n2. The writing is poor and does not provide a fruitful \"method\" section. Two pages of \"introduction\" are not desired for a 8-page paper. The paper is more like an experimental report or technical blog.\n3. The experimental results are not convincing. Several strong baselines from ICML 2019 and KDD 2019 are not included. In addition, as the results are \"average accuracy over 100 trials\", why the std. is missing in Table 1?"}
