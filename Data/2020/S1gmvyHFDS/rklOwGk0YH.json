The high level idea is to learn a watermark/detector pair (W,D). W can be any transformation (in this paper, an l-infty bounded perturbation) that imputes an imperceptible distortion to a given input, while D is a detector that distinguishes watermarked from non-watermarked images. There is an additional requirement that the detector should be robust to simple transformations such as rotations, cropping, flipping, and contrast enhancement. \n\nThe authors pose a min-max style learning problem for learning (W,D) that leads to a natural adversarial training scheme. In particular, it can be viewed as creating an adversarial defense to the Expectations-over-transformations attack of Athalye et al. Experimental results on a bunch of different datasets confirm that the method works,\n\nThe paper is well-written and the contributions are clear. In terms of conceptual or theoretical novelty, the paper is limited (the method essentially boils down to regular adversarial training with a slightly non-standard loss function) but the connection to watermarking seems novel and is nicely executed.\n\nMy only concern is the lack of comparisons with baselines. I am not a digital forensics expert -- so I don't know what the state of the art is -- but the only comparisons made are with the Broken Arrows (BA) watermarking , which seems to be over 10 years old, so I am not sure how to evaluate the results."}
