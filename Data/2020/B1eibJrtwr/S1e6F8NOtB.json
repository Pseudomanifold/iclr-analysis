The dataset for summarization was synthesized from an existing conversation dataset. \n\nThe new architecture is a minor variation of an existing pointer generator network presented by See et al. First the authors used two different sets of parameters to encode the user and the system responses. The authors also pre-process the dialog by replacing the slot values by their slot keys. Finally, the authors use an auxiliary task of detecting the domain of the dialog. \n\nThese three different enhancements are all called \"scaffolds\" by the authors, hance the title of the paper.\n\nThis paper is not suited for ICLR because of its limited novelty. The three enhancements proposed by the authors are long known and incremental. "}
