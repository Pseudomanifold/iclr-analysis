They train a GAN in a conditional way to\ngenerate a photo-realistic version of a given scene.\n\nIn my opinion, the novelty of the proposed approach is not high and the improvements are incremental. I have some concerns about the method as well: what happens if the quality of edge maps is not good for some datasets? Is it realistic to assume that the edge maps of real images are provided with high quality? \n\nRegarding the video generation, authors should compare their approach with recent video GAN papers such as https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.06571\n\nThere are several typos in the paper as well. I suggest that authors proof read their paper more carefully. "}
