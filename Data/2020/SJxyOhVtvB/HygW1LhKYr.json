Specifically, combining the idea of learning to reweight (Ren et al. 2018), pseudo labeling (Berthelot et al. 2019), MixUp regularization (Zhang et al. 2018 ICLR), etc. Excellent empirical results have been achieved. Sufficient details have been given to repeat the experiments. Overall, the paper is well-organized and presented. \n\nI appreciate that the performances have been greatly boosted for many datasets for dealing with label noise. \n\nHowever, as for an academic paper, I think only good empirical performance maybe not enough given that it is achieved by combining several existing methods.
