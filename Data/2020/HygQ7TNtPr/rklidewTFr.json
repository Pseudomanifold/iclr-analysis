The authors first formulate efficient training rules (ETR I and ETR II) and propose a normalization scheme for weight quantization based on the rules. Independently, the authors also propose an activation quantization rule by removing the approximated term in PACT. The authors present the effectiveness of their algorithm in MobileNet V1, V2, and PreResNet-50.\n\nOverall, I think the proposed algorithms lack novelty due to the following reasons.\n\n- SAT suggests a normalization scheme under some assumptions (ETR I and ETR 2), however, I am not sure this is a significant contribution compared to DoReFa. In particular, I have some doubt in assumptions which is listed in \u2018Other comments\u2019. \n\n- CG-PACT seems to be a simple variant of PACT. In methodological contribution, I believe that it could only be a marginal improvement with respect to PACT. In terms of empirical contribution, it was hard to see the improvement made by CG-PACT as PACT and PACT+CG exhibit similar performance in Table 4.\n\nOther comments\n- In the derivation of ETR 1, some approximations are not clear for me. For example, the authors drop \\gamma in (17). In addition, approximation in (16d) depends on the activation function and BN parameters but they are also ignored. I believe that incorporating all these would not introduce much computational overhead.\n\n- In (3) and (4), I think that equality only holds under some assumptions (e.g., an infinite number of parameters, i.i.d. weights, etc.) but they are not clearly mentioned. \n"}
