The authors explain previously observed bad behavior for hard-negative triplet mining showing that it tends to make all points close to each other. The authors propose a simple modification to the desired gradients and derive a loss function that gives those gradients. With this modification, they show that easy positive hard negative (EPHN) gives results that exceed or are competitive with state of the art approaches. The paper is well-written and makes a convincing argument which will be of interest to a broad community."}
