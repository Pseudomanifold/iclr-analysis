Specifically, they extend a generalization bound using matrix 1-norm and the Fisher-Rao norm, proving the effectiveness of adding noise to input data for generalizability. These bounds have no dependence on the size of networks being investigated. The authors also propose a technique for representing RNNs as a decomposition into a sum of linear networks with a difference term, which allows for easier estimation of Rademacher complexity. The authors claim this is a representation that can be extended to other neural network architectures such as convolutional networks. \n\nThis work has the potential to be of interest for the learning theory community on theoretical properties of recurrent neural networks.\n\nOne question I have for the authors: in the experiments on the IMDB dataset, the authors claim that the generalization error is worst at \\sigma_{\\epsilon} = 0, but it appears that the error is actually larger for \\sigma_{\\epsilon} = 0.4?
