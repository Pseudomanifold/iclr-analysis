The presentation of this paper is very poor.  The novelty is very limited.  The justification of the proposed architecture is not persuasive.  The experiment design has many flaws.  All the compared baselines are extremely weak.  The authors need to follow the experiment setup in more recent text classification papers.  Authors need at least to compare their methods to BERT.  The current version of this paper is definitely not an ICLR publication.  "}
