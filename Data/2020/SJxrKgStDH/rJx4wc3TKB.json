The method continues the \"Attend, Infer, Repear\" (AIR) and Sequential AIR (SQAIR) line of work, but improves on these previous approaches in terms of scalability and can thus be applied to scenes with tens of objects. The scalability is obtained by replacing, wherever possible, sequential processing of objects by parallel processing. Experiments are performed on three datasets: moving DSprites, moving MNIST, and the real-world \"Crowded Grand Central Station\" dataset. The method seems to work in all cases, as confirmed by quantitative evaluation on the first two datasets and a qualitative evaluation on all three.\n\nI recommend rejecting the paper in its current state. On one hand, the results look quite good, and the method seems to indeed scale well to many objects. On the other hand, novelty is limited and the experiments are limited in that there are no comparisons with relevant baselines and no clear experiments showing the specific impact of the architectural modifications proposed in this paper. Moreover, the paper is over 9 pages, which, as far as I remember, requires the reviewers apply \"higher standards\". Overall, I would like the authors to comment on my concerns (below) and may reconsider my rating after that.\n\nPros:\n1) Relatively clear presentation.\n2) Judging from the extensive qualitative results and the (limited) quantitative evaluation, the method seems to work.\n3) I appreciate the additoinal results on generalization and parallel disovery in the appendix.\n\nCons:\n1) Novelty of the work seems quite limited. The main contribution is in improving the efficiency of object detection/tracking by parallelizing the computation, without much conceptual innovation. This might be a sufficient contribution (in the end, efficiency is very important for actually applying methods in practice), but then a thorough evaluation of the method would be expected (see further comments about it further). Moreover, the previously published SPAIR method by Crawford and Pineau seems very relevant and related, but is not compared against and is only briefly commented upon, despite the code for that method seems to be available online. I would like the authors to clarify the relation to SPAIR and preferably provide an experimental comparison.\n\n2) The experiments are restricted. While there are quite many qualitative results, several issues remain:\n2a) No baseline results are reported. It is thus impossible to judge if the method indeed improves upon related prior works. In particular, comparisons to SQAIR and SPAIR would be very useful. If possible, it would be useful to provide even more baselines, for instance some traditional tracking methods. Comparisons can be both in terms of tracking/reconstruction performanc, as well as in terms of computational efficiency. Both can be measured as functions of the number of objects in the scene.\n2b) There are few quantitative resutls. In experiments 2-4 of section 5.1 it seems it would be fairly easy to introduce some, in particular, one could compare how do these more difficult settings compare to the \"default\" one. In section 5.2 given that the ground truth tracks are not available, evaluating tracking is challenging, but one could still compare NLL/reconstruction with appropriate baselines. The provided comparison to a vanilla VAE in therms of NLL is actually somewhat confusing - not sure what it tells the reader; moreover, I would actually expect the NLL of the proposed structured model to be better. Why is it not?\n2c) Since the paper is largely about tracking objects through videos, it would be very usefuly to include a supplementary video with qualitative results. \n\n3) (minor) Some issues with the presentation:\n3a) I found the method description at times confusing and incomplete. For instance, it is quite unclear which exactly architectures are used for different components. The details can perhaps bee looked up in the SQAIR paper, but it would still be useful to summarize most crucial points in the supplementary material to make the paper more self-contained.\n3b) The use of \\citet vs \\citep is often incorrect. \\citet should be used when the author names are a part of the text, while \\ciptp if the paper is cited in passing, for instance: \"Smith et al. (2010) have shown that snow is white.\" vs \"It is known that snow is white (Smith et al. 2010).\" \n3c) Calling AIR a \"seminal work in the field of object detection\" is not quite correct - object detection is a well-established task in computer vision, and AIR is not really considered a seminal work in that field. It is a great paper, but not really in object detection."}
