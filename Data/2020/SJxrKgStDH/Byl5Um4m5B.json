The paper proposes several improvements based on the method SQAIR (Kosiorek et al. 2018b), (1) modeling the background and foreground dynamics separately; (2) parallelizing the propagation-discovery process by introducing the propose-reject model which reducing the time complexity. Finally, the proposed model can deal with orders of magnitude more objects than previous methods, and can model more complex scenes with complex background.\n\nAccept.\nThe paper is clearly written and the experimental results are well organized. The results in the paper may be useful for unsupervised multi-objects tracking .I have one concern here, \n\uff081\uff09As argued in the paper, previous methods are difficult to deal with the nearly a hundred objects situation and there is no direct comparison for these methods. So has the author compared the method SCALOR with previous methods in few objects setting? Does the technical improvements of the method benefit in the few objects setting?"}
