It is not clear whether the model is *actually* optimizing an ELBO because the gradients from sequence reconstruction loss are not backpropogated to the inference network as explained in paragraph on Approximating Gradients of ELBO. Moreover this restriction makes the authors method almost the same as the one used for unsupervised neural machine translation by Lample et al 2017 and Artetxe et al 2017. I would like to see a more detailed analysis from authors on how far the performance of Gumbel-softmax estimator and REINFORCE estimator is from simple stop-gradient estimator used in experiments.\n\nIn terms of experimental setup I like that the authors considered a large suite of experiments across various tasks. Although the evaluation metrics on text style transfer tasks like sentiment transfer, formality transfer, author imitation are in line with previous work ideally the human evaluation needs to be done to truly see how well each method performs. On unsupervised machine translation, authors show a large improvement on Serbian-Bostian translation. I am a bit skeptical since as I wrote above the proposed method is very similar to previously proposed unsupervised neural machine translation approaches and it is not clear why we are seeking such a large gain of 5 BLEU points.\n\nOverall I think it is a well written paper with a large experimental suite, although I am skeptical of actual connection between probabilistic formulation and whats actually happening in practice."}
