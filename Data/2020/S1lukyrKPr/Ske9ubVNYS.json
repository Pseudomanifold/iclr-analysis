The model can further highlight the words that are responsible for the rumor accusation. \n\nProposed model consists of 4 sub models: a G_Where model finds the word to replace so to create an artificial rumor; a G_replace model decides what the replacement word should be; a D_classify model detects if a sequence is a rumor; a final D_explain model pinpoints the word of concern. D_ models and G_ models are trained in an adversarial competing way.\n\nExperiments showed that the LEX-GAN model outperforms other non-GAN models by a large margin on a previously published rumor dataset (PHEME) and in a gene classification task.\n\nMy questions:\n\n1) The task modeled is essentially a word replacement detection problem. Is this equivalent to rumor detection? Even if it performs really well on a static dataset, it could be very vulnerable to attackers. Various previous works mentioned in the paper, including the PHEME paper by Kochkina et al, used supporting evidence for detection, which sounds like a more robust approach.\n\n2) Authors didn't explain the rationale behind the choice of model structure, e.g. GRU vs LSTM vs Conv. The different structures have been used in mix in the paper. Are those choices irrelevant or critical?\n\n3) I would like to see more discussion on the nature of errors from those models, but it's lacking in the paper. This could be critical to understand the model\u2019s ability and limitation, esp given that it\u2019s not looking at supporting evidences from other sequences.\n\nSmall errors noticed: The citation for PHEME paper (Kochkina et al) points to a preprint version, while an ACL Anthology published version exists."}
