The LEX-GAN model takes the advantage of GAN in generating high-quality fake examples by substitute few works in original tweets.  It achieved excellent performance on two kinds of dataset. \n\nThe term \u2018layered\u2019 was a little confusing to me at the very beginning, though it is strengthened in many places around the paper. Maybe the author could use some other word to better summarize the two layers.\n\nAnother question is about the extended dataset with generated data, are they generated using the same distribution from G of the final model? What the result would it be if we use real, out-of-domain data?\n\nI would like to see this paper accepted to motivate future works on fake news detection and rumor detection..\n"}
