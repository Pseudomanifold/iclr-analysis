The second-order information can be backprogated just as the first-order ones, which can be used to accelerate training.\n\nThis idea, although according to the paper, is developed upon existing works, still, strongly attracts as the second-order information is crucial for training and perhaps visualizing the landscape of neural networks. I vote for an acceptance as this brings a significantly important feature to PyTorch, and the author's good experiments results and open-sourced code."}
