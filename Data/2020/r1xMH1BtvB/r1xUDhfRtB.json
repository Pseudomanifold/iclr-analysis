One inefficiency of BERT is that only 15% tokens are used for training in each example. The paper introduced a generator+discriminator framework to optimize the utility of training examples. The generator task is the MLM which predicts the masked word. The author adds a discriminator to further learn from the example by classifying each word to be either generated or original. In this way, more words can be used. This method looks as only adding the discrimination task after BERT pretraining task. But, the authors later show that the best GLUE scores can be obtained only when both generator and discriminator are co-trained. Moreover, the adversarial ELECTRA perform worse. All these observations are interesting. It will be helpful if the authors provide more empirical analysis why the adversarial ELECTRA perform worse or failed. Is it because the GAN is hard to train or the adversarial task doesn't fit the pretraining? \n\nOverall, I think this is a good paper. The studied problem is important, the idea is new and the experimental results are positive. Specifically, it shows that ELECTRA can outperforms BERT and match RoBERTa with less training time. But, it will be a big plus if the authors can show ELECTRA can outperform RoBERTa with the same amount of training time. Analysis are also provided to give audience insights in this method."}
