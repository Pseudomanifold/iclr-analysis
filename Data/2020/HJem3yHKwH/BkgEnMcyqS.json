It proposes to use ensembles of full precision and low-precision models in order to boost up robustness to adversarial attacks. It relies on the fact that low precision models are known to be more robust to adversarial attacks though performing poorly, while ensembling generally boosting up performance. \n\nI think the premise of the paper is quite clear, and the results seem to be intuitive.  At a high level one worry that I have is if ICLR is the right conference for this work. \n\nI would have expected maybe a more thorough empirical exploration. E.g. using resnets for ImageNet rather than AlexNet. Providing more baselines for the larger (and more reliable datasets) rather than MNIST which might be a bit misleading. I think the work does a decent job at looking at different number of components in the ensemble and analyzing the proposed method, but maybe not enough comparing and exploring other mechanism proposed as a defense for adversarial attacks. \n\nHowever I think the message is clear, the results seem decent and I'm not aware of this being investigated in previous works.
