The key idea is providing side information to identify the latent representation, i.e., essentially a prior conditioned on extra information such as labels and restricting the mapping to flows for being able to compute the likelihood. As the loglikelihood of a flow model is readily available, a direct approach can be used for learning that optimizes both the prior and the observation model.\t\n\nThe paper is very clear and very easy to follow. The idea is quite clear, and the direct approach is really attractive. Unfortunately, the experimental section is quite limited and does not fully study representational aspects. There is only an illustrative simulation on synthetic data, that in a sense verifies the theory. I was also not able to see the additional insight that the identifiability theory in 4.2 provides additional to Khemakhem et al. (2019). Please clarify.\n\nMy main concern is that this model is actually a supervised model that learns a mapping from u to x via z. Hence, the theoretical \u2018identifiability\u2019 guarantee needs to be stated with some care as this depends on the choice of an arbitrary u. For example if we set x = u, will learning take place? Please comment.  \n\nOverall, I like the approach but I am uncertain about the level of novelty. For such a paper, one should expect a much more involved computational study. In this respect, I feel that the paper could be accepted but it certainly feels as if it needs more computational results as otherwise the original contribution would be too incremental for ICLR standards. I am giving a provisional reject in the hope that the authors will provide convincing arguments about their original contributions for clarification.\n"}
