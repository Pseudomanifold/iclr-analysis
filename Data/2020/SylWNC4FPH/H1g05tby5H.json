However, the paper doesn't answer key questions about both the application and the models:\n\n1) There is no clear rationale on why we need a new model based on Transformers for this task. What was wrong with LSTMs/GRUs as they've been used extensively for recursive problems including operations on trees? Similarly, I'd have expected baselines that included those models in the evaluation section showing the differences in performance between the newly proposed Transformer model for trees and previously used methods.\n\n2) The evaluation metrics used while borrowed from the language or IR fields doesn't seem to translate to UI design. UI layout is about visual and functional representation of an application so if one is seeking to evaluate different models, they need to relate to those."}
