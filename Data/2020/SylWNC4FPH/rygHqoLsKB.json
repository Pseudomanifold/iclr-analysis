The authors formulate the problem as partial tree completion, and investigate a range of variations of layout decoders based on Transformer.\n\nThe paper proposes two models: Pointer and Recursive Transformer. The paper designs three sets of metrics to measure the quality of layout prediction based on the literature and the domain specifics of user interface interaction.\n\nThe writing quality is readable. The presentation is nice. The task of auto completion for UI layout design is relatively new.\n\nThe paper misses the key baseline in Bayesian optimisation using tree structure [1] which can perform the prediction under the tree-structure dependencies.\n\n[1] Jenatton, Rodolphe, et al. \"Bayesian optimization with tree-structured dependencies.\" Proceedings of the 34th International Conference on Machine Learning-Volume 70.
