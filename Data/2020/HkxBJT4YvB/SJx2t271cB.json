A very specific model that tries to find out the underlying dynamics of such a problem is proposed and is learned by minimizing a suggested objective that takes the strengths of previous approaches. The method is demonstrated in a synthetic dataset and IHDP dataset and shown to outperform other previous methods by a large margin.\n\nMy initial review was negative, but I changed my mind after reading a few papers in this area. It seems that explicit learning of underlying factors that are described in (Hassanpour & Greiner, 2019) is a nice idea and works well. My only concern is that the paper has a lot of overlap with (Hassanpour & Greiner, 2019), even using identical figures. I am not sure whether it is OK.\n\n"}
