The authors show that by leveraging this additional structure they can improve upon existing methods in both ITE and ATE\u2028\n\nThe main contributions of the paper are:\n* Highlighting the importance of differentiating between treatment and outcome inducing factors and proposing an algorithm to detect the two\n* Creating a joint optimisation model that contains the factual loss, the cross entropy (treatment) loss and the imbalance loss\n\nOverall, I like the paper quite a lot, I find it well-written and clearly motivated with a very nice experimental section that it is designed around understanding the behaviour of the proposed model.\n\nIn terms of suggestions, I think it will be very interesting to link the approaches using invariant causal representations with existing work in the Counterfactual Risk Minimization [1] literature and to mutualise the experimental setup. \n\n[1] Swaminathan, Adith, and Thorsten Joachims. \"Counterfactual risk minimization: Learning from logged bandit feedback.\" International Conference on Machine Learning. 2015."}
