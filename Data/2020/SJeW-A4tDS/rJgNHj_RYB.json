The model applies a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to analyze the bytes of the input files. The generated features of CNN achieves good clustering results that are consistent with the ground-truth labels.\n\nThis paper applies an existing CNN architecture. I do not observe any novelty in terms of modeling. I suspect this paper is not interesting to most members of the ICLR community. Therefore, I do not suggest the acceptance of this paper."}
