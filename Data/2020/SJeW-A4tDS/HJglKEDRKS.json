The authors created a dataset of malicious and benign PDFs to be able to train their model and compared against commercial Antivirus.\nThe paper \n\nReject: The paper lacks novelty and have very weak experiments. \n\nThe paper presents a simple application of a small CNN to PDF malicious classification, the main contribution of the paper is the dataset collected, which is not released for privacy reasons.\n\nThe experiments lack strong baselines, and comparisons with previous ML solutions, how important is the design of the CNN for this task.\n\nPrevious work like [12] have already applied the same idea to different but very similar task, malware detection of binary files.\n\nThe paper would be more useful for people working in malware detection if made available as a  tech-report.\n"}
