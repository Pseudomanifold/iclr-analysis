With this formulation, the optimal action (corresponding to the maximum action value) can be found by solving the optimization problem at each time step. To reduce the time complexity of the optimization, the author proposes several variants to approximately solve the problem. Results on robotics control are presented. The proposed looks interesting and could be useful in practice. \n\n1. Section 4 of the paper can be improved. Although the author proposes several methods for approximating the optimal solution, it is unclear what message the author wants to convey. How to decide which approximation to use? Is there any situation where one of the approximations should be preferred? \n\n2. In the experiments, the standard deviation is very large, so it is hard to claim the proposed method is better."}
