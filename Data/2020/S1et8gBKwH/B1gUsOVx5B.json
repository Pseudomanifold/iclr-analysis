Here, the label represents the geometry of the 2D rotation. The proposed method introduces two latent representation. z is the ordinal latent variable and r a latent representation for the rotations where the latent variable is defined in the 1-dimensional circle in R^2 so that it can naturally represent a hyperspherical latent space. \nThe construction of the proposed CVAE is straightforward. For labeled images, the (evidence lower bound of the) loglikelihood of the image-rotation pairs is maximized. For labeled images. For labeled images, the (evidence lower bound of the) loglikelihood of the images is maximized. \n\nThe decision of the reviewer of this paper is weak reject. The major reason is the lack of technical originality. The construction itself would be novel while each component (e.g., CVAE,  latent representation for the rotations, and semi-supervised construction of CVAE) have been already known.\n\nExperimental results are not surprising but show that the presented method is useful to some extent. In a sense, it is a bit disappointing that we need 50+% images needed to be labeled to achieve < 20-degree error. One interesting observation of this paper is that more labeled images give better results than giving greater number of renders. Expansion to 3D rotations would be a good challenge. \n\n"}
