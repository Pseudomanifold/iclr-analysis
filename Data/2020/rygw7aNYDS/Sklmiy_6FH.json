Specifically, the authors assume that we can collect $n$ data points $\\{(s_t,a_t,r_t(s_t,a_t),s_{t+1})\\}_{t=1}^{n}$. Based on the collected data, the authors calculated the sample mean of the unknown reward function $\\widehat r_n$ and transition probability $\\widehat{P}(\\cdot|s,a)$. They further defined an estimator $\\widehat Q_n$, which is the fixed point of the empirical Bellman operator $\\widehat{\\mathcal{T}}_n$ derived from $\\widehat r_n$ and $\\widehat P_n$. The authors proved under certain assumptions that $\\widehat Q_n\\rightarrow Q^*$ almost surely. Based on this argument, they also derived a similar convergence of value function $\\widehat V_n$ in distribution. Confidence intervals can also be established based on these results.\n\nThe proof of convergence in distribution is established based on the following idea: $\\widehat r_n$ and $\\widehat P_n$ converge to $r$ and $P$ by central limit theorem. By examining the Jacobian matrix of $\\widehat{\\mathcal{T}}_n$ with respect to $\\widehat Q$, it is found that the implicit function $\\widehat{ \\mathcal{T}}_n \\widehat Q -\\widehat Q=0$ can be solved in small neighborhoods of $\\widehat r_n, \\widehat P_n$ and $\\widehat Q_n$ as\n$$\n\\widehat{Q}_n = \\phi(\\widehat{r}_n, \\widehat P_n) \\qquad\\text{(implicit function theorem)}\n$$  \nThen by Slutsky theorem, $\\widehat Q_n = \\phi(\\widehat r_n, \\widehat P_n)$ also converges to $Q^*$ in distribution. The proof is straightforward and easy to follow. However, I have some concerns about the above analysis.\n\n1. The data $\\{(s_t,a_t,r_t(s_t,a_t),s_{t+1})\\}_{t=1}^{n}$ are collected by executing a fixed policy for n steps, which means the data points are not i.i.d. Therefore, the convergence of  $\\widehat r_n$ and $\\widehat P_n$ by central limit theorem may not hold ground, which further leads the later proofs potentially problematic.\n\n2. The $\\phi(\\cdot,\\cdot)$ function in implicit function theorem only exists in neighborhoods of $\\widehat r_n, \\widehat P_n$ and $\\widehat Q_n$. It is unclear from the current proof that $\\widehat Q_n$ fall into the same neighborhood of $Q^*$. Therefore, it needs to be justified that the limit point is $Q^*$.\n\n3. Even for the empirical estimator $\\widehat Q_n$, it is still the fixed point of $\\widehat{ \\mathcal{T}}_n$, which is hard to compute or solve. Thus Algorithm 1 may be inefficient in practice.\n\nOther comments:\n\nThe font and margin of this paper does not conform the format requirement of ICLR.\nWhat is $\\sigma_R(i,j)$ in Theorem 1 and Corollary 1? It seems to be undefined.\n\nI found it hard to read when the authors vectorize all the matrices and tensors to $N$ dimension vectors and $N\\times N$ matrices. In particular, the rearranged notations such $\\mu((i-1)m_a+j)$, $\\tilde P^{\\pi}((i-1)m_a+j,(i\u2019-1)m_a+j\u2019)$ are much more complicated that $\\mu(i,j)$ and $\\tilde P^{\\pi}(i\u2019,j\u2019|i,j)$. Similarly, the mapping $F(Q\u2019,r\u2019,P\u2019)$ defined in the proof of Theorem 1 can be represented by the Bellman operator $\\mathcal{T}$ defined on page 3. \n"}
