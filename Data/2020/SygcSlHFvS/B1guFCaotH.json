More specifically, the authors categorize the relations in KG into three categories (R, S, C) using the correlation between the semantic relation between two words and the geometric relationship between their embeddings. The authors utilize this categorization to provide a better understanding of LP models\u2019 performance through several experiments.\n\nThis paper reads well and the results appear sound. I personally believe that works on better understanding KGC models are a very essential direction which is mostly ignored in this field of study. Moreover, the provided experiments support the authors\u2019 intuition and arguments.\n\nAs for the drawbacks, I find the technical novelty of the paper is somewhat limited, as the proposed method consists of a mostly straightforward combination of existing methods. Further, I believe this work needs more experimental results and decisive conclusions identifying future directions to achieve better performance on link prediction. My concerns are as follows:\n\n\u2022    I am wondering about the reason for omitting Max/Avg path for two of the relations in WN18RR? Further, the average of 15.2 for the shortest path between entities with \u201calso_see\u201d relation appears to be a mistake?\n\u2022    Was there any specific reason in choosing WN18RR and NELL-995 KGs for the experiments?\n\u2022    It would be interesting to see the length of paths between entities for train and test data separately. \n\u2022    I suggest providing a statistical significance evaluation for each experiment to better validate the conclusions.\n\u2022    I find the provided study in section 4.2 very similar to the triple classification task in KGs. Can you elaborate on the differences and potential advantages of your setting?\n\u2022    I am wondering how you identified the \u201cOther True\u201d triples for WN18RR KG in section 4.2 experiments?\n\nOn overall, although I find the proposed study very interesting and enlightening, I believe that the paper needs more experimental results and decisive conclusions.\n"}
