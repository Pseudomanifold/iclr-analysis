It was an interesting read and I appreciate the authors trying to understanding the latent structure that has been encoded in these models. However, I am just not that sure how many take-aways we can get from this study. \n\nI am wondering how loose this categorization is , esp. for the important relations in practice. I\u2019d be also interested in seeing more results on Freebase (and possibly Wikidata) as those KG embeddings are usually more useful. As indicated in the Appendix, the paper mentiosns most of FB15k-237 datasets are in type C, so I am just not sure how many R/S relations are actually there.\n\nAlso, according to Table 3 and Table 4, I am not sure if there are any surprising findings from there. It seems that there is some randomness/noise, but MuRE generally works better than the others. It is true that DistMult works well on the R-type relations but it is not consistent between WN and NELL.\n\nIt\u2019d be useful to show results on more relations (and aggregated results in each category). \n\nIt'd be really great if the paper actually provides some insights on we can further improve these entity embeddings according to this categorization. \n"}
