By exploiting second order updates, z is optimized to allow for better training and performance of the generator and discriminator.\n\nPros:\n+ A relatively efficient way of exploiting second order dynamics in GAN training via latent space optimization.\n+ A good set of experiments demonstrating the superior performance of the proposed method on both large and small scale models and datasets.\n\nCons:\n- Lack of code\n\nComments:\nAll in all, this appears to be a solid contribution to the GAN literature, addressing some of the limitations of CS-GAN [1]. The lack of open source code accompanying the paper (in this day and age) does it a serious disservice. I have already tried and failed to replicate the cifar10 results. There appears to be some nuance in implementation that would probably clear up if the authors release their code along with the paper.\n\n[1] - http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/wu19d.html"}
