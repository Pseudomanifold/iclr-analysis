To address intrinsic protein structural heterogeneity, they explicitly model the imaging operation to disentangle the orientation of the molecule by formulating decoder as a function of Cartesian coordinates.\n\n- The problem and the approach are well motivated. \n\n- This reviewer has the following comments:\n1) VAE is known to generate blurred images. Thus, based on this approach, the reconstruction image may not be optimal with respect to the resolution which might be critical for cryo-EM reconstruction. What's your opinion?\n2) What's the relationship between reconstructed performance, heterogeneity of the sample and dimensions of latent space?\n3) It would be interesting to show any relationship, reconstruction error with respect to the number of discrete multiclass.  \n4) How is the proposed method generalizable?"}
