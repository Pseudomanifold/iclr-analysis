Differentiable probabilistic models of scientific imaging with the Fourier slice theorem. arXiv preprint arXiv:1906.07582.\n\nHow does your method compare to this paper? In Ullrich et al., they report \u201cTime until convergence, MSE [10^-3/voxel], and Resolution [Angstrom]). I think these statistics would be useful to report in your work, as they are more familiar with folks in the cryoEM field.\n\nIn Equation 3, how does one calculate Z, the normalization constant?\n\nFor the decoder, how large of the 3D space are you generating? What are the units? Are you using voxels to represent atomic density? What is the voxel size? Is it the same as on Page 11?\n\nI think more description of the neural network architecture would be useful (more than what is reported on page 12).\n"}
