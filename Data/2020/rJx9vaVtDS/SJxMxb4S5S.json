They use a counterfactual generator and counterfactual discriminator for the task. Generator is modeled as a multitask neural network and the discriminator is modeled as hierarchical network consisting of treatment and dosage discriminator.\nOverall, the model outperforms other baselines such as DRNet and GPS indicating improved dose-response estimation capabilities.\nPros:\nSignificant empirical advance? Did they solve a standing open problem?\nSignificant performance improvement   in defined metrics compared to previous methods such DrNet. This indicates the proposed methods are better for dose-response estimation.\nAny good practical outcome (code, algorithm, etc)?\nNovel neural network architectures used with counterfactual generator and counterfactual discriminator are interesting and these can be extended to other tasks.\nAre the experiments well executed?\nGood experiments in general. Source of gain experiment(section 6.2) provides deeper insight into why the model might perform better compared to other baselines.\n\nUseful for the community in general?\nYes it\u2019s useful for the community as this is a challenging problem and estimating dose-response from observational data(EHR) is tricky.\n\nCons:\nAny missing baselines? Missing datasets?\nMissing baselines: TARNET, MLP, GANITE, kNN, BART. These baselines were evaluated in DrNet paper.\nAny odd design choices in the algorithm not explained well?\nWhy did authors use GAN with Vanilla loss function while it has been shown that there are other loss functions which can help in improving the performance? Perhaps evaluating the GAN with other loss function can provide further insight to the stability of the model\n\nQuality of writing?\nThe overall flow of the paper is a little hard to follow. \n\nIs the model better in terms of stability?\nCompared to DrNet Paper, is the model easy to train? Since the model uses a GAN loss function which are known for being hard to train, it would be good to evaluate the model in terms of difficulty of training.\n\nIs there sufficient novelty in what they propose? Minor variation of previous work?\nWhile this is a very interesting task, this paper falls under incremental improvement as it improves GANITE framework to solve dose-response estimation. As authors use GAN for counterfactual estimation which is not novel(GANITE) and estimating dose-response estimation is not novel(DrNet). \nSpecific Points\nIn comparison to DrNet Paper(Learning Counterfactual Representations for Estimating Individual Dose-Response Curves)\nSquare root of MISE is different for the datasets. \nIs it because of different hyperparameters?"}
