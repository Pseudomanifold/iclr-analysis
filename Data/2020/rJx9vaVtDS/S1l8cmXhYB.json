This work is an extension of GANITE (Yoon et al., 2018) for the case of real-valued treatments (i.e., dosage). The proposed model consists of 3 blocks: (1) a generator, (2) a discriminator, and (3) an inference block. In this paper, GANITE\u2019s generator and discriminator architectures are modified to be able to handle real-valued treatments.\n\nThis paper should be rejected due to the following arguments:\n\t- Since the paper is based on GANITE, I\u2019m going to start my review by pointing out the problems/questions I have about GANITE. First, let me briefly summarize my understanding of this method: \n\t\t+ Given (x, t, yf), the generator G tries to estimate counterfactual outcomes (ycf). \n\t\t+ Given (x, (yf, ycf)), the discriminator D tries to figure out which outcome was factual.\n\t\t+ Yoon et al. (2018) claims that optimizing a GAN with this G and D, the generator will become better and better at estimating accurate counterfactual outcomes.\nLooking at the objective function in Eq. (4), it is not clear why D should learn to distinguish factual from counterfactual outcome as opposed to learning the treatment selection bias as t.log(D(x ,y))+... would suggest. Yoon et al. (2018) assume the former while the latter seems more plausible. Of course, a by-product of learning the treatment selection bias is distinguishing yf from ycf, however, this doesn\u2019t mean that G did a good job at generating an accurate estimation of ycf. \nIn summary, it seems that the adversarial training designed in GANITE and consequently DRGAN provide no advantage in terms of accurate estimation of counterfactuals, which in turn, nullifies the entire claimed contribution of these two works. I will, however, read the rebuttal carefully and am willing to modify the score if the authors address this major concern.\n\nReferences:\n\t- Yoon, J., Jordon, J., & van der Schaar, M. (2018).
