The basic idea is to conduct PCA on all the shapes with SDF as feature, and encode a shape by the eigenvectors from PCA. The authors present experiments on 3D reconstruction from 2D view and point clouds, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. I lean to vote for accepting this paper since the idea is simple but novel, and it achieves good performance.\nStrengths\n- The idea itself is simple and novel. The basic idea of this approach is simple -- keep most information / variance by using PCA, and it is also very novel, since I have not seen papers using PCA to encode 3D shapes.\n- The idea is effective. As the authors demonstrated in section 4, this approach works well, and it outperforms all other methods by a large margin according to Chamfer distance. This is impressive since such a simple method can improve the performance this much.\nWeaknesses\n- More analysis could be provided about how do the authors choose SDF. Choosing SDF here is obviously a reasonable choice, but is it the best? More analysis could be provided, or more experiments could be included.\nPossible Improvements\nAs mentioned above, more analysis about why choosing SDF or more experiments about comparing SDF to other representations under this PCA approach could be provided."}
