Then the paper provides several considerations about the connectivity scheme. Finally, the paper proposes a specific connectivity pattern that outperforms other ones.\n\nI am not exactly in this area, but the paper is frequently confusing and hard to read. If I understand correctly, Sec 5 proposes a method to evaluate topologies. It seems that this method is strongly tied to the proposed cascade architecture, therefore cannot compare cascade vs non-cascade. The choice of the matrix reconstruction problem looks arbitrary. The paper finishes very abruptly.\n\nAnother consideration is that evaluating on random matrices doesn't demonstrate the ability to solve real world problems. There are no experimentation on real benchmarks or comparison to prior work on sparse networks. It should be possible to compare to methods that sparsify networks after training as well as to methods that enforce sparsity during/before training.\n\nOther:\n- it is strange to call a method by the first name of the researcher (Xavier)\n- there are some grammatical mistakes and problems with articles"}
