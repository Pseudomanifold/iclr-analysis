The paper gives a theoretical justification of their method using matrix concentration inequalities and spectral perturbation bounds.\n\nStrengths:\n- A simple and effective technique to fool a large fraction of examples leveraging the observation that only a small number of dominant principal components exist for input-dependent attack directions.\n\n- Clean theoretical justification of the performance of the proposed methodology.\n\n- I also like the observation and the generality, simplicity, and theoretical proof of the proposed universal attack algorithm SVD-Universal.\n\nWeaknesses:\n- Performance seems to be inferior to previous methods e.g. Khrulkov & Oseledets 2018. The paper does not give a comparison between SVD-Universal and (p,q)-SVD.\n\n- Although the author gives a justification of why they do not compare with (p,q)-SVD, I still like to see a comparison between the two methods such that we can have a better idea about what is the potential performance loss by using the SVD-Universal when compared with (p,q)-SVD.\n\n- It is not clear to me how the authors build the matrix corresponding to the universal invariant perturbations in sec 6. \n"}
