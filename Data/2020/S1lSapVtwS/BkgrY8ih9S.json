Does the construction procedure for the basis, described under the theorem formulation, meet the conditions of Theorem 1? \n2) The Theorem 1 formulation states that \u201c If there exists a set of deterministic linear transforms\u201d. Should the linear independence be stated as well as one of the theorem conditions ( so that the space dimensionality would indeed be K)? \n3) The reviewer finds the structure of Section 4 confusing: it starts from the problem statement (first paragraph 'Using the method above, filters of each stochastic layer\u2026\u2019), then provides the description of the approach and only then outlines Theorem 1. It might be that stating Theorem 1 and then defining the method for generation of the basis (how exactly could we get to the basis? ) could improve readability of the paper. Essentially, the question is: is there any way to emphasise the procedure for filter generation and inform the reader in which circumstances these filters would be the basis (e.g. why it wouldn't be prone to the analogue of mode collapse when the filters do not effectively have enough diversity for linear independence)? \n***\nIn addition to this list, it might be useful to provide some evidence on whether there is any inherent mechanism to regulate the diversity of filters and therefore of samples (so that to change the variability of the conditional samples from the model with the impact analogous to the one of temperature in Glow (Kingma et al, 2018)). If there is one, further experimental evidence, which shows the impact on diversity of filters, would contribute to improvement of the paper.  \n"}
