Analysis of computational cost shows the proposed layer is cheaper than the convolutional layer. The experimental comparison demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method. In my viewpoint, the novelty of this paper is somewhat novel. \n\nThis paper focuses on designing the PDE layer to constrain the network output without additional loss. Some constraint sets for comparison are clearly performed and then authors present the proposed spectral projection layer. From the mechanism of solving, the FFT (IFFT) operator is important component in this layer. It is curious about the role and importance between FFT (IFFT) and spectral projection. If possible, the authors maybe provide some analyses of these two components to deeply recognize the proposed layer. \n\nA series of compared experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed PDEL. But it is a little confusing in Table 1, e.g., why the second column obtains the second better in the all mean values. I know its result has a high score of residue. It will be better if authors can clarify their causes and analysis clearly.\n"}
