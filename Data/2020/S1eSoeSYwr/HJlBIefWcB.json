The evaluation was performed on benchmark regression tasks. The comparison with other state-of-the-art methods was provided. The evaluation of the robustness against out of distribution and adversarially perturbed test data was performed.\n\nStrength:\n1. Experiments were complete. Analyses were provided with useful information.\n2. A model with smaller number of parameters was proposed.\n3. Computation efficiency was improved.\n\nWeakness:\n1. Total evidence and model evidence were defined. The derivation of these evidences should be clarified.\n2. Theoretical justification for related methods could be improved."}
