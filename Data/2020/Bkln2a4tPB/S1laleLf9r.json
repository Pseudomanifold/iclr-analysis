If I understood well, to get to this for, you would still need to multiply the input x_t by U^{-1}. Therefore, any MTDLS can be written in this simplified form, correct, for a given input x_{1:T}, the formulation using the diagonal is more restrictive I believe. U^{-1} x could be of this form, but not necessarily x.\n- in 2.3, the estimation of the posterior using your method of AIS with MoG seem quite involved, even though you mention it converges fast. What happened for simpler methods of estimating the posterior, did you see a drop in performance, run-tine only?\n\nOverall I think this is an interesting paper, however I am not familiar with all the related work."}
