The applied methods are introduced in detail. But it lacks some more detailed analysis.\n\nMy concerns are as follows.\n1. The performance differences between Evolutionary agent and EVO-NAS agent seem not significant. Please conduct additional statistical tests such as the Wilcoxon signed-rank test to verify the performance improvements are significant.\n2. Many studies have been conducted to automatically adjust control parameters such as crossover and mutation probabilities in evolutionary algorithm literature. It would be better to compare one of these approaches in the experiments."}
