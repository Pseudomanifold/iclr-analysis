The method consists of a neural network model that estimates a novel viewpoint either to the left or to the right of a given image. The two key insights of the proposed method is 1) to learn the weights of a t-shaped kernel when performing novel view synthesis, and 2) to estimate and use adaptive dilations on those kernels.\n\nThe proposed approach is sound and the evaluation methodology used is adequate. The technique proposed is somewhat related to the recent interest in the community to apply CNNs to non-regular grids [1,2,3].\n\nSec. 4.2 states that the proposed method outperforms other existing methods on monocular depth estimation, while the table seems to indicate that other methods (e.g., Wang et al. 2019) obtain a better a1 measure.\n\nI would refrain from calling a 0.004 increase in a1 \u201ca remarkable improvement\u201d (sec.
