This is an important problem as it enables 3D visualization of a 2D input scene. The paper focuses on the particular problem of generating a stereoscopic view from a single image (i.e., a right and left view from a center image). \nFor this purpose, the paper proposes a t-net architecture which is an autoencoder or U-net like architecture that estimates the values for the t-convolutions proposed in the paper. The network (called monster-net) takes a center image and a pan amount as input, and from those synthesizes the image with the respective view.\n\nThe paper demonstrates that their idea of t-convolutions outperforms recent competing approaches such as deep 3D on available datasets as well as on an in-house collected dataset. The figures provided demonstrate that the views generated by the proposed Monster-net visibly look slightly better than those generated by the competing approaches DeepD and SepConv. In addition, the paper is well written and easy to follows. I therefore recommend acceptance of this paper. I would like to emphasize that while I work in deep learning, I don't work on view synthesis and therefore it is difficult for me to evaluate the novelty of the proposed approach as well as the difficulty of the problem."}
