In particular, the paper tackles the problem of diversity promoting learning. Following (Liu et al., 2018), pairwise distances between parameters on hyperspheres are used in the regularization framework.\nThe topology of the parameter space is reformulated with multiple hypersphere spaces which are each defined by two parameters: the centroid of a sphere and its surface vector. Multiple strategies involving hierarchical hyperspherical structures are proposed in Section 3 (continuous and discrete). \nThe relevance of the proposed method is experimentally demonstrated on different computer vision datasets.\n\n\nI vote for reject for the following reasons:\n- The paper is hard to read in general. Although the method section is understandable, its readability could be improved because each method currently just looks like a succession of equations. The paper also does not really give an intuition of why (or what contexts) one of the proposed regularizers would be better than the others. \n- The reported (test accuracy) scores do not seem significantly better than the l2 baseline: none of the reported scores beats the l2 baseline by at least 1 percent, and it is unclear how that difference is measurable. How many splits/different initalizations were used? Why not give standard deviation over different test splits? etc... Given the fact that the improvements do not seem significant compared to a single baseline, a proper evaluation with standard deviation should be provided.\n- Although the paper cites (Liu et al., 2018) as motivation for their framework, why does the proposed method does not compare to the other related work (i.e. works by Xie)?\n\nAs a side note, the paper seems to motivate the use of multiple spherical spaces to represent hierarchies. Recent work in machine learning has shown the advantage of using hyperbolic geometry [A,B] to represent trees, hence hierarchies. \n\n\n[A] Nickel and Kiela, Poincar\u00e9 Embeddings for Learning Hierarchical Representations, NIPS 2017\n[B] Ganea et al., Hyperbolic Neural Networks, NeurIPS 2018"}
