Through regularization of as designed in level-wise, group-wise with the hierarchy of network, in their experiments with classification dataset, better performance are achieved with various distance. \n\nPros:\n1: I think the paper is well organized and motivated, the regularization of parameters in deep neural network is one of the center problem for effective learning. \n2: The proposed strategy is effective with their experiments, various datasets and objective metrics are adopted to validate the regularization.  Combination ablation study is sufficient.\n\nCons:\n1: The paper is also related with several popular normalization strategies such as weight normalization/standardization, group/batch normalization. It would be more convincing that some comparison could be performed against these strategies.\n2: There would be better to show its performance using larger dataset such as ImageNet or COCO detection.\n"}
