I liked the idea of using some form of linearization of the Fisher information matrix to learn a feature vector. The connection to tangent plane ideas in terms of robustness also made sense. The issue I have is what layer to apply this idea to and formally relating this idea to the variational VAE type framework. Using the top layer seems arbitrary. Also using one layer seems arbitrary. Is there a way to argue via a perturbation analysis of the variational problem of what makes the most sense. I feel the paper hints at this but does not make this idea explicit. "}
