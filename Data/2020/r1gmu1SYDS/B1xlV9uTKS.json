They also evaluate their theoretical observations via several experiments.   \n1. Optimizers heavily influence the performance of a given learning problem in vision task. So, our question is that whether the optimizers or other hyperparameters could influence the computation of OMI scores.  \n2. Although the authors apply the bayesian hyperparameter optimization techniques to mitigate the bias that introduced by the hyperparameters,   the adopted bayesian hyperparameter optimization technique can not find the optimal parameters and different hyperparameter optimization techniques maybe provide different hyperparameters.  \n"}
