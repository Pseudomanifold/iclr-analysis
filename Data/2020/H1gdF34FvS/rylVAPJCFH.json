The contribution should be articulated more carefully, though, taking into account that most algorithmic ideas are present in prior work (https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1gdF34FvS&noteId=Bkxi11nsdr). Perhaps, the experience replay part is somewhat novel. It seems emphasizing more that the aim is to show that simple methods are competitive rather than focusing on novelty could be a good idea.\n\nProvided that the authors incorporate the feedback of the other reviewers and update the paper accordingly, it will make a good contribution.\n"}
