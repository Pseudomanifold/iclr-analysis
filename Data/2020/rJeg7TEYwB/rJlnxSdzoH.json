One of their drawbacks is that, due to having to consider all scattering paths (all possible combination of wavelets coming from each layer) their space complexity scales exponentially with the depth of the network.\n\nThe paper proposes a simple scheme for pruning the contributing wavelets so as to retain only those that are best aligned with the input signal of the given layer. The experiments show that this leads to scattering networks that perform about equally well, but are much sparser.\n\nIt is not entirely clear why alignment with the input signal should be a good proxy for how informative a given wavelet is. Depending on what downstream algorithm the scattering network's output is fed into, sometimes small coefficients could be important too. It might be unfair to only use an SVM in the experiments, since for SVMs larger magnitude features are important more likely to be relevant.\n\nSome stability results are presented, but they are not terribly deep, and do not address the fact that the optimization is problem is highly nonlinear and therefore even after relatively small perturbations drastically different sets of wavelets may be selected. Nonetheless, this is an interesting contribution to the field of graph scattering networks.", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I assessed the sensibility of the derivations and theory."}
