The intuition based on standard GAN is straightforward and makes sense. The paper is well written, especially the case studies illustrate the idea clearly. The designing of p_{\\bar{d}} also presented the limitation of this method. Two main discussed applications, semi-supervised learning and novelty detection are important in machine learning. In general, this is an interesting paper.\n\nHowever, my concern is about the experiments. As a generative model for unseen data, I would like to see the generated results, which is more convincing. Only the 1/7 examples of MNIST dataset are provided in case studies. I am wondering for more complicated images, how is the performance?\n", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I assessed the sensibility of the derivations and theory."}
