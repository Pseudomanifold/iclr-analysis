Such a network achieves the best certified accuracy against l_infty adversaries at large epsilons on MNIST and CIFAR10, but the certified accuracy is still far from satisfaction. With the results from this paper, we can at least make sure the interval-certified ReLU networks is able to fit the robust classifier with arbitrarily small error if it exists. \n\nI did not check the details of the proofs, but I think such a theorem is a great reference for future work. \n\nHowever, we cannot conclude whether a network with a moderate size exists to fit the robust classifier well from this paper. From the construction of local bumps (nmin), the number of neurons needed to represent a bump function grows exponentially with the input dimension, which makes the size of the network vacuously large when the input is images. We are not getting any closer to improving the certified robustness with this paper."}
