To capture the local context of a word, they apply Gaussian blurring on output layers of the self-attention layer in BERT. The authors show their model\u2019s performance on GLUE and HANS dataset.\n\nStrengths\n*This paper claims the importance of the local context of a word and shows an effect of their method on the various datasets: GLUE, and HANS.\n\nWeaknesses\n* It seems like the self-attention layer can learn the local context information. Finding important words and predicts contextual vector representation of a word is what self-attention does.\nSo, if using local-context information, which is information in important near words, is an important feature for some downstream tasks, then the self-attention layer can learn such important near words by training the key, query, and value weight parameters to connect the near important words.\nIt would be nice if the authors provide some evidence that self-attention can't learn such a local-context feature.\n\n*In table 1, their experimental results show a slight improvement by using their method, but it's not significant.\n\n* On HANS dataset, they show using local-context can prevent models from easily adopting heuristics. How Gaussian blurring can prevent that problem? More explanation about the relation between local-context and adopting heuristics is required.\n\n\n\n"}
