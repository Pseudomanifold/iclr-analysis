The paper seems technically sound but it is not easy to read. Even Section 2 it is difficult to read.\n \n-  Main drawback: Please define the weights w_i of Eq. (5) in Section 2. \n\n- I have a question: is it possible to extend your work considering Multiple Importance Sampling and Generalized  Multiple Importance Sampling  schemes? please discuss.\n\n\n"}
