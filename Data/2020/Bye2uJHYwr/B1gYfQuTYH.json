It wants to construct the unbiased estimator of the true risk for the target domain based on data from the source domain. To have the unbiased estimator, samples in the source domain are weighted based on some auxiliary information of both the source domain data distribution and the target domain data distribution. Especially, similar to previous works, the paper first assumes P(Y=1) is known for the target domain, and give a generalization bound for learning on the target domain. Then they consider two more concrete problems, one is learning with stratified information when the conditional probability given the stratified information of the source domain is equal to that of the target domain. Then the paper considers PU learning. Generalization bounds are also given for these two problems. Finally, the paper shows some empirical results showing the reweighting effect of its proposal. \n\nThe paper is a theoretical study of transfer learning, and a generalization of other learning problems including transfer learning, learning from stratified data and PU learning. It assumes that when some auxiliary information is known, generalization bound can be given by only minimizing a reweighted loss of the biased source domain data. However, the auxiliary information proposed in this paper is difficult to be got. Thus, the practical use of this paper may be limited. The paper also lacks discussion with related theoretical work (such as generalization bound of PU learning). Due to these reasons, I rate a weak reject for the paper.\n\nIn Sec. 2, to have an unbiased risk estimator as well as a generalization bound, the prior probability P(Y=1) should be known. However, the paper fails to provide any practical way to estimate this value. Although in the auxiliary part, some results when such a value cannot be accurately estimated are given, estimation methods are also required for the method to be practical. Moreover, such as result is already studied in Sugiyama et al. (2008). Thus, the novelty of this part is limited. \n\nIn Sec. 3.1, the paper focuses on the learning from stratified data problem, when some stratified information s for the data are given. The paper further assumes P(x|S=k) = P(x\u2019|S\u2019=k). First, in a general learning problem, no matter transfer learning or not, only information of x and y is available. To justify that the information s is available, some real applications should be given as motivations. Moreover, the assumption on the stratified data, i.e. P(x|S=k) = P(x\u2019|S\u2019=k) and P(S=k) \\neq P(S\u2019=k) should also be justified. \n\nIn Sec. 3.2, the generalization bound of PU learning is also studied before in for example [Niu et al., Theoretical Comparisons of Positive-Unlabeled Learning against Positive-Negative Learning. NIPS 2016]. Discussion on the relationship between these theoretical results should be given. Also, in the experimental part, there is no empirical results comparing the proposed method with the existing PU learning methods. Since one of the main contributions of this paper is on PU learning, empirical studies should also be provided to show the superior of the proposed method. \n\n"}
