This Harmonic convolution are like a weighted combination of dilated convolutions with different dilation factors/anchors.  The authors show that for noisy audio signals, randomly initialized/untrained U-Nets with harmonic convolutions can yield cleaner recovered audio signals than U-Nets with plain convolutions or dilated convolutions.  The authors beat a variety of audio denoising tasks on a variety of metrics for speech and music signals.  The authors also show that harmonic convolutions in U-Nets are better than plain and dilated convolutions in U-Nets for a particular sound separation task.\n\nI recommend a weak accept for this paper because a new architecture for audio priors was presented, with reasonable empirical data supporting that this architectural choice an improvement over other more immediate alternatives.  It is important to extend the work on deep nets for imaging to other domains, such as audio. My recommendation is not stronger because of the following concerns. \n\nI think the paper could be strengthened by\n(a) a comparison to other methods (outside the current framework) for sound separation\n(b) a significant clarification of Figure 4.  The authors claim that this data shows that Harmonic Convolutions produce a \"cleaner signal faster\" than other methods.  When I look at Figure 4abcd, it appears that the Convolution and Dilated Convolutions fit a clean signal faster (it is just not as clean.  Additionally, the Wave-U-Net appears to reach the same accuracy as the Harmonic Convolution with many fewer iterations (while also continuing to get much higher PSNRs).  Perhaps I am misreading this plot, but it is not obvious to me that this plot supports the claims the authors are making.\n(c) The authors should present what they mean by a dilated convolution using the notation of the paper.  \n(d) In Figure 2, it is unclear to me how the 1/f^2 law is observed in (a) but not in (c) or (e)."}
