The paper focuses on two major applications: background/foreground extraction and video classification. The paper proposes a method that first obtains latent vectors from a video sequence by training a neural network and then applies dynamic mode decomposition (by Schmidt, 2010). \n\nThe paper is not well written and even after reading it the second time I, unfortunately, have difficulties understanding the exact contributions and experiments.\nHere are concrete examples that lead to this critique:\n- Section 2: Letters are not defined (e.g., \\mathcal F is not defined when first used), and sentences are not finished and/or do not make sense.\n- Sec. 5.1: not clear whether the experiment is only done for one sequence or for many. If done on only one sequence, this is not sufficient to demonstrate that the method works well, if done on more than one then the results are not reported.\n- Conclusion: States that ``this method can be applied to any multivariate-time series data to extract complex and non-linear dynamics''. That statement sounds overlay general given the experimental evaluation."}
