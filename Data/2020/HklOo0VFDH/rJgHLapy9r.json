Because exact decoding of ARMs is computationally difficult, the contribution of this paper is to introduce a new approximate solution. The authors show experimentally that this new framework is very effective and outperforms multiple baselines such as greedy and bean search and another text filing algorithm called TIGC on a text-filling benchmark. This work is not in my domain of expertise so I am not able to have a very accurate evaluation. However, based on the references cited in this paper, there are other approximate solution for ARMs and I believe the authors need to use those as baselines to show that the proposed approximate solution is useful."}
