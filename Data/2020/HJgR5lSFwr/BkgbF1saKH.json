Previous variational lower bounds for mutual information either have a large variance (NWJ) or have an upper bound (ICE). The author address the problem by introducing a parameter q and defining q-algebra. The previous variational lower bounds are special case when q approaches to 1. Some experiments were conducted to show that the proposed variational lower bounds have smaller variance and can achieve high values.\n\nIn general, this paper is well-written. The motivation, definition, solution and experiments are well organized to support the claims. However, there are some questions about the paper.\n\n(1) The authors derived the variational lower bound based on q-algebra without any proof. For example, in (13), they simply claimed that D_KL{q} (p(x|y) || \\hat{p}(x|y)) >= 0. Before (16), they simply claimed that log_q Z_q(y) \\leq Z_q(y)/a(y) + \\log_q a(y) - 1, for any x, q, a(y) > 0. This inequalities are well-known without q algebra, but not well-known with q algebra. I think proofs should be included in the appendix.\n\n(2) Some key details of the experiments are missing. For example, what is the value of q in Figure 2? What is the dimension of X in Figure 2? How will Figure 2 change if the value of q and the dimension of X change? Especially, the value of q is the most important parameter which should be well studied in the experiment."}
