The paper presents theoretical derivations that look sound, and validating experiments on synthetic and real data. I must say my expertise does not really correspond to what is done in this paper, but I do not see any obvious flaws and the results look solid. I appreciated the discussion of limitations in section 6. I vote for acceptance with the weakest possible confidence level since it is likely I missed many important points. "}
