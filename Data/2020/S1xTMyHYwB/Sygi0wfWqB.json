This paper proposed a random weight deconvolution architecture and show the reconstruction results for an autoencoder is good.\n2. The paper is largely based on https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6568-a-powerful-generative-model-using-random-weights-for-the-deep-image-representation.pdf, so the contribution is somewhat limited.\n3. Given the paper by He et al. it's not surprising to prove the theorems for deconvolution networks.\n4. Empirically the authors have shown the usefulness and also proved the effect of depth, number of channels and kernel sizes.\n5. The style transfer application is out of place and may be removed."}
