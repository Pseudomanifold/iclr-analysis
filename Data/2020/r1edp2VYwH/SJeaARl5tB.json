The main contribution is a light stemmer that only removes affixes to the extent that the original semantic information in the word is kept after stemming. The approach relies on curated prefixes, suffixes and some rules. Both intrinsic evaluation and extrinsic evaluation (sentiment classification) are done to show the effectiveness of the stemmer. Overall, the approach is reasonable and the results are good. However, I'm not sure that ICLR is the best venue for publishing this work, since it mainly focuses on linguistics and text processing; ACL might be a better fit for this work.\n\nExperiments:\n- I did not find a description of the baseline HornMorpho. How is it different from the proposed approach? Does it use the same text preprocessing as the proposed stemmer?\n- It looks like sentiment classification is done by looking up a lexicon. What if a classifier is used? How does stemming affect it?\n\nStyle:\n- The paper does not strictly follow the ICLR style. The fonts aren't consistent. \n- Figure 1 has very low resolution.\n- I'd suggest the related work section be broken into several paragraphs.\n"}
