As the authors point out, Amharic is a language with considerable complexity and richness in its mophological/orthographic processes, and effective stemming therefore is potentially useful for downstream applications. The approach presented is a cascade of transformations that standardize the form, remove suffixes, prefixes, and infixes. An analysis is offered in terms of accuracy in recovering the stems, as well as when using the stems to drive a stem-based sentiment analyzer, with comparison to another existing stemmer.\n\nAlthough this is a reasonable approach to the stemming problem in Amharic, some suggestions would be:\n1) Compare to approaches to root finding that exist in Arabic and Hebrew, which have certain similarities in morphology, and which have been widely published on.\n2) Dictionary-based sentiment analysis can be useful application, but demonstration of improvements on several applications would be far more compelling (e.g., there are Amharic-English parallel corpora available, so using this as a preprocessing step for a machine translation system would be useful).\n\nOverall though, this paper does not focus on representation learning, and as such probably would be better suited to a different venue."}
