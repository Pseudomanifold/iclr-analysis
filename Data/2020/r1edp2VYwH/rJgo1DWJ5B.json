The system consists of a cascade of small subsystems, and each of them was developed to normalize a specific characteristics on Amharic words using a hand-crafted algorithms.\n\nThis paper may not be fully relevant to this conference because most of the main methodology does not rely on any representation learning criteria, but is almost rule-based. I recommend authors to consider submitting this paper to some appropriate conferences rather than here (e.g., ACL, NAACL, or EMNLP are the best for you), since the paper should get more meaningful attention and reviews form researchers in natural language processing.\n\nPresentation errors:\n- The paper changes the font of English characters from section 3.2.\n- Figure 1 looks to have insufficient resolution."}
