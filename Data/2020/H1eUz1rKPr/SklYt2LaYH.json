With the motivation from fuzzy set theory, both the multiset representation and predicting symmetric difference sizes given these representations are formulated.\n\nIn Section 3.3, authors stated that theorem 3.3.1 provides the compelling reason to use symmetric difference over intersection or non-symmetric difference. The statement seems not so straightforward, and how it works as the learning criterion for semi-supervised clustering in the experiments. \n\nFor the relaxation used for the normalization of \\phi(a), does this restrict the feasible space of the standard basis vectors? In Section 4.3, authors claimed that in the case of n=3, 98.9% classification accuracy can be obtained by simply picking the maximum valued coordinate of the representation of each object. A systematic comparison in terms of the classification accuracy is important for evaluating the semi-supervised clustering problem. \n\nIn Section 4.2, authors directly model the mean absolute errors in symmetric difference size prediction. It might be more interesting to see what real problems the proposed model can naturally be applied."}
