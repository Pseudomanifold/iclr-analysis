The authors show that the proposed QUERY2BOX achieves the performance improvement in answering EPFO queries, as well as handling complex queries that is not observed in the training data. Experimental results show the efficacy of the proposed model. In general, I like the paper due to the nice presentation and promising approaches. However, I am not familiar with the context of KGs. I could not find anything wrong with this paper, but also do not have many intelligent questions to ask.  My only concern is the comparison experiments. The authors only presented the experiments using one baseline model GQE over two benchmark datasets. The authors may want to conduct more comparison experiments with the recent advances (e.g., Guu et al., 2015; Das et al., 2017) mentioned in the paper.  "}
