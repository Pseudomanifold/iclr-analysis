It further extends the theoretical\u00a0finding in [1] about the low-pass filtering functionality\u00a0of graph convolutional networks and shows its advantage in dealing with graph signal processing problem. Evaluation of the proposed method is performed on 7 datasets for node classification task.\nPros:\n1. This work goes into detail of the theoretical finding of SGC.\n2. Authors conduct extensive experiments on multiple datasets.\nCons:\n1. The proposed graph neural network mode is an extension of the existing model SGC, which address the limitation of SGC to model the node feature nonlinearity. It is a good extension, but the novelty is limited.\n2. Authors further extend the theoretical finding in [1] and verify the fact that low-pass filtering\u00a0functionality of graph neural network provide better noise robustness\u00a0than two layer MLP. It has some novelty, but the novelty is incremental.\n3. In the experiment, the performance gap between SGC and gfNN is very small on noise robustness study and traditional node classification. The performance gap between GCN and gfNN is also small on noise robustness study is also small, which can not\u00a0support the conclusion \"GCN has a risk of overfitting to the noise\"\n4. The paper has the problem of notation missing, e.g on page 2, Fig1 is never mentioned; on page 7, the notation of \"LG\" is missed in Fig 5.\n5. The code link is given but no code is missing.\n[1]Wu, Tianyi Zhang, Amauri Holanda de Souza Jr., Christopher Fifty, Tao Yu, and Kilian Q.Weinberger. Simplifying graph convolutional networks.
