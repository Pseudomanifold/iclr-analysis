Besides, the authors propose a simplified GCN-framework named gfNN, which is demonstrated on various benchmark datasets.  To be honest, the paper is well-motivated, well-written. And,  I enjoyed reading through the paper. \n\nHowever, I have some concerns regarding the technical contributions of this paper.\n(1) \"GNN is a low-pass filter\" is not a new observation. Various works (SGC, [Shuman, et al., 2013]) have studied this observation before. \n(2) If the frequency of the label vector is higher than the threshold of the low-pass filter (e.g., gfNN), will the model be problematic? \n(3) It seems the only difference between SGC and gfNN is that gfNN is equipped with one more hidden layer. The authors claim that gfNN perform better than SGC is because \"the true features are non-linearly separable\". If it is the case, then the technical contribution of gfNN is trivial. \n\nOverall, I still like this paper due to its interesting point of the presentation. I vote for weak accept, but I am fine if it is rejected. "}
