It makes an original approach to this problem. In-depth theoretical results are provided in supplementary material. Good attention is also paid to hyper-parameter tuning.\n\nHowever, some parts can be clarified and improved:\n\n- In the introduction a number of phrases should be clarified: \nit is not entirely clear what the meaning is of the input and output of the problem, input covariance and output precision matrix. In the part of related works, it is difficult to understand in this stage why RNN and deep Q-learning is related to the scope of the paper.\n\n- It is not clear whether section 2 contains new elements or whether the new contribution is entirely in section 3. \n\n- Please motivate the use of CNN in section 3.1. Why are convolutional layers important within this context?\n\n- eq (6): the methodology of this formulation can be better positioned with respect to the existing literature. It appears to be based on principles of synchronization and consensus (in the term ||Z - Theta||_F). Additional explanation and references are needed at this point.\n"}
