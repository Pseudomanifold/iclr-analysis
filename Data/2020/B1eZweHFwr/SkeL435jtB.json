However, I do not believe this paper is qualified for publishing in ICLR. Below please find my comments:\n\nDifferent from change-pixel attack, the certification for rotation/brightness change in image classification, volume and pitch change in audio perturbations is much easier. The studied perturbation can be parameterized by a very low dimension vector (i.e. one dimension (angle and volume) for image rotation and volume change, 3 dimensions (brightness for each channel) for brightness perturbation). To certify this attack, given a base classifier, we can simply do, for example, grid search, on the low dimensional space to find the worst case with very good accuracy. And it should be able to give much better than the randomized smoothing method.\n\nOne contribution of this paper is in that: Theorem 3.2 is valid for random smoothing using gaussian with general covariance matrix. However, the effectiveness of using a general covariance matrix is not studied. In the experiment section, I find only isotropic ones are used."}
