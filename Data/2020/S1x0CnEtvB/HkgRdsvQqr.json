The paper consists of detailed narrative about how these procedure are conducted, but still, it is really hard for me to find the true merit to appreciate, and why this brings a nontrivial and usefull contribution. The tables, visualization figures also didnot imply too much about whether this is more than overfitting on previous works with hand-chosen depth. "}
