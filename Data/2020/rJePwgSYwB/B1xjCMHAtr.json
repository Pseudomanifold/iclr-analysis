The title of this work is SGD LEARNS ONE-LAYER NETWORKS IN WGANS. And the authors claim that they analyze the convergence of stochastic gradient descent ascent for Wasserstein GAN on learning a single layer generator network. But actually this paper only considers two kinds of simplified discriminators: a (rectified) linear discriminator and quadratic discriminator, which are very different from WGAN used in practice. The analysis of two special cases are hard to be extended to the analysis of WGAN and thus can hardly help to explain why WGAN is successfully trained by SGD in practice.\n\nIn section 3, the authors consider the rectified linear discriminator, which is quite similar to the standard two layer network with relu activation but the first layer is fixed. The authors prove that the generator can learn the marginal distribution but may not learn the joint distribution. In the beginning of section 4, the authors explain that this is because there is no interaction between different coordinates of the random vector. To learn joint distribution, the authors extend the linear discriminator to the quadratic discriminator and think of it as a natural idea.\n\nFor the rectified linear discriminator, the regularization of the discriminator is the norm the output layer of discriminator which can be related to the Lipschitz constraint in WGAN. But for quadratic discriminator, I cannot understand how this setting can be treated as WGAN without further explanation from the authors.\n\nI wonder why this work doesn\u2019t consider the standard two layer network discriminator which also has the interaction between different coordinates in the first layer.\n"}
