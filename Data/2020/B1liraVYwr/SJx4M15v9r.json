The authors take advantage of an energy based model to measure the distance between a predicted response and the center of all qualified responses. The training process becomes a hybrid one with the original loss function in the beginning followed by the loss that pulls the response to the center of the response cluster later. In general the paper is well written, with experiments clearly showcased improved training stabilities. However, one major flaw in the experiments in that the authors almost only compared diversity measures such as Dist-1, Dist-2 and Ent4. These measures did not take into consideration the matches between the predicted one and the ground truth. The only relevance measure used in this paper is the  Rel., which the authors defined as the average of embedding distances. Such a measure is by no means an objective measure and can't really demonstrate the effectiveness of the model in terms of generating responses that are close to the ground truth. The authors would need to submit results on one of the widely adopted benchmark metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROGUE) or their equivalents in order to demonstrate the quality of the generated response. And this is the main reason of my rating recommendation. \n"}
