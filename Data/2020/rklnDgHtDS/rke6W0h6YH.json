The proposed method is designed to leverage compositionality.  The key idea of the proposed method is to enable the network to represent syntactic and semantic knowledge separately. This allows the neural network to leverage compositionality for knowledge transfer while alleviating catastrophic forgetting.\nThe experiments showed that their method performed significantly better results than baseline methods.  The method was tested on two different datasets, e.g., instruction Learning and machine translation.\n\n\n*Decision and supporting arguments\n\nI think this paper has enough quality to be be accepted as a conference paper.\nThe main reasons of my decision are two-folds.\nFirst, the proposal is quite insightful. The separation of semantics and syntax of an input sentence for using compositionality is an excellent idea.\nSecond, the proposed method improved the performance on two dataset significantly. This supports the usefulness of the idea.\n\n\n*Additional feedback\n\nMy concern is about evaluation. Table 1 shows the significant difference between the proposed method and the baseline methods. It looks to nice. But, this suggests that the datasets might be too artificial for this evaluation. To my understanding, both of the datasets are artificial to some extent. Hopefully, the method should be evaluated on the more realistic dataset.  \n"}
