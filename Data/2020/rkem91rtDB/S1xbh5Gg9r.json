Given an input graph, SEED proceeds in 4 steps, namely Sampling subgraphs, Encoding sampled subgraphs using autoencoder, aggregating subgraphs' Embedding Distribution into a vector representation.  Theretically, a connection between proposed SEED and the graph isomorphism is established. Experimentally, simulation on DEEZE and MUTAG datasets validated the effectivety of the proposed graph learning framework.  \n\nPro:\nThe paper is well structured and easy to follow.  Experiments appears convincing, especially the t-SNE plots when varying the number of subgraph samples.\n\nCon:\nIt would be better if experiments can be conducted on a few more benchmark datasets used in the compared methods.\n\nMinor:\nLast sentence in Page 6: each component have been -> each component has been\nthe 5-th sentence in Sec. 4.3, focusing -> focuses\nthe 7-th sentence in Sec. 4.3, At the meantime -> In the meantime"}
