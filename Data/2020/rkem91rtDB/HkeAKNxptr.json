The most innovative part in this paper is random walks with earliest visiting time (WEAVE) in the sampling part. WEAVE has potential power for capturing structure difference and could reflect isomorphism as well. Instead of using language model like word2vec, encoding part leverages MLP to get the embedding of each WEAVE, which is efficient and intuitive. Then, the group of encoding results from all WEAVEs are aggregated with kernel functions, generating the final embedding of a graph. This method achieves better accuracy in both clustering and classification tasks than previous ones including GraphSAGE, GMN and GIN.\nThis method uses an elegant way to embed graphs in an unsupervised manner, and the new random walk approach provides insights into graph structure encoding. Factors like walk length and number of walks are strictly derived then well examined in real experiments.\nQuestions & suggestions:\n1 In WEAVE encoding part, the paper doesn\u2019t show how much the earliest visiting time information improve the model. In another word, if we leave out the timing term (x_t^{(p)}), will the model still perform well?\n2 In embedding distribution part, it seems that only identity kernel is easy to calculate. For commonly adopted kernels, the MLP is \u201cmimicking the behavior of a kernel\u201d, so it will still be limited by the kernel you choose in MMD. There are some statistical approaches to estimate \u0424(z) like Nystrom method, maybe that will be another solution other than taking average."}
