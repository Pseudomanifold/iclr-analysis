It passes a single minibatch of training data through randomly initialized networks and gauging their Fisher potential. \nThe teacher-student network is used here to learn compressed network on a budget. They conduct various experiments, including cifar-10, imagenet, and coco-detection. All the experiments show the advance of proposed model, which is quite remarkable.\nOverall, this paper is well organized, and very well written. The insightful experiments thoroughly discuss and compare the proposed method. \n"}
