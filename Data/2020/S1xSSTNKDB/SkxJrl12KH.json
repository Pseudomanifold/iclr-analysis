The authors define 7 race groups: White, Black, Indian, East Asian, Southeast Asian, Middle Eastern, and Latino. Images were collected from the YFCC-100M Flickr dataset and labeled with race, gender, and age groups. The authors find that the model trained on the proposed dataset is substantially more accurate on novel datasets and the accuracy is consistent across race and gender groups. The authors also compare several commercial computer vision APIs and report their balanced accuracy across gender, race, and age groups.\n\nThe writing and presentation are good and easy to follow.\n\nMy concerns regarding this paper are as below.\n1) The main contribution of this paper is the dataset for face attribute analytics. And I acknowledge the authors' efforts to the whole community. However, for ICLR submission, this is not enough, missing some novel contributions on the level of methodology.\n2) How did the authors handle noise during construction of the proposed dataset?\n3) What are the resolution comparison statistics between the proposed dataset and others?"}
