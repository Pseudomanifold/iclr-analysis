To achieve this, they train several critics based on Fisher GAN. The method is evaluated based on classification and retrieval tasks. \nThe representation, by construction, is aimed towards interpretation and is specially useful in multi-class classification tasks. \nHere are my concerns:\n- Since the environments are taken randomly in the experiments, it is not investigated how sensitive the method is with respect to the choices of environments. Also, does it make any sense to design environments to include related (and not random) classes?\n- It seems necessary to include some experiments to assess sensitivity of the interpretation with regard to the small perturbations that are not changing the class label.
