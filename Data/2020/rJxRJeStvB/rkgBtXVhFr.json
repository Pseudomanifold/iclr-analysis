They state the method's scalable performance and transferability. My major concerns are as follows.\n\n1. The paper is not easy to read. In my understanding, multi-robot scheduling is a very important problem and is very similar to many scheduling problems in complex platforms such as the dispatch system for ride sharing and package delivery. However, I did see any real application in this paper. It is very difficult to understand how this proposed method works and what is the benefit under non trivial environment.\n\n2. The experiments (2~8 robots, 20~50 tasks) cannot support the scalable performance or large problems very well. How about thousands and millions of robots/tasks, e.g. routing planning or dispatching for vehicles in a ride sharing platform?  \n\n3. It is not convincing without comparison with necessary baseline methods.\n\n4. There is no in-depth analyses for the transferability.\n\n5. There are many typos, such as the missing figure citation with Figure ??.   \n"}
