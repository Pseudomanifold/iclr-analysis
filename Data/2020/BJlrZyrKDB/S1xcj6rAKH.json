It also gives theoretical analysis on its consistency in Theorem 1, and run a few simulations to show the empirical performance of the proposed method.\n\nThe method proposed seems to be novel and reasonable. As a result, I tend to accept this paper. However, I would like to remark that solving (4) might be empirically difficult (depending on the size of the problem) even though it is convex and can be solved in polynomial time theoretically. I wonder if the authors could clarify the setup of their experiments (instead of writing \"The problem in equation 4 can be\nsolved by any linear programming software, for which many open-source implementations exist\"), and if the author could remark on the empirical running time.\n\nAlso, I am not sure if \"Note that if L = 0, then the TV-penalization has no effect and the solution of the above procedure reduces to the empirical estimate,\" as the objective function is in L1 norm."}
