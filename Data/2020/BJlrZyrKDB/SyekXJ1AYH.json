I think the idea of the paper is quite interesting and the results are significant. \n\nIn particular, having an upper bound on the number of model evaluations to recover the region of\nimportance with high probability is significant. Moreover, they have proposed a new perturbation scheme for estimation of gradients that works better than random perturbation schemes.\n\nI have some questions listed below:\n- Can the proposed approach be integrated with different types of Saliency map methods?\n\n- Can you explain the differences of the proposed approach and the group feature formulation of https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00407 ?\n\n- Is there a quantitative way to assess the performance of the proposed approach?"}
