More specifically, the CNN architecture is employed in the ratio model and is trained by minimizing the Bregman divergence. Through experiments, the proposed approach outperformed existing outlier detection algorithms.\n\nThis paper is to make the model of (Nam & Sugiyama, 2015) deeper. The contribution of this paper is not high enough.\n\nDetailed comments:\n1. As a framework, the novelty of the paper is not high. If authors can propose an architecture that is suited for anomaly detection with density-ratio estimation, the paper can be stronger.\n\n2. The performance of the simple CNN architecture should be reported (Nam & Sugiyama, 2015). Otherwise, we cannot know whether the proposed architecture is good.\n\n3. In related work, Deep SVDD, AnoGAN are introduced. So, it is good to report Deep SVDD and AnoGAN results. Also, it is good to report the kernel based approaches."}
