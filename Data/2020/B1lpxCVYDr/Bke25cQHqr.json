The general idea behind this paper seems solid and the experimental section seems accurate and the results are good. I had a really hard time understanding exactly what it is that the authors proposed that led to the good results and what the modeling message was. There was a good bit of jargon about various architectures and why the exact model of the authors is a good idea but it was not made clear conceptually what the advantage of their approach was. I think there are good ideas in this paper but they are not distilled well.  "}
