Paper combines the insights from RW-ISTA (a re-weighted iterative algorithm with fixed parameters and LISTA, a learned iterative algorithm without re-weighting. \n\nResults show that: \n(a) On synthetic data, performance of Rw-LISTA is superior to many variants of LISTA for various SNRs\n(b) On synthetic data, Rw-LIST is better than classical approaches when SNR, Sparsity and other factors are varied. Why is LISTA not compared under all these different variations? \n(c) On MNIST, Rw-LISTA is much better than non-learned approaches, but seems very close to LISTA. \n\nIt strikes me that authors make all evaluations based on NMSE. However, motivation for CSS is that there is structure in the recovered signal \u2014 however no comparison of the recovered structure is made. While it is true, that is the signal is perfectly recovered, it would follow the structure from this data was obtained, however no such guarantees can be made for non-zero errors. \n\nI would also like to see what happens whens a pure learning based approach (such as denoting auto-encoders) is used to recover the signal. Do they perform worse than Rw-LISTA? \n\nAt present, I think the paper doesnot meet the standard of ICLR submissions. However, if authors address my concerns, I am happy to change the rating. \n\nMinor Comments:\n\u201cconsidered as unsupervised approaches since all the paramters are fixed instead of learning from data.\u201d \u2014 this is incorrect. A significant human intuition went into design of these systems. While one can argue that even NNet architecture design requires human intuition, the trend is towards using less domain-specific architectures. "}
