Which implies that when IMD is small, this does not guarantee that GW will be small. It is interesting how large can be that gap (and when typically the gap increases).\nThe term e{\u22122(t+t^\u22121)} in the definitions of GW and IMD, obviously imposes some \"scale\" for both manifolds M and N, so it is hard to call IMD multi-scale.\n\nExperiments with language affinities are not convincing to me. How is armenian and hebrew are close, or hungarian and turkish (if \"el\" is greek, then greek, hungarian and turkish are close somehow?).\n"}
