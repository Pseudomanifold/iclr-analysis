There are many recent works on this topic and the 2019 ICLR paper 'How Powerful are Graph Neural Networks?' is the closes related to this paper. In the 2019 paper connects GNN with the  Weisfeiler-Lehman graph isomorphism test in theoretical computer science. This paper makes a connection between GNN and the locality notion developed in distributed computing.\nThis connection is rather obvious and GNN being particular local algorithms, their expressive power is at least as limited as the expressive power of local algorithms. In this paper, results in distributed computing are reformulated in a GNN framework mapping the number of rounds required by a local algorithm to the depth of the GNN in order to solve a given graph problem in a worst case scenario.\nIn my opinion, this paper is rather incremental. In order to improve it, it would be nice to see experiments supporting the theoretical results in section 4. Here it is not clear at all if the bounds given are tight in practice."}
