Iterative sampling scheme naturally allows incorporating validity checks in each sampling step, assuring 100% validity in graph generation. The paper also proposes an implementation of molecule lead optimization combined with a RL framework. The experimental results show superiority in terms of valid graph generation and property optimization. \n\n\nOverall, the paper is written well. I feel no difficulty in understanding the main idea and the equations in the paper.\n \nIntroduction of the normalizing flows (Sec 3.1) can be expanded to reach non-expert users. Advantages of using invertible flows (against other generative models such as GANs and VAEs) are not described rigorously in the current manuscript. I also suggest citing a nice review for invertible flows appeared recently: \n\nIvan Kobyzev, Simon Prince, and Marcus A Brubaker, ``Normalizing Flows: Introduction and Ideas'', arXiv: 1908.09257, 2019.\n\n\nExplanations of the Sec 4.4 (+ appendix B) is simply insufficient to reproduce the experiments. More descriptions or references are required. \n\n\nExperimental results seem promising. A better validity score than the previous flow model illustrates the efficacy of the autoregressive flow against the coupling flow. \nThe performance on the property optimization (Table 3) seems brilliant. However, there is no discussion why the combination of the autoregressive flow and the RL performs greatly, compared to baselines. Some discussions will help the community to further improve the optimization tasks in the future. \n\n+ Overall, a good paper. well written, easy to understand. \n+ A new variant of the invertible-flow based graph generation model.  The novelty lies in the iterative generation process, naturally combined with the autoregressive flow. \n+ Superior to the one-shot flow baseline (GraphNVP) even if additional validity checks are omitted (Table 2)\n+ Good performances in property optimizations (Table 3, 4) \n- The explanation for RL process is simply insufficient for reproduction.\n-- No discussions about reasons why GraphAF+RL performs great in property optimization. \n"}
