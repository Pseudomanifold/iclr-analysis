In particular, it learns the embedding of paired nodes simultaneously for multiple times, and use the mean values as the final representation. The experimental result demonstrates some improvement over existing methods. Overall, the idea is presented clearly and the writing is well structured. But the novelty is limited. Specifically, \n\n1. The proposed method is very similar with the unsupervised GraphSAGE, which also optimizes Eq.(7). The  difference is that the proposed method learns a multi-channel representation and uses the attention technique to aggregate the multi-channel representation. Thus, the novelty is incremental.\n\n2. Since the proposed method uses the multi-channel representation, how to set the number of channels $K$? How does this parameter affect the performance?\n\n3. Some unsupervised network embedding baseline methods, such as DeepWalk and Node2Vec,  should be included into the experiment section. \n\n"}
