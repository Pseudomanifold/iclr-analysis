The hallucination is enabled by a CVAE, conditioned on an image of the environment, and allows the method to generalize to unseen environments. The energy cost function is trained as a contrastive loss and acts as a robustness score for connecting the two samples. The underlying graph is then used to plan for several top view planning problems.\n\nThe paper is well written and clear. I believe such latent representations are an interesting approach to solving visual navigation and general planning. HTM provides an interesting and useful extension to SPTM, allowing both generalization to unseen environments and a more robust loss function. The \n\nMy primary concern is the lack of rigorous experimentation to validate the concept and push it\u2019s limits. The results in Table 1 show HTM outperforms baselines clearly on the given problems, but how it performs on more complex problems is unclear. These problems are dynamically simple and the obstacles are easily identified. Some more difficult problems may be:\n- The mazes in SPTM or environments from https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.03801.pdf.\n- The original SPTM paper focuses on visual navigation from first person views. How does this method apply to such situations? How does the context translate to this scenario?\n- Planning in real environments with real images, as done in [6].\n\nOther comparisons and notes:\n- Can the method be applied to higher dimensional problems (dimensionality of the underlying space) where planning may be more difficult? E.g. SE(2), robot arms or other agents from UPN [26]. Application with actual 3D workspace problems too would be interesting as the image context may underspecify the environment.\n- The energy cost function acts as a proxy for connection probability when traversing an edge. This may also be useful for dynamical systems (e.g., the mujoco ant navigating a maze). Are there limitations for the method on such problems, e.g., edges may no longer be symmetric?\n- How does SPTM compare when the space has been explored already?\n- Can more quantitative results been shown such as solution path cost?\n- Provide definitions for Fidelity, feasibility, and completeness and the source of data (polling human\u2019s) in the Table 1 caption.\n- \u201cAs shown in Table 5.2, \u201c, should be renamed to Table 1.\n"}
