There are too many typos and grammatical mistakes. \nExamples include:\n -- p1: \"to learn representation of graphs\". \n -- p1: \"on other contexts its coupled with\".\n -- p1: \"NRL studies have shown a context-sensitive approach significantly outperform previous context-free SOTA methods in link-prediction task.\"\n -- p3: \"a more sophisticated neighborhood functions\".\n -- p5: \"reporeted\"\n -- p7: \"two other variant\"\n -- p8: \"and gain\"\n\n- The latter issue makes is sometimes tricky to follow the ideas presented. \nExample:\n -- last two lines in Section 3. \n\n- Last paragraph in Section 1 is pretty informative about the pros and cons of the method. It also rather admits the first issue mentioned here in the review.  \n\nMinor:\n- p4: \"Eg. \" --> eg. "}
