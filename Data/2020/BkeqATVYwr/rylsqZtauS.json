The proposed idea is mostly inspired by the attentive pooling network approach (APN) that has been widely used in the NLP domains; indeed the detailed steps of the proposed method is almost a ``mirror\u201d application of APN from question-answer pair ranking in NLP to the graph domains, and the only difference is that rather than using an RNN or LSTM to deal with the temporal orders in sentences (as in APN), the proposed method simply collect the first-order neighbors of the source node and target node and concatenate them without considering their orders. For the rest part, the authors used a hard margin loss function which is also the same as in APN.\n\nThe proposed method is very similar to the APN method and so its novelty is limited. Another concern is that although graph nodes do not have temporal orders as in word sentences, their relative connections manifested through the edges are important topological information that should be captured in contextualize a node. Unfortunately the authors almost totally ignored this information. The ignorance of the node orders appear to me not an advantage but instead a limitation, though it makes the computation and implementation much easier.\n\nThe graph attention network (GAT) is a very related method but I see no comparison with it in node clustering tasks. Also many recent methods on graph convolutional networks are not incorporated for comparison. \n\nBased on the concerns of novelty, lack of considering node topologies, and lack of comparison with strongly related methods, it is hard to recommend acceptance of this paper.\n"}
