The authors propose a new metric for measuring the simplicity of a few-shot learning benchmark and demonstrate that it is possible to achieve high performance on Omniglot and miniImageNet with their unsupervised method, resulting in a high value of this criterion, whereas the Meta-Dataset is much more difficult.\n\nThe paper is well written and generally very clear. I appreciate that the authors have highlighted the limitations of both their clustering method (that it requires more assumptions than CCNs) and their benchmark. The centroid method itself seems to draw heavily on pre-existing work, but uses a new similarity metric that improves performance beyond the current state-of-the-art on few-shot clustering tasks.\n\nThe authors acknowledge that the approximate CSCC metric they define is not consistent across architectures and hyperparameters. It is also a fairly simple metric, but nonetheless represents a novel contribution.\n\nOverall I feel that the paper introduces a well-defined problem and makes a step toward quantifying and resolving it. The experiments do a thorough job supporting the arguments of the authors.\n\n\nI have only minor issues that could help with the clarity of this paper: \n\nI wasn\u2019t sure what was meant by \u201crelabeling\u201d the query set predictions in the text below Figure 2. \n\nI would have appreciated some discussion as to why Sinkhorn distance might be expected to improve performance ."}
