This paper lacks of research motivation and solid experimental validation.\nThe authors claim \"it is the fastest domain adaptation algorithm in terms of computational complexity\", which is not very convinced.\nI cannot observe new knowledge in domain adaptation, except the Nystrom approximation technique used.\nThe equation (9) is similar to the representational based transfer model, where the T matrix is just the reconstruction matrix, because X and Z have different number of samples.\nThis paper written is a little poor, and the novelty of NBP is not clearly claimed.\nThe experimental effectiveness is weak and have no improvement compared with BT 2018 in image dataset.\nIn deep learning era, could you discuss what is the value in deep transfer learning or deep domain adapatation?"}
