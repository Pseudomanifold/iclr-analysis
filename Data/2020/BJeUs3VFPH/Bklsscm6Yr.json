The novelty seems to be too limited.\n2.\tThe proposed method NBT improves the computional efficiency of BT. The Datasets used in the experiments are not representative. More experiments should be conducted to demonstrate its efficiency on large-scale Datasets, such as VisDA and Offic-Home Dataset.\n3.\tThe precise results of CGCA are not provided, which is unfair. Besides, there is no comparsion between the proposed methods and the state-of-the-art deep learning-based methods.The experimental results seems unconvincing.\n4.\tTypos:\n(1)\t\u2018Out BT approach has no free parameter\u2026\u2019 in page 14.
