The authors examine the degree to which various factors influence systematic generalization, including 2D vs. 3D environments, egocentric vision,  active perception, and language. The experiments reveal that the first three factors, but not language, promote systematic generalization. The experiments are well-done and worthwhile, and identifying the key factors that affect generalization is a strength of the paper.\n\nI have two main criticisms. First, the model's abilities for systematic generalization are overstated. Second, critical details about the experiments are omitted that make them difficult to evaluate.\n\nLet's start with the abilities of the model. The title of the paper is \"Emergent systematic generalization in a situated agent,\" which of course implies that the agent has \"systematic generalization.\" The authors go on to say, in the abstract, that \"we demonstrate strong emergent systematic generalisation in a neural network agent\". The results, however, fall short of these statements.\n\nThe strongest results pertain to generalizing a highly-practiced action such as \"lifting\" or \"putting\" to novel objects. In this case, highly-practiced means that the actions have been trained on 31 unique objects for millions of steps. However the paper does not study whether or not the agent can learn a novel action (e.g. \"lifting\" or \"putting\" with only a few examples) and generalize it systematically to familiar objects. Nor does it study whether novel actions can be combined systematically in new ways using relations and modifiers such as \"finding the toothbrush ABOVE the hat\" or \"finding AND putting\" or \"putting to the right of.\" Benchmarks for systematic generalization such as SQOOP and SCAN include these types of generalizations, and an agent with systematic generalization should handle them as well. To be clear, I don't think it's necessary to add additional experiments to the paper, but the current results should not be overstated in their generality.\n\nEven within the reported experiments, the results suggest that systematicity is lacking in several places. In the negation task, where chance is 50% accuracy, the agent achieves only 60% correct after learning from 40 unique words and 78% performance with 100 unique words (doesn't systematic generalization imply 100%?) For the putting tasks, the agent achieves 90% correct in one experiment (section 3.2) and then only achieves 63% correct in another (section 4.2). Again, the generalization abilities seem far from systematic.\n\nCritical details about the action space and the simulation parameters are needed. The action-space has 26 actions, but the paper does not say what these actions are. These details are crucial to understanding what is required to generalize \"lift\" or \"put\" to new objects -- instead the paper only says that \"in particular the process required to lift an object does not depend on the shape of that object (only its extent, to a degree)\" and that \"shape is somewhat more important for placement\" compared to lifting.\n\nI would consider updating my evaluation if the authors make revisions to ensure that the evidence supports their conclusions. The paper's title should also be supported by the findings; to offer a suggestion, something like \"Richer environments promote systematic generalization in situated agents\".\n\nOther suggestions\n- The axis on Fig. 2 is too small to read. Also, it should be mentioned in text that the network is trained for 100 million+ steps (also, what is a step? how many episodes was it trained for?)\n- The number of objects in sets X_1 and X_2 is important and should be mentioned in the main text."}
