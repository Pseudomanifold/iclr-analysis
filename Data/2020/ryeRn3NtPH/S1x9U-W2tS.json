The idea is interesting. \n\nHowever, the proposed method is not convincing from either theorical analysis or experimental results. No theorical analysis is given on the output space adaption, which is a nontrivial adaption between a discrete probability measure and a continuous probability measure. Furthermore, the method is verified on just one pharmacogenomics case. It is not convincing that the method can be used in another application.\n"}
