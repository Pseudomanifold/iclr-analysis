In the toy datasets,  these two problems are successfully solved. In addition, the network weights can be initialized naively with the proposed method.\n\nPros:\n- The idea sounds interesting. Dead points and dead neurons are solved in the toy examples.\n- Networks can be initialized with zeros with the proposed idea.\n\nCons:\n- The experiments are not sufficient to validate the arguments.  MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets are toy datasets. As the memory complexity is reasonable, Experiments should be done on ImageNet.\n- Why aren't the constrains 12 and 13 in the final objective 16? Am I missing something?\n- Too many typos.\n\nminors:\ne hat is not defined in equation 1."}
