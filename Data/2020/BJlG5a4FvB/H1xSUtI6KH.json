The authors provide convergence guarantee and experimental evaluations demonstrating the advantage of the proposed algorithm over DPSGD and DPAdam.\n\nThe proposed method seems like a good method to have for improving the gradient-based DP learning algorithms. I have some more comments/questions:\n1. It seems to me that the experiments mainly considers high privacy (epsilon < 1) regime. This might be a bit too strict in practice. Given that Figure 5 seems to suggest that the advantage of the proposed method is less significant in the higher epsilon regime (though still pretty low to me), I think the authors might consider comment more on this matter. Maybe adding a plot showing final accuracy vs. epsilon (for epsilon going all the way up to 5 or 10) can also help.\n2. You mentioned that the accuracy of DPSGD decreases after some epoch. Can this possibly be fixed by a brief hyperparameter selection? I feel like experiments from related work don\u2019t usually have such a problem. Maybe it would look fairer if the best parameter is used for everyone. Besides, since DPSGD seems to work better in the beginning, would you consider using DPSGD first and then change to DPLSSGD or increasing sigma gradually?\n3. I\u2019m not very familiar with the field but I guess there might be other existing denoising methods for SGD or other gradient descent method. If so, why did you pick the LSSGD algorithm and do you think other denoising methods can be equally helpful for DP training? "}
