The main contributions of this paper are to explicitly learn the commonly shared and private latent factors for different data populations in a unified VAE framework, and propose a mutual information regularized inference in order to avoid the \u201cleaking\u201d induced by the shared representations across different populations. The isolation of the commonly shared and population specific latent representations learned by the proposed are empirically demonstrated on several applications. However, I have some concerns regarding this paper as follows.\n(1) It is not clear why the private representation exhibits latent features from the shared space when using equation 3 and how this phenomenon hurts this CPVAE model.\n(2) In equation 1, how to define the isotropic diagonal covariance matrix in the Gaussian distribution p? Is it parameterized by g?\n(3) In equation 3, what is the prior distribution of p(z_ki, t_ki)?\n(4) In equation (4)(5), why could the marginal KL term be canceled out when using I_q(x_k; t_k) - I_q(x_-k; \\tilde{t}_k)?\n(5) The mutual information regularized inference involved the KL term between any two private factors from different populations. It might be not efficient for optimization. Thus, it will be helpful if the authors provide the model efficiency analysis compared with other baseline methods.\n\nMinor comments:\n(1) what is the symbol \u201cn_k\u201d? Did it denote the number of examples for the k-th population?\n(2) For mutual information regularized inference, it used two different notations: \u201cI_q(x_k; t_k) - I_q(x_-k; t_k)\u201d and \u201cI_q(x^k; t^k) - I_q(x^-k; t^k)\u201d.\n"}
