Therefore, I don't think the results does not help us with better understanding of permutation invariant neural networks. \nThere \n\nUnfortunately, the paper has several typos and mistakes as well. Another non-technical issue is that apparently authors have removed the ICLR format and reduced margin to fit the paper in 10 pages which is against the spirit of page limit."}
