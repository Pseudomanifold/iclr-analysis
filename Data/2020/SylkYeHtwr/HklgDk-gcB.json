On top of the importance-weighted autoencoder (IWAE), which is only guaranteed to be asymptotically unbiased, the authors propose to use Russian Roulette estimator (RRE) to compensate the bias caused by the finite summation.\n\nThe proposed method is interesting and can be applied in many other estimators with similar properties as Eq. (6). Bias compensation using RRE is interesting, but it seems there must be many literatures that took advantage of using RRE to improve estimators. The authors have to be thorough in presenting previous research and explaining the authors\u2019 contribution that is distinguished from those.\n\nThe authors showed synthetic and real application of the estimator, but one concern is the variance. Unbiasedness with finite samples often fails because of the variance, and regularization is often useful rather than correcting bias---If unbiasedness in important, regularization definitely breaks the unbiasedness---. The only discussion about variance is a few lines in page 3 after Eq. (7), but it is unclear how the variance problem is mitigated or why the problem does not suffer high variance.\n\nIn general, this paper is well-written and dealing with important problem with interesting method. Several analysis for understanding the advantages of using the proposed method is insufficient.\n"}
