To my knowledge this is novel, however, I am failing to see the importance of this result. The paper mentions two cases as motivations: to calculate the entropy and the variance of the marginal. The  problem with these two examples is that it is unclear why these are important and they are not used in the experiments anywhere. Their use should be motivated and the performance of the distillation should be properly evaluated in the experiments.\n\nThe result regarding architecture search is interesting, but it should be expanded and explained more to be a main contribution.\n\nClarity:\n\nThe paper generally understandable, and well written, but it could be better organized. It should expand on the motivation and the architecture search, since these are key components of the paper. The figures are not legible. Even fully zoomed in, they are difficult to read.\n\nOverall assessment:\n\nThe paper has some interesting ideas, but it lacks motivation and significant results."}
