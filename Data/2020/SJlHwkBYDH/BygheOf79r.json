Empirical results on ImageNet dataset demonstrate its effectiveness. In general, the paper is clearly written and easy to follow but I still have several concerns:\n1.\tAlthough the method is easy to understand, the authors are expected to clarify why the methods can improve the transferability. The authors are expected to make more theoretical analysis.\n2.\tThe authors are expected to make more comprehensive comparisons with the recent methods in adversarial attacks, e.g, PGD, and C&W even if some methods are designed for white-box attack. \n3.\tThe authors are expected to make more evaluations on the models with defense mechanism, and numerous important methods are missing. Without this, the authors cannot claim its effectiveness since only experiments on NIPS2017 is not enough.    \n"}
