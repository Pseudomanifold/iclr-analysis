The steps for building binary network takes several components: traditional strategy to binary/optimize a model (like data augmentation,  binary initialization using 2-stage optimization, etc), real-to-binary attention matching that tries to match the output of real values and binarized model, and data-driven channel rescaling to better approximate real convolutions. All these components together makes a strong binary network.\n\nAlthough there are so many steps/tricks mentioned in the paper, I think the explanation and reason for each step is easy to understand. The outcome of the model is quite impressive-- 5% improvement over the best binary model. \n\nIt would be interesting to compare with some other compression techniques, like low-rank, sparsity, weight sharing, etc. Or it will be also interesting to see how these techniques can combine with binary model to further compress the model.\n\nAlso it would be interesting to see how the latency changes using the proposed binary model. As I can see from Table 1, which outlines the FLOPS and BOPS, to my understanding BOPS is much faster than FLOPS, so in the latency wise, the proposed model will be much faster than the original model for inference. Therefore I am looking forward to the real-timing results. "}
