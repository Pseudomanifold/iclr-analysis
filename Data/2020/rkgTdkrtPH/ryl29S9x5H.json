My main concern is that CKRL is the only baseline -- ignoring years of prior works in this space (see e.g. [1, 2]).\nFurthermore, [2] shows that two of the three datasets used by the authors suffer from test triple leakage in the training set.\n\nFinally, the considered datasets do not really test for the presence of noise - authors may want to check out e.g. https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.00279 (there are several works in this space, all of which were systematically ignored by this paper).\n\nFinally, authors claim neural link predictors were never used for denoising, but actually [3] use them to learn a prior distribution over triples in a probabilistic DB setting.\n\n\n[1] https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07297\n[2] https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.01476\n[3] https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub45634"}
