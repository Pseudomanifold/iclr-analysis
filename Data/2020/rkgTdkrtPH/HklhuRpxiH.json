Existing works only deal with each of task independently and did not investigate the benefits of coping with both tasks together. The paper is well motivated. In order to achieve them, the paper presented a GAN framework in order to train a noising KG embedding as well the generator and discriminator. The key connections between two parts are through the confidence of a noise triple and generation of the negative sample triples. The whole framework looks quite interesting and promising. The experimental results are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed model. \n\nThere are two key concerns about this paper:\n\n1) It is well known that both GAN and RL are hard to train, not to mention combining them together to joint train in order to deal with data indifferenceability issue of discrete triple generation. Are the results easy to reproduce?\n\n2) Choosing 10% triples as positive training examples seems very ad-hoc. Have you studied the sensitivity of the number of percentage of triples as positive training examples on the system performance?\n\n3) I don't know too much about the methods from knowledge graph noise detection so maybe one baseline - CKRL is enough for representing state-of-the-arts. However, for knowledge graph completion task, TransE is most simple baseline and they are rich state-of-the-art methods in this line such as [1]. It is not convincing to show the advantages of the proposed NoiGAN without such comparisons. \n\n[1]  \u201cRotatE: Knowledge Graph Embedding by Relational Rotation in Complex Space.\u201d ICLR'19. \n\n\n", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I assessed the sensibility of the derivations and theory."}
