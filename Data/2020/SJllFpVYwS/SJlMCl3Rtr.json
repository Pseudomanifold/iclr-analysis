Join image and per-pixel annotation can be a good idea however the paper needs significant improvement on literature review, model presentation and experiment result to be able to publish in ICLR. Detail comments are as following,\n\n1. On the literature review part. And not only list the GAN papers that published recently ,but show an in depth understanding of these papers. Moreover, the review the works that is relevance to the proposed idea since there exists ton of papers related to GAN.\n\n2. Model presentation part. How the loss function will be changed for this task. Formulate the problem and proposed idea mathematically. Detail explanation of the decoder part will also help.\n\n3. Experiment. Two class problem is trivial task. how will the model perform in much boarder segmentation task? How was the quality of the images generated? How were results compared with other state of art?\n"}
