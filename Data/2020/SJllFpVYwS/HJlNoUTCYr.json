The method adds an additional network to GAN-based image generator which annotates pixel masks for targeted features in generated images. Another semantic segmentation network is trained by both the original training data and many synthesized data from the proposed network.\n\nOverall, there is very few information in the main text. Especially, there is no implementation details of the additional decoder, and no explanation about features fed to the decoder. I'd say that it is hard to reproduce the results in this paper.\n\nSome experiments look unfair. E.g., the proposed method additionally uses 20 generated images with human annotations, which means that the proposed method has twice many opportunity to obtain information from human. For fair experiment, these images should also be used to train the baseline systems.\n\nSome experimental results only show its output images without any statistics and/or explanations. It is hard to grasp what is the important information of these results."}
