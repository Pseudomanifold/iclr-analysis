It relies on a novel belief state tracking approach based on a transformer architecture. The method is tested on multiWOZ dataset. \n\nThe paper is very descriptive of the architecture and doesn't motivate very well the choices that were made. I feel the authors were very much influenced by the dataset they will test their method on which led to very specific design choices. The dialog state is supposed to be representable by a set of key-value pairs which is a strong assumption. It comes from a long tradition of slot-filling applications in the field of spoken dialogue systems but I feel this choice makes the work very ad hoc. Especially, the response generator is strongly dependent on that structure. \n\nI also feel that belief tracking makes more sense in the case of a spoken dialogue system that can introduce additional ambiguity because of speech recognition errors. Here, the input text is supposed to represent quite accurately the intent of the user. It comes again from the chosen test data set. \n\nAll in all, I feel the proposed architecture would not serve the general purpose of developing end-to-end dialogue systems for multi-domain applications. It only solves the targeted task (multiWOZ). Thus, I'm not sure what is the scientific/technical contribution of the paper. I'd like the authors to comment on that. \n\n"}
