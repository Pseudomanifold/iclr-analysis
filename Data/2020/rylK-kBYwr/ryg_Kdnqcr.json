Methodologically, the innovation is to learn a slot belief tracker and a domain state tracker independently and combine them to produce a join domain-slot state tracker with \u2018late fusion\u2019 \u2014 which is then used as input to a response generator. At a conceptual level, this is largely a combination of [Wen, et al., EACL17] (for the policy network to response decoder component), [Wu, et al. ACL19] (for the intuition of the state generator modified to be a transformer network), and [Lei, et al., ACL18] (mostly on the generation side). That isn\u2019t to say that this is a \u2018smash-up\u2019 paper as putting these ideas together with a transformer network and getting it to work is a non-trivial endeavor, just that this is probably the closest contrasting work. Experiments are conducted on the MultiWoZ dataset, achieving state-of-the-art results with respect to recent competitive work on the end-to-end and state-tracking task. \n\nThe positives of this paper are readily apparent \u2014 this work combines the previously mentioned papers in an ostensibly sensible way to produce a state-of-the-art model for end-to-end (including generation) and state-tracking problems in multi-domain settings. The model is intuitively appealing and this is likely the baseline system for end-to-end multi-domain goal-oriented conversational agents going forward. From a purely technical perspective, while I believe other researchers *could* have put this together based on referenced work (i.e., it isn\u2019t a conceptual breakthrough), they did get it to work and get good results.\n\nThe weakest aspect of this paper is the presentation and writing; overall it seems rushed, took several readings (and some assumptions) to understand despite being familiar with relevant work, doesn\u2019t contrast crisply with related work, overloads some notation, and doesn\u2019t focus on possibly the most interesting aspect of the paper (in terms of seeing which subcomponents can be attributed for performance) \u2014 the ablation study. Below are more detailed/specific comments in this regard:\n\u2014 In general, when situating within relevant work, the introduction and related work sections are more of a \u2018laundry list\u2019 than direct contrast. I would even say that this should extend to the general text where works are referenced conceptually (as in the first paragraph on this review) and a clear contrast is made. \n\u2014 In the same vein, ideally, the paper should be as self-contained as possible \u2014 however, I would recommend contrasting with relevant works in the body such that readers will at least know where to reference to get a better understanding wrt concepts used in other papers and described in more detail there. Also, the introduction lacks examples to explain clearly to readers who aren\u2019t familiar with these concepts (e.g., inform vs. request slots)\n\u2014 Not just a writing criticism, but in my opinion, while the stated architecture ostensibly performs well, it really isn\u2019t clear if it is because the conceptual explanation or just a lot of machinery minimizing the loss well and many other architectures would work. Obviously, there isn\u2019t room to describe any failures, but the ablation study could capture this to some degree with additional discussion.\n\u2014 Small point; the notation \u2019S\u2019 is used both for \u2018slot\u2019 and \u2019system response\u2019. It is generally obvious which is which, but still a good idea to change.\n\u2014 In the \u2018Domain-Slot Joint State Tracking\u2019, when I see element-wise, I am thinking Hadamard. However, this looks like somewhere that a tensor-network would be appropriate to capture interactions (i.e., Kronecker product), which is also reflected in the stated dimensionality and the text. Please clarify.\n\u2014 In \u2018End-to-End\u2019 section on page 7, you \u201cadapt the method [TSCP] to the multi-domain dialogue setting\u201d. I can think of at least two ways of doing this; please clarify.\n\u2014 As this is likely the baseline for future work in this direction, Table 3 is probably the most interesting part of the paper in terms of looking where to push on this model. However, the discussion is minimal. I would prefer this over the \u2018qualitative results\u2019 and some of the repetition in the intro to related work sections.\n\nFinally, as this is very specific to dialogue agents, I do question if ICLR is the ideal venue. Nothing in the model has broader methodological implications and all of the conceptual underpinnings are somewhat specific to this domain. Based on these concerns, I am currently leaning toward \u2018weak reject\u2019 as I think the technical contribution is solid, but the presentation is weak to the point where I still have some remaining questions and don\u2019t think I will really understand what is happening in some sections until I look at the code. As the model is somewhat complicated, I understand that this is difficult to solve \u2014 but I think possible. However, I am ambivalent and would rate as borderline if available and thus am looking forward to further discussion."}
