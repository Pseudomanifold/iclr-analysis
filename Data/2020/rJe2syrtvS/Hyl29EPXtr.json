Key components:(1) learn a perturbation policy that allows the main policy to explore a wide variety of state. (2) learn a variational autoencoder to transform images to low dimensional space.\n\nExperiments in simulation on the physical robots are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of these components. Close related work is also used for comparison. The only concern I have is that the tasks considered involve robots that can automatically reset themselves pretty easily. I doubt that this will scale to unstable robots such as biped/quadruped, where once they fail, the recovering/resetting tasks will be as much or more difficult than the main locomotion tasks. But I understand this is too much to address in one paper and limitation is also briefly discussed in the final section.\n\nOverall I think this is a good paper and valuable to the community.\n"}
