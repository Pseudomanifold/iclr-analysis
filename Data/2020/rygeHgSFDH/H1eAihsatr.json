Moreover, the authors propose a new neural network architecture based on previous propositions (RealNVP and NICE) to perform this identification.\n\nThe paper's presentation is relatively clear, although all the theoretical results are relegated to the appendix. The extension to unknown latent space dimension seems to be quite straightforward, given the recent work that this paper is based on. However, the experimental results performed on EMNIST are quite convincing and the results are interesting. \nOverall, I think this paper would be interesting to the ICLR audience.\n\nIt seems currently that there is a need to choose a dimension to be large enough (i.e., larger than the true dimension of the latent space). I would have appreciated some discussion (and some experiments) if this dimension is chosen too small. \nAlso, when the dimension is chosen large enough, the non-informative learned latent variables are determined by looking at their standard deviations. Do they always have to be small compared to the informative latent variables?"}
