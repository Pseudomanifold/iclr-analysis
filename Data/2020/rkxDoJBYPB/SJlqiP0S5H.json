A computation graph is first fed into a GNN to produce a beta distribution, which is then fed into the BRKGA algorithm to yield the encoded solutions. The motivation is interesting, and the proposed method is technically reasonable. The details are also included in the appendix. To improve the quality, the following concerns may be considered:\n\n1. The detailed explanations of o_a(G) and o_s(G) should be included.\n\n2. How were the attribute vectors  x_v and x_e defined in your experiments?\n\n3. The baseline (GP+DFS) may not be strong enough, since it is designed to reduce the communication cost. With the information of the input size and time complexity of ops, a better greedy algorithm can be designed. Moreover, the performance of Local Search and BRKGA 5K are similar, and REGAL is just slightly better than BRKGA 5K. Hence, the improvement over the best efficient greedy algorithm seems small.\n\nOverall, the studied topic is interesting, and this paper is also intriguing.\n"}
