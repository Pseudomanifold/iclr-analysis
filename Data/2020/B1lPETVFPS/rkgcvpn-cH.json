The considered problem is interesting and important in the community, and the proposed method seems to be of practical use, according to the empirical results. My concern is that the contribution of the paper on the theoretical or methodological side seems a bit weak.\n\nThe proposed method relies on the VAR framework for contrastive disentanglement. The authors proposed two modifications: one is to explicit enforce the posterior of the content representation to be a Delta distribution, and the other is to make sure that the background representation has the same distribution across the background and the target. In the original VAE framework for contrastive disentanglement, the two constraints were considered in a slightly more implicit way. It is not surprising to see that the proposed method seems to outperform cVAE only slightly. To see how much we can really gain by further explicitly enforcing the two constraints, the authors may do some further studies with varied sample sizes. BTW, in the result for CelebA in Table 1, cVAE seems to outperform the proposed method, denoted by 'Ours', according to Acc of z_x, but it was indicated in the text (as well as in by the bold font) that 'Ours' performed the best--is there a typo?\n"}
