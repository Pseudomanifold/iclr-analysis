They construct a graph by connecting each SIFT feature to its 5 nearest neighbors initially. Then optimize a regression loss to find the matching between the 2d keypoints and 3d universal points. Hence applying cycle-consistency to figure out image matchings.\n\nTheir formulation of the problem as a GNN pruning is brilliant and widens the path for future research in the feature matching field. They also incorporate epipolar line constraints as a regularizer for their training. Experiments show effectiveness of adding the epipolar constraints.\n\nTheir experiments show that this is a promising approach, but probably requires further research to achieve state of the art results.  \n\nI believe this work is a valuable and novel method for pruning the sift feature matches. It is in an early but acceptable stage. Adding extra regularizers on F_v (to make it one-hot?) would be a promising first step. Also it has been shown that GNNs performance deteriorates with increased depth. There are recent developments in GNNs that alleviate the oversmoothing problem. Maybe switching to these architectures would enable this work to try 15 pass GNNs.\n\nQuestion: How do you tune the hyper-parameters? (learning rate, number of layers, etc)\n\nImprovement: In the experiment section explain the specifics of the geometric loss, how camera calibration, etc is calculated."}
