First, the authors calculate the influence score for the models with/without pretraining, and then propose some implementation details (i.e., use CG to estimate the inversed Hessian). To calculate the influence function of a model with pretraining, the authors use an approximation f(w)+||w-w*||, where w* is pretrained. \nThe experiments are conducted on MNIST and CIFAR. \n\n1.\tThe idea of converting a pre-trained model with f(w)+||w-w*|| is interesting. But I do not think the conclusion is very promising and convincing. The authors leverage Pearson correlation to measure the similarity between \u201ctrue loss difference\u201d and \u201cscore value\u201d. However, i do not think the value $0.62$ is significant. As shown in Figure (2), intuitively, the linear correlation between these two values do not hold. Also, I am not quite sure about the practical value of calculating influence scores.\n2.\tThe experiments are conduct on small-scale datasets. I am not sure whether the conclusion holds for larger dataset.\n3.\tPage 7, last paragraph, \u201cwe replace all inverse Hessians in (11) with identity matrice\u201d=>why?\n4.\tIn figure 3, what is the relationship between the two MNIST images, and the relationship between the two CIFAR images?\n"}
