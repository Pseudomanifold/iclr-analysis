The authors proposed the optimal 1-bit/2-bit/ternary quantization schemes based on minimizing the L_2 loss. The authors proposed a greedy algorithm to approximate the optimal k-bit quantization.  The authors showed through extensive experiments on real DNNs that the proposed optimal quantization (Opt in the tables) can give better generalization as compared to several state-of-the-art alternative methods.\n\nThe reviewer appreciates that this quantized DNN-paper has a theory. This theory is based on minimizing the L_2 loss between the original data and quantized data. It unifies several quantization schemes into one framework. This is in contract with technical papers in the area which propose a single quantization method. The proposed quantization can further be implemented efficiently using XNOR operations and bit-counting.\n\nThe writing is of good quality. The length is a bit larger than the recommended length of 8 pages.\n\nThe reviewer has the following concerns,\n\n- This paper motivates from rank-k quantization but implemented as a scaled quantization. At the end of page 3, the authors showed that the scaled quantization can somehow approximate the rank-k quantization. However, the approximation is loose without any guarantee. Overall, I don't understand how the low-rank quantization in section 2 is related to the proposed method and fits in the overall picture. Ideally, in section 2, the authors can have some theoretical statements to state the optimality of the rank-k quantization. Then, the authors can say that, because of practical difficulties to implement the SVD, the use the scaled binary quantization instead. Or, the authors can simply remove section 2, and add a paragraph to introduce rank-k quantization, which is in contract to the scaled quantization they used in the paper.\n\nSomewhere in the text, the authors have to explain the optimality is with respect to the L_2 loss. There can be alternative quantization based on different losses.\n\nFigure 4, could you explain why the angle trends up as the layer index increases?\n\nAfter equation(4): mention the choice of p(x)\n\nIn conclusion, analyz -> analyze, introduc->introduce"}
