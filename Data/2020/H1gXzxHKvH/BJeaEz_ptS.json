The central idea is to use a recurrent network to transform the observations into a representation that can be used with solvers specifically tailored towards that class of problems.\n\n**Decision:** I recommend to accept the paper for publication.\n\n**Arguments for decision:** The paper clearly adresses an important problem and poroposes a method capable of solving it. The method appears to be theoretically founded and the experimental validation seems solid. The relevance of the method is there as the problem class is prevalent in practical applications. The venue is a good fit as well, as the focus is the representation of a control problem in a way that allows more efficient solutions.\n\n**Feedback for improvement:**\n\n- The type setting could be improved at times. E.g. below equation (1).\n- I feel that the term \"exploration\" is overloaded. While it serves as an explicit mean to reduced the sample complexity of methods in RL, it appears to be about avoiding premature convergence in this work. I am too unfamiliar with the relevant SOC literature to judge how well the term fits, but coming from a ML background I stumbled over this expression.\n- Some of the experimental details, e.g. the exact choice of time discretisation, don't appear motivated well. \n- The paper needs to respect [1, 2] in the related work and show relations. From the perspective of learning state representations for optimal control, both works are relevant.\n- Is it necessary to start the discussion from the continuous case? While I appreciate the elegance of starting out with a continuous problem and then discretising at the last step, it felt like a barrier to understanding in my case, as my understanding of continuous optimal control is limited\u2013and I feel the audience of ICLR might have the same problem.\n\n**References:**\n\n[1] Watter, Manuel, et al. \"Embed to control: A locally linear latent dynamics model for control from raw images.\" *Advances in neural information processing systems*. 2015.\n[2] Banijamali, Ershad, et al. \"Robust locally-linear controllable embedding.\" *arXiv preprint arXiv:1710.05373*(2017)."}
