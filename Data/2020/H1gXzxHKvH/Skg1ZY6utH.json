In contrast to the prior work, this paper introduces multiplicative noise for the control and uses second order optimization. The performance is evaluated on different control tasks, e.g., linear system, cartpole, quadcopter & human arm actuated by tendons. \n\nConclusion: \nAll in all, I like the proposed research of combining theoretical approaches and deep learning to perform trajectory optimization and I would like to see much more of this research like this within the ICLR community. Furthermore, I think that the paper has a contribution and that the paper was improved compared to the initial Neurips submission (i.e., adding ILQG as baseline). However, the writeup and formatting is still very much sub-standard and must be improved to make this paper worth publishing. The current write-up is not accessible for the ICLR community and the understandability must be significantly improved (Details are provided below). Therefore, I currently rate this paper as a clear rejection but I am happy to improve the score to 7-8 if the write up is improved during the rebuttal. \n\n\nTheoretical Structure: \nI like the introduction, which covers the topic but might be a bit too long. Maybe you want to shorten the introduction and add an additional related work section at the end. The stochastic control introduction is nice and has the correct level of abstraction for the reader. However, the paper introduces many complex concepts which are not essential for understanding the paper (e.g., filtered probability space etc.). One might want to trade off understandability vs. mathematical rigor especially, if the paper does not rely on these concepts. Furthermore, you might want to make eq 1 more explicit as the multiplicative action noise is not visible from eq 1. Section 3 'A FBSDE Solution to the HJB PDE' is the most problematic section of this paper, which is not understandable for the common ICLR reader. Eq. 6, which just appears without any derivation, is not understandable and the reader has no intuition how to derive this eq. Furthermore, Eq 6 (page. 4) uses notations which is only clearly introduced later within the paper or even the appendix (e.g., Y being the propagated value function, Z being the propagated gradient of the value function is only mentioned in the appendix, i.e., page 12. \\Gamma is only introduced in page 5. Yes, Eq. 7 defines these variables but the style of definition is not standard and one does not expect the variables to be defined in this style.). Could the authors please provide an intuitive derivation of these equation and use clearer notation (Why would one want to abstract V, V_x, V_x, \\mathcal|{H}(V_x) in the first place as these are intuitive for the ICLR community and sufficiently short?) Especially, as this section highlights the difference to the prior works of Pereira et. al., this section should be very clear. Section 4 is clear but should include the loss function as the loss is not trivial and essential for the optimization. Currently, the loss description is buried in the appendix. All in all, the theoretical explanation and the bloated notation should be simplified and every equation should be embedded into an intuitive derivation. Currently these explanations are not understandable without reading the appendix and prior work.  \n\n\nExperiments:\nThe experiments apply 2FBSDE to 4 different control tasks (Linear system, quadcopter, cartpole & human arm) and compare the performance to the prior work of FBSDE and iLQG. The number of baselines and systems is sufficient. However, the paper should provide more evaluations:\n\n(1) Plot the histogram of the obtained cost distributions. \n(2) Plot a single state- and action trajectory (and the action distribution). Using these plots, the level of noise and smoothness and hence the applicability to physical systems can be evaluated. \n(3) Plot the noise free trajectories and show that these mean trajectories reach the desired solution.\n(4) Specify the exact cost function for every experiment\n\nFurther Comments to the individual experiments: \n\nCartpole:\nThe Cartpole iLQG seems to perform much better (swing-up the pendulum faster, don't deviate so much from x=0, much more coherent velocity compared to 2FBSDE, FBSDE). Could the authors please discuss these aspects in more detail and present experiments with longer time-horizons to check whether the proposed method can stabilize the cart at [0, 0, 0, 0]. The current plots don't reach this target state. Your plots also hint that the cartpole does not need to pre-swing the pendulum, which is most likely due to the very low action cost. This selection of action cost significantly simplifies the problem. Could the authors please include a cartpole with higher action cost and show that 2FBSDE can learn to pre-swing the pendulum. \n\nThe quadcopter:\nCould the authors please specify the exact quadcopter dynamics. What kind of abstraction did you model? What are the control inputs? Furthermore, the citation for the dynamics is wrong and puts the supervisor of the master thesis as first author. Furthermore, can the authors please provide longer plots to highlight, which method can stabilize the system.\n\nHuman Arm:\nFor the human arm neither iLQG or 2FBSDE reach the desired target location. Can you explain why no trajectory optimization does reach the desired position. \n\nFormatting:\nPlease rework the formatting such that the inline math does not cause the formatting issues of different line spacings (e.g., sec. 2.1, sec. 5) and irregular whitespaces (e.g., last line of paragraph 2.1 Preliminaries). Please remove the color coding of text for the experiments and make sure that the legends are sufficiently large and include all lines. Currently the legends are missing the target state. You can also extend the figure captions to highlight the conclusion of the plots. Please rework the figures such that the figures do not cause so much whitespace (e.g., Figure 3, 4 & 5). When reconfiguring the plots, you gain space, which can be used for further explanation of the theory. Furthermore, you might want add dotted lines to the confidence intervals as the confidence intervals are important but the differences are not clearly visible from the plots. Also, the labelling in figure 3 seems wrong, the axis labeled cart velocity should be pendulum angle and the pendulum angle axis should be cart velocity. All in all, the formatting can be significantly improved, which is especially bad as this paper is most likely a resubmission from Neurips.  \n\n\nMinor Comments / Questions:\n- 'where l :Rnx\u00d7Rnu\u2192R+ is the running cost and C1,23 \\phi :Rnx\u2192R+ is the terminal state cost.' Is l and \\phi of class C^{1,2} or only one of them? The notation is confusing and should be simplified.\n- Can you comment on how important this multiplicative noise in physical system? \u00ac\u00ac\u00ac\n- Why are you using a LSTM instead of a simple feed-forward neural network as the ff-nn should be sufficient to model V(x) as the value function is not recurrent. Have you tried using a simple ff-nn?"}
