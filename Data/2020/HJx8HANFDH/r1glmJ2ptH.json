Among others, the authors address the inconsistency between the train and the test stages and the problem of small batch sizes. The authors conducted an empirical ablation study of the four techniques and proposed an intuition when each method should be used.\n\nConcerns:\n(1) The comparison with baselines in section 4.2 seems to be unclear. Fig.5 shows the performance of normalization methods for different batch sizes. Batch Normalization, however, has the same performance for all batch sizes. The authors refer to this baseline as \u201cidealized Batch Normalization\u201d. Additional elaboration on what does this mean is required. \n(2) It would also be beneficial to see the comparison with the original Ghost Batch Normalization in the final evaluation (section 4.2), since this method, according to section 3.2, was capable of the significant improvement for Caltech-256 dataset.\n(3) In section 3.1, the authors provide an intuition of why can the discrepancy between test and train phases hurts the performance of a model. The empirical evaluation of this effect is needed to justify this intuition.\n\nOverall, the newly proposed method is a minor update, and novelty is limited. However, the thorough empirical study of existing improvement techniques would be a good addition to the conference.\n\nMinor comments:\n1. share the y-axis in Fig.4 between different ghost batch sizes.\n\nI would also recommend authors to include the following papers to the related work section:\n1.
