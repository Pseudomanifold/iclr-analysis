Because the proposed algorithm does not depend on the observed states, it generalizes much better, but is also much slower than RL2. On the other hand, it shares a lot of design choices with DDPG: Using TD3 and Double Q-learning, as well as using as objective function the Q-values. \nLooking at Figures 2, it is not clear that the proposed algorithm is substantially better than DDPG. \n- Cheetah, Hopper and Lunar Lander are very simple environments. Evaluation on (slightly) larger scale environments would show that the algorithm can scale. \n- The authors claim that the algorithm allows sharing of exploration strategies, which I don't believe can be the case based on it's current design.\n- Lastly, I have a question about Fig 5a vs. Fig 2b: Shouldn't the performance of MetaGenRL be the same in both? It appears to perfom much better in Figure 2b.\n\nMinor remark/question (didn't influence score):\nThe authors claim in the very first paragraph (and in the 4th paragraph) that inductive biases in humans are learned by natural evoluation through \"distilling the collective learning experiences of many learners\" by \"learning from learning experiences\". I'm not familiar with the relevant literature, but this seems like a strong statement which I believe should be supported by a citation. "}
