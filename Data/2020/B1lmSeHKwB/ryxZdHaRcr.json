In order to bridge the visual to semantic features, the authors proposed soft-labeling to compute the similarities between seen and unseen classes in attribute space.\n\nIt is interesting to use soft labeling for GZSL. The soft labeling enables the classifier to learn unseen classes through samples from seen classes.\n\nIn terms of writing, native speakers are needed to carefully proofread the submission. There are many grammar mistakes, e.g. missing articles (a/an/the). And some sentences are kinda contextually redundant.\n\nMy major concerns are as follows:\n1. In terms of the object function in Eqn. (3), why \\|W\\|_F and \\|W\\| are both used? What do you want to balance here?\n\n2. It is expected to see the influence of the soft labeling. To show that, analysis on \\alpha, which balances the hard and soft labelings, is needed.\n\n3. It's not clear how many training/test images are there from each dataset. Also, how to tune the hyper-parameters, \\lambda and \\gamma, was not mentioned.\n\n4. The experimental results are not consistently better than baselines on all the datasets/settings. For some settings, the performance of the proposed SZSL is quite worse than a few others."}
