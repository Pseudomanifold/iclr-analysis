The authors show really interesting results where they are able to retrieve a small subset of encoded images (mnist) by giving the autoencoder random noise. They also show they can retrieve full videos by giving the autoencoder the output frame from the previous timestep.\n\nThe overall problem is a really interesting one which is to try to develop associative memory, retrieval models. \n\nDecision:\nReject\n\nReasons:\n1. Although the work is interesting, the only related work the authors cover is hopfield networks. A cursory search indicates that this has been done before (k. Niki IEEE, Trischler 2016, M.A.Kramer 1992).\n\nImprovement:\n1. A more thorough discussion of related work would be helpful.\n2. A direct qualitative comparison to related work would also be helpful."}
