To this end, the authors prove a series of theoretical results and establish limitations of these architectures for learning from point clouds. \n\nUnfortunately, due to a delay with my review, I cannot afford the joy of carefully examining the proofs. \n\nI do not find significant practical value in the obtained results. While the theorems proved in the paper are original and novel, they are a refinement of the already known results regarding approximation theorems for PointNet and DeepSets, respectively, hence only a marginal improvement in understanding these function classes.
