Some theoretical analyses are also provided to backup the empirical observation. \n\nThis paper is very well-written. The methods are explained very clearly, and the logic is easy to follow. However I think this paper also has some weak points, as listed below:\n\n(1) The frequency principle lacks a rigorous definition. In Section 2, the authors provide very inspiring explanations and examples, however no rigorous definitions are given. Is there a way to directly quantitatively define the response frequency?\n\n(2) In Section 3.1, it is not explained why the frequencies are calculated based on the samples. Probably I have missed something, but based on the description, can\u2019t the frequencies be directly calculated on a grid along the 1-dimensional subspace defined by the mean and first principle component of the data? In other words, even after training the predictor function with real data samples for several steps, the frequency of a predictor function should still be its own property and  should be independent of the distribution of data inputs. In fact, are the vectors $n^{-1/2} (cos( 2\\pi k x_{p_1,1}), cos( 2\\pi k x_{p_1,2}), \\ldots, cos( 2\\pi k x_{p_1,n}) )$ for different $k$ even orthonormal vectors? I think unless $x_{p_1,i}$ follows certain specific distributions, these vectors are not even close to orthonormal. Therefore using them to calculate the frequencies is very weird.\n\n(3) In fact, are Sections 3,4 and 6 studying the same kind of frequency? It is not very clear due to the vague definitions.\n\nBecause of these concerns, I think this paper is on the borderline. For now I tend to recommend a weak reject.\n"}
