The authors claim that the irrationality can actually help to identify  the reward function, making the problem better defined. \n\nHowever, such a phenomenon is not really very surprising to me. The authors take the type of irrationality of the agent as something pre-specified in the model, which actually acts like some prior knowledge information. In other words, the author is rally posing more assumptions to the model, and to get a well-defined model. \n\nIt would be very interesting if the authors can actually identify the type of irrationality, or can deal with all the types of irrationality together in one model. At the moment, regarding the submission, I tend to reject the submission.  "}
