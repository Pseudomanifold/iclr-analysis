The central premise for the method of characterizing relative importance of information represented by the network is based on an information theoretic measure. A variety of results are presented to examine the impact of keeping or removing information deemed important by this measure and a comparison is made to existing approaches as a justification for the proposed methods.\nI find that the proposed method appears to be theoretically sound and is interesting in revealing differences to other information theoretic methods especially in the early layers. The relative similarity in later layers is also an interesting observation and one that is relatively hard to characterize. \nPerhaps the strongest case for the proposed method comes from the keep accuracy subject to SMOE scale. The removal accuracy is a bit less convincing but appears to be a fair and honest evaluation. Moreover, the LOVI scheme for visualization is interesting in itself and I found this aspect of the work to be thought provoking with respect to how such methods are examined from a qualitative perspective."}
