The idea is interesting. \n\nHowever, the technique details, the experimental results and the analysis are not as attractive as the idea. The proposed method is a simple combination of existing works without any creative improvement. Furthermore, comparing with the MTL baseline, the experimental performance of proposed method does not get obvious improvement while the computation cost increasing significantly.  Besides, there is not enough analysis about the idea this paper proposed. The intuition that more similar tasks share more parameters probably cannot always ensure the improvement of MTL.\n"}
