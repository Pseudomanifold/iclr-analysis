The authors localized a phenomenon  and demonstrated how to exploit it. I trust the results because I performed exactly the same experiments for CIFAR-10 with longer non-regularization periods and found that there is no effect (this is also that the authors show in the paper)  but I didn't test on other datasets and obviously didn't think about potential benefits for compression. \nSince model compression is not my field, I would just make a general suggestion to include and compare to state-of-the-art techniques.
