The motivation is clear and easy to follow. The simulation experiment with the symbolic dataset gives impressive results. \n\nI like this idea and have one concern about the experiment. To be specific, all the reported results are obtained in the symbolic dataset to simulate the real-world case. Have you performed the entity alignment in the real-world data, such as the cross-lingual knowledge graphs, or cross-modal analysis? It's expected to experiment with more challenging datasets. By the way, have you released your code? This is important to an ICLR submission. \n"}
