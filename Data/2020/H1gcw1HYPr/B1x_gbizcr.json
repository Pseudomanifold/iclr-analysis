The model assumes that the location of the objects is given and the only task to perform is the correct association of instances. Results shows that the proposed approach is better than hand-crafted features on different simulated tasks. Additionally the propose model is shown to help to reduce the computational cost for question answering task.\n\nI lean to reject this paper because in my opinion the proposed method is just a set of predefined rules to train a network to be able to perform object association between a new time step and a memory. Additionally the experimental evaluation is very weak in several points (see below). \n\n- Contribution: this approach proposes a set of rules to train a network to be able to learn the correct association  between two set of features. Additionally, the network is used together with a memory to keep track of previously seen objects. In my understanding the proposed work presents a set of hard-coded rules to train a network for tracking. However, the connection with tracking is presented only in related works (at the end of the paper) and no comparison with other tracking approach is presented. Additionally, the network model that is actually used for the experiments (graph network) is not presented in the main paper, which makes more difficult to understand how the network works for the given task.\n\n- Experimental evaluation: Experiments are performed on a very simple, simulated environment. Objects are very simple to recognize and their location (which is often  a difficult component of the problem) is given. As the task is quite straight forward, the model obtains almost 100% on all tests. Comparisons are made only with hand-crafted features. It is quite evident that a learned similarity measure will be better than hand-crafted distances. \n\nAuthors should explain more clearly that the proposed contribution is a set of rules used to learn a distance between features in order to associate object instances. \nA cleared connection with tracking should be provided from the introduction. In the evaluation there should be a comparison on multiple and more challenging tracking datasets. In this way we can compare the proposed training technique with other tracking approaches that also learn to a distance in order to associate object at different time steps. \n\n"}
