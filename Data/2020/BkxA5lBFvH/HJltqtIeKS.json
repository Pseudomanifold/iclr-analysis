It draws intuition from human behavior. The proposed method (risk-averse domain adaptation (RADA)) learns probabilistic model-based RL agents from source domains, and uses them to select actions that has the best worst-case performance in the target domain.\n\nThe paper mentions safety-critical applications like auto-driving. However, generally, I don't think black-box models are suitable for these safety-critical applications."}
