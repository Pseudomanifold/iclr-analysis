JAX MD provides automatic derivations and allows to easily incorporate machine learning models in the MD workflow.\n\nThe paper is clearly written and seems technically correct. However, given that I am a specialist of neither package implementation nor physics, I can not really asses that all the details are correct/useful.\n\nFurthermore, even if this work will surely be of great use for the physics community, I am not not sure that the contribution of this paper is sufficient for ICLR.
