It particularly looks at how closely the sample-based approximation of the objective's gradient aligns with the true gradient of the objective, how accurately learned values match the true expected returns, and how well the optimization landscapes of surrogate objectives line up with the objective of maximizing the return.\n\nI propose accepting this paper, as it reveals a key gap in our understanding of why policy gradient methods work. Such emphasis can suggest why deep RL results tend to be inconsistent and irreplicable, and spark future work on closing the gap between theory and practice. Further, the paper is overall well written.\n\nI primarily would like clarification on the optimization landscape visualizations:\n\n1) Is the step direction the direction of the update actually performed at that time step?\n\n2) Would moving diagonally in this space correspond to a mixture of following the update direction and a normally-distributed random direction? Concretely, in the true reward plot at Step 0 for few state-action pairs in Figure 8, does this suggest that mixing a random direction with the update direction would be better than moving cmopletely in the step direction?\n\nMinor:\nTypo in citation \"...policy improvement theorem of Kakade and Langford Kakade & Langford (2002)\""}
