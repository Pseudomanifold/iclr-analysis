In particular, the method augments the state using the solution of an ODE. Experiments on Lorenze-64 dynamics and sea level anomaly demonstrate the advantage of the proposed method over state-of-the-art baselines.\n\n+ The unification of Taken\u2019s embedding theorem and deep learning provides a novel perspective into dynamical systems\n+ Impressive experiment results compared with baselines including RNN and latent ODE\n\n- The proposed method requires knowledge of the underlying dynamic model to solve the ODE, which is not fair for other methods\n- The model is trained using data from the same initial conditions, which is essentially overfitting. The authors should provide experiments for dataset from different initial conditions.\n- The writing is not very clear. For example, how to solve the optimization problem in Eqn (7),  as the augmented states u_{t-1} are unknown? How to find the bijective mapping M for general dynamical systems?\n\nMinor: question mark in section 4 page 6.   Figures 2 plots are difficult to read, pls provide more details in columns and rows."}
