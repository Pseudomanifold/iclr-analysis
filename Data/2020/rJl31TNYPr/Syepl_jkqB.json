The paper is well-motivated and illustrates the importance of the problem.\n\nAccording to my knowledge, this is the first paper to study the complete visual perception pipeline in autonomous driving. Previous work along this line focuses on attacking the object detection task, however, this work considers object tracking, which is essential for a safety-critical system as temporarily failure of object detection for one frame usually won\u2019t hurt the decision. Thus, it is an important step towards a more realistic attack on the visual perception pipeline in autonomous driving.\n\nThe paper also presents a thorough background of MOT. Their proposed algorithm works much better than other alternatives.\n\nWeakness:\nI wish the evaluation can be conducted a bit more broadly. Currently, it is only evaluated 20 clips from one dataset.\n\nMinor points\nIn Eqn (1), \\lambda and \\gamma are not defined. \nPage 5 last line, \u201cassociate\u201d should be \u201cassociated\u201d.\n"}
