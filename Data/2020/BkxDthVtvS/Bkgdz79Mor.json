However, the actual construction looks equivalent to steerable neural nets to me (see the papers by Cohen and Welling). The generalization of steerable nets has been published under the name \"gauge equivariant neural nets\", it would be very interesting to chart out the exact connections between these concepts. \n\nThe authors mention that Z^{\\times G} is not the only possible lifting space. I believe that the general case would be Z^V where V is a representation of G. \n\nMany of the earlier papers on equivariant nets were written in the language of representation theory. It is interesting that similar nets can be constructed by purely group theoretic methods, but I really think that ultimately they are same thing. Consequently, I would expect all the experimental results to be identical.\n\nWhat would make this paper really valuable for didactic purposes is if these connections were carefully mapped out and presented with intuitive diagrams and examples.", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I carefully checked the derivations and theory."}
