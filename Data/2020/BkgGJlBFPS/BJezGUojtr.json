The method learns a coarsening sequence of graphs together with the corresponding node representations. The coarsening sequence is learned using the method in Loukas (2019). The node representations are learned using an encoder-decoder structure, where the encoder encodes a graph to coarsened node representations, and the decoder decodes the node representations to a coarsened graph. The adopted objective function is analogous to VAE, except that the decoder does not aims to reconstruct an identical graph. Experiments on graph classification is performed on 5 different datasets, and competitive accuracy is achieved.\n\nConcerns: The authors claim that the leant representation in an unsupervised manner is more desirable in terms of generalization. However, they only provide very limited experimental results, which is not very convincing. Moreover, the authors also do not explain clearly on when the node representation of the coarsening sequence is needed."}
