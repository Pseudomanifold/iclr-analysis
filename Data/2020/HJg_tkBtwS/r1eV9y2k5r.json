The proposed method is model agnostic. Quoting the authors, they advocate for methods that look at interpretability \u201cas understanding the population distribution through the lens of the model\u201d without restriction on the models fit. The problem is posed as a hypothesis testing problem. The paper proposes \u201cproper test statistics\u201d for model agnostic feature selection. It is argued that f-divergence tests are proper statistic tests, with the KL being particularly interesting as it provides computational advantages. \n\nI have found the paper interesting. The topic is relevant and the approach is interesting. However, I have two main reservations for this work. First, I have found the method difficult to follow and sometimes unclear. Important results are only explained in the appendix. For instance, the derivation of Equation 5 is important but only shown in the appendix. Furthermore, that derivation in the appendix needs to be clarified in my view. For instance, on page 15, for the derivation of $\\delta_I$, can you explain how you went from the second equality to the third equality where references to \\tilde{x}_j are removed from one line to another? It could be due to your definition for the term with a conditional independence\twith the outcome assumed but I suggest that you clarify this as it is important for the paper and for the use of the KL. Also, in this equation, should it be $q(x_j|x_{-j}) instead of $q(x_j,x_{-j})$?\n\nThe second issue that I have is with the experiments. Any reason why the key results on the interpretability of the approach are mostly shown in the appendix (e.g., table 4,5,6)?  Why does table 6 not show results for all the baselines? For the hospital readmission use case, were you able to also get percentages of important features and have it compared with the baselines and vetted for clinical significance? This is more minor but worth double checking in my opinion. For this experiment on re-admission, the paper claims to have data from 130 hospitals for 10 years. Yet the n numbers seems pretty small to me. Total number of events < 100 000 for 130 institutions over 10 years. That would mean that we are dealing with less than an average of 80 admissions per institutions per year. Please confirm or explain if any filtering was done beyond what is described in appendix I. "}
