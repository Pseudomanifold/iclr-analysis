They propose an extension to a one-class based approach that can do anomaly detection in an unsupervised fashion.\n\nThe main contribution is a modification of the target function for the training of one-class NN. The experiments are not convincing and the modification doesn't seem to provide much inside into representation learning and anomaly detection area. \n\n1. Figure 3: no axis labels\n2. ROC AUC is not the best quality to measure the quality of imbalanced classification problems or anomaly detection, PR AUC (average precision) is better\n3. In Table 2 and other experiments, there is a comparison to only one existed method e.g. authors don't reproduce results for OC-NN\n4. Table 1: why compare a supervised method to an unsupervised one and don't compare to other methods?\n"}
