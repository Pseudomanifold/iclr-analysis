The authors propose a new model txt2\u03c0, based on a new layer called FiLM\u00b2, which combines text and visual features in a way that allows visual features to be encoded with knowledge of the text features (as in the FiLM layer from previous work), as well as text to be encoded with knowledge of the visual features. The model is trained to play the game using IMPALA.  Ablation studies show that the FiLM\u00b2 layer leads to a substantial improvement, and also shows the necessity of curriculum learning.  Performance is still below human performance suggesting this is a promising area for future work.\n\nThe work here is complicated, but the writing and explanations are very clear. A new problem domain is introduced, which I think will be interesting to many other researchers.  I am not an expert in this area, so it's hard for me to give a confident assessment of the significance of this paper, so I give this paper a Weak Accept, despite enjoying the paper and having no specific points of criticism."}
