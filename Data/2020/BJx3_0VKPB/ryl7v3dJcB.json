Please include \n\n(1) a more detailed description of data input and output for system (i.e. where are gendered bits coming from), and more details of the memory (is it a global fixed memory? then how gendered bits assigned?)\n\n(2) a more complete definition of bias amplification -- beyond just an example (i.e. what training representation are you comparing to?). A formula would be useful here.\n\n(3) more complete experimental definition. What datasets exactly are you evaluating on?\n\n(4) overview sections to motivate your solutions and your setup (i.e. an introduction, related work)"}
