I am inclined to reject this paper. \n\nSupporting argument:\n1. The authors use quite small dataset (also non-standard) for evaluation. It might be better to evaluate on some standard large-scale language model datasets. \n2. As mentioned in  Section 5.5, the proposed approach is not generalized to other countries. \n3. Since the task is language generation, the use of bias-amplification in embedding space is not well justified. \n4. What are the words used in the Fair Region?\n5. In section 3, the V, G of memory are not used. What's the output of FairRegion function?\n\nAdditional feedback:\n1. The usage of notation, citation is quite poor. \n- The usage of \\citep and \\cite are different.\n- In Table 1, what are PERU-MEXICO, MEXICO-PERU models?\n- Section2 -> Section 2"}
