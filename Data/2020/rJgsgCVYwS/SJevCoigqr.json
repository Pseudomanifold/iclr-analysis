Specifically three point processing blocks are presented that enables wider and deeper architectures with improved information sharing. The approach is thoroughly evaluated on point segmentation benchmarks. \n\nThe paper is very well written and a pleasure to read, even for a reader unfamiliar with point networks.  The proposed blocks are clearly and intuitively presented and their impact convincingly demonstrated. \n\nFor the sake completeness, it would be important to include memory usage and inference time in Table 2, especially as it deals with comparison against Deep CGN, so one can better assess the advantages/disadvantages of both approaches. Timing results would also be important to include in Table 3.\n\nOverall, it is a very interesting problem and the proposed approach could have broad applicability."}
