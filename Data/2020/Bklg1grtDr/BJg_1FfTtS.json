The problem is formulated into an optimization task within the simplex where the total allocation is fixed at w. Then the authors proposed simulation methods to solve this problem and use experiments to demonstrate the method's advantages. The paper is sound an clear, but it's not clear to me which part is novel and which part is from existing work, hence I doubt the contribution level of this paper. Furthermore, I'm not quite sure whether the topic fits ICLR as it's more related to game theoretic society and not related to representation learning."}
