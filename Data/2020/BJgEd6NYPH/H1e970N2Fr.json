This approach is motivated by the adaptive gradient methods and classical trust region methods. The idea of the design is reasonable, but the theoretical and empirical results are not strong. I can not support acceptance for current version.\n\nMajor comments:\n\n1. Section 4.2 says \u201cAlgorithm 1 with A_rms ellipsoids converges with the classical rate O(\\epsilon^{-2}, \\epsilon^{-3}) thanks to Proposition 2 above and Theorem 6.6.8 in Conn et al.  (2000).\u201d I have two questions about this statement.\n\na) What is (\\epsilon^{-2}, \\epsilon^{-3})? Some subscript or min/max notation looks missing.\n\nb) I have checked Theorem 6.6.8 in Conn et al. (2000). It only shows the limit point of the sequence of iterates is a second order critical point. How to obtain the convergence rate of Algorithm 1 seems not directly. I hope the authors provide detailed derivation and present Theorem 6.6.8 here (Maybe the version of the book I have seen is not identical to yours).\n\n2. Is there any stop criterion of the sub-problem solver? How the precision of the sub-problem affects the global convergence rate?\n\n3. The experimental section only reports \u201clog-loss\u201d, which is not enough to deep learning applications. It would be interesting to validate weather the proposed method achieves lower test error than baselines.\n\n\nMinor comments:\n\n1. The values of kappa in the second and the third sub-figures of Figure 1 should be different.\n\n2. The box of Proposition 3 is spited into page 14 and 15.\n\n3. Equation (37) is too long and does not fit within the margins.\n\n"}
