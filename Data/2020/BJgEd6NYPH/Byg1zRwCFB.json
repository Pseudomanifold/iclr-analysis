I believe that the authors were careful in phrasing their contribution and provided some supporting material but the wall-clock time results on resnets are too bad to envision any practical application (\"advances in hardware will be needed\"). It would not be a problem if the paper were the first to deal with second-order methods. However, the niche of second-order methods attempting to beat first order methods is not empty and one of the main exit plans consists in showing better wall-clock time convergence, something which is  obviously very hard.\n\nMinor notes:\nbackprogations -> backpropagations"}
