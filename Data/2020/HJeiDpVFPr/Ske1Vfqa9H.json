The authors provide a combination of theoretical and experimental results in support of the use of several neural architectures to learn such distances. In particular, the develop \u201cdeep norms\u201d and \u201cwide norms\u201d, based either on a deep or shallow neural network. Metrics are elaborated based on norms by combining them with a learnt embedding function mapping the input space de R^n. Theoretical results are mostly application textbook results and intuitive, the overall work forms a coherent line of research bridging theory and applications that sets well justified reference approaches for this topic."}
