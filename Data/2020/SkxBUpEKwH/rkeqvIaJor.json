The character is then redrawn into the background with a neural net, and all of this is done in real time.\n\nAll in all, this paper was well structured and extensively detailed wrt how it engineered this solution (and why). If I had a complaint, it would be that I did not learn anything scientifically from the paper. There isn't a tested hypothesis, but rather it's a feat of engineering to get this to work. Those are important as well for the field, and I suspect that this direction could be pushed a lot more. For example, it's not close to getting realistic spatial movement relative to the plane nor is the control that impressive wrt limbs. However, as a next-contribution, this work deserves to be seen more widely.\n\nHence, I rate it as a weak accept.", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "N/A"}
