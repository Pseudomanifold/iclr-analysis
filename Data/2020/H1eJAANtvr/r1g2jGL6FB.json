The proposed model, CGT, has an encoder-decoder structure, and is characterized by clustering modules for spacial regions based on their temporal patterns. To handle temporal unsmoothness, additivity-preserved multi-view position encoding was proposed to characterize different temporal relationships. The experimental results on real ride-hailing datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method to some extent.\n\nThe major concern is the presentation of this paper. There are many unclear points by going through the current paper, which prevents full judgement of the merits of the proposed method. First, the key problem to address is claimed to be the spacial and temporal unsmoothness. From the introduction, it is hard to see how important the problem is. It is better to use real data statistics to show the prevalence and concrete examples of such unsmoothness. Second, the technical sections presents the methods with few intuition on how does each component solve the unsmoothness problem. Figures such as fig 2 and 4 are very dense with few annotations, neither in captions nor main texts, thus are hard to understand. Finally, in the experiments, it is good to see some results for model interpretation. However, it is not clear on how to measure the spatial and temporal unsmoothness in fig 6 on the x axis.\n"}
