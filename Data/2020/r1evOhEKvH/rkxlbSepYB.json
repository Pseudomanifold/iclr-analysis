The input graph is given with only some labeled, and the goal is to label the rest. The architecture is trained on a validation set to learn features that optimize the accuracy of inference on the unlabeled node.\n\nAll parts of the architecture seem reasonable, and the experiments report advantage over prior work, which counts in favor of the paper. I found the writing to be somewhat dense and lack in clarity. My main concern is that I was unable to find a comparison of the techniques to prior work and an explanation of novelty. Unfortunately I am not very familiar with prior work on using neural networks for graph-based semi-supervised learning, and the lack of discussion made it difficult to put this work in context and assess its contribution. As of now I set my score to a weak reject, though I am willing to raise it if the positioning against prior work is explained and points to a substantial contribution.\n\nA remark on clarity: it would help to use the appropriate commands for citations (citet and citep). The constant interruption of unbracketed references burdens the flow and readability of the text."}
