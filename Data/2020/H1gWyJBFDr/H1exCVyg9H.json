Its motivation comes from using stride(>1) convolution to replace pooling in CNN. The authors claim that the computation and memory can be reduced with the proposed bipartite graph convolution, because the pooling layers are removed. The authors also conduct experiments about graph skip connection and graph encoder-decoder to show that their method's flexibility.\n\nCons:\n1. If I understand it correctly, the bipartite graph convolution still needs a cluster algorithm to determine the output graph, which is identical to cluster-based pooling methods like DiffPool. In addition, previous pooling methods like DiffPool, gPool are NOT non-parametric as suggested by Figure 1. Therefore, the advantage of the proposed method is vague.\n2. The idea of bipartite graph convolution seems different from that of stride convolution. The connection should be better explained.\n3. The experiments of this paper are not very convincing. Comparison with more baselines and ablation study are needed to demonstrate the effectiveness of this method. On graph classification tasks, many other methods (GCN with pooling) are worth comparing with, like DiffPool, SAGPool, gPool, etc. More datasets should be included. In addition, it will be more convincing to do ablation study, e.g. single layer replacement."}
