The authors claim that state-of-the-art Siamese trackers mostly rely on saliency detection in the center of the search window while ignoring the target instance representation and propose an additional object detection branch during training to mitigate this effect.\n\nStrengths:\n+ Analysis how perturbation target and search image influence tracking performance\n+ Demonstrates that including detection objective during training improves performance\n\nWeaknesses:\n- Makes claims about Siamese trackers in general but only experiments with authors\u2019 architecture\n- Analyses in Figs. 6\u20138 not very helpful/conclusive\n- No test case where capturing appearance is important for tracking and authors\u2019 approach helps\n- No comparison of tracker trained without detection objective on real vs. random targets\n\nThe paper is well motivated and has a clear hypothesis. However, its execution unfortunately leaves a lot of room for improvement and getting it into acceptable shape would require a major revision. Some details on my main criticisms:\n\nClaim is way too general. The authors state that Siamese trackers in general suffer from the center bias problem. However, the authors do not analyze any other trackers than their own one. I understand that training a state-of-the-art tracker with the additional object detection branch could possibly require resources beyond what\u2019s available to the authors. However, it\u2019s not clear to me why the authors do not use the pre-trained version of at least one or two existing trackers to demonstrate their shortcomings (like Fig. 4)\n\nAnalyses in Fig. 6\u20138 are not very helpful. The only real effect the detector shows in Figs. 6\u20138 is a tiny improvement in IoU in Fig. 8 \u2013 otherwise the analyses neither support the claim nor do they reveal why detection as an additional objective actually helps. To establish that there is a center bias and trackers ignore the appearance term, the following two analyses could be done:\n\n- Identify a set of test cases where capturing appearance is important (e.g. temporary occlusion) and demonstrate that your approach improves performance on these cases.\n\n- For the table in Fig. 5, also show how a conventional tracker (i.e without object detection branch) performs on random targets. If the hypothesis is correct that the object detection objective during training reduces center bias and increases reliance on appearance, then a conventional tracker should show a smaller reduction due to random targets than your improved tracker does. The same quantitative analysis could also be done for existing state-of-the-art trackers, as it does not require training. \n \nMinor Comments:\n- Caption of Fig. 4: is instead of if?\n- Figure 5\n\t- y-axis label: lower is better despite \u201crobustness\u201d suggesting the opposite\n- Why do the numbers in the figure not match those in the table?\n- What is the center bias baseline, i.e. what is the performance if center of search image is predicted without any network?\n"}
