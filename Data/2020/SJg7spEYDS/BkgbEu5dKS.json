More specifically, the squared-loss between the true ratio function and the model  (a.k.a., Pearson divergence) is employed to train model. Through experiments, authors demonstrate that the proposed density-ratio based approach compares favorably with existing algorithm.\n\nExperimentally, the proposed model performs pretty nicely. However, the derivation is not certain and some important density-ratio based GAN is missing.\n\nDetailed comments:\n1. Some important density-ratio based GAN methods are missing. For instance,\u2028https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02920\u2028https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.03483\n2. Some derivation of density-ratio estimation is not clear. To the best of my knowledge, the ratio model is obtained by minimizing the distance between true ratio function and its ratio model (Something similar to (4)). But, in this paper, the authors describe the ratio is obtained by using MMD density ratio estimator. Could you explain the derivation in detail?  \n3. I guess, (8) is derived in similar way of  http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume10/kanamori09a/kanamori09a.pdf In this case, (8) is not correct.\n4. The ratio is defined by using kernel. Thus, I guess the kernel model is employed. However, this information is missing. "}
