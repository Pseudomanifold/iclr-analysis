The paper is motivated by the finding that several existing works on adversarial patch defenses are easily \"breakable\" by in the white-box setting. The idea of the proposed method is derived Interval Bound Propagation (IBP), which is originally proposed for certified defense against adversarial noise. To simplify the certificate training in the patch defense setting (which original scales quadratically with respect to the image size), two randomized training methods are proposed. Lastly, experimental results indeed verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\nThe paper is well-written and very well-organized. It is interesting to see supposedly strong adversarial patch defense methods \"break down\" in a very simple setting. And the contribution of the paper is significant to the field.\n\nI do have a question with regard to the randomized training method:\nAlthough random patches (or selected worse-case patches at random location) can be used for certificate training, in order to create a certificate during testing, does it mean that you do have to conduct many forward pass of the network with respect to all patches at all locations?"}
