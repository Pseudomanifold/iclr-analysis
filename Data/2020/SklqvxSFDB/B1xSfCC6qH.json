A training dataset is aggregated, collecting errors of the considered VO system (libviso2) as observations and the images for the respective time steps as conditional inputs. A convolutional neural network is then trained to amortize a predictive multivariate Normal distribution that should fit the observed errors. The inputs to the network are the images at the current time step. The network parameters are optimized with stochastic gradient descent, maximizing the log-likelihood of the observed error w.r.t. the predicted Gaussian model. The authors also propose modifications to an existing convolutional neural network architecture. The method is evaluated on the KITTI and EuroC data sets.\n\nThe reviewer recommends rejecting the paper. In its current state it is not possible to judge the contributions due to a lack of clarity in the experiments section and because a highly relevant metric is omitted (long-term translation and rotation error). The results on uncertainty quantification are hard to judge.\n\nMajor Comments:\n\n1) The method described in the paper is justified.\n\n2) Section 3 fails to point out the exact differences to the cited prior work. For example, the assumed LDL decomposition appears the same as in the work  by Lie et al. 2018. It should be stated more clearly what the delta is to the work of Peretroukhin & Kelly 2018 that lets the CNN predict the Normal mean, and to the work of Lie et al. 2018 that has the CNN predict the Normal covariance matrix. After looking at the respective papers, it appears the two methods have been combined in a single consistent Gaussian model without further modification.\n\n3) The summarized statistics in Table 2 are not clear. Are those the predicted statistics from the amortized conditional distribution? Or are they the empirical diagonal Gaussian statistics computed over the VO transformations which have been corrected by the mean predicted by the network? The latter is my current best guess given the highlighting. However it is not clear what this metric would show us in terms of model performance.\n\n4) Quantifying the quality of the residual uncertainty estimates via the ratio of observed residuals that fall into the +/- 3 sigma band of a diagonal Gaussian seems like an arbitrary choice. The neural network is supposed to predict a full multivariate Gaussian distribution - why not utilize the full covariance matrix? For example, one could compute log-likelihood scores w.r.t. the predictive model. The authors of DICE evaluate their uncertainty estimates by illustrating a correlation between uncertainty and error magnitude. A similar experiment would be helpful here to judge the quality of the uncertainties.\n\n5) The last sentence right before the conclusion is unclear. What is meant under \"the results from considering an unbiased error\"\u2014was a second model that assumes a zero-mean Gaussian fit to the data, similar to DICE?\n\n6) The paper is missing evaluations that demonstrate the overall and piece-wise reduction of drift in the visual odometry system when the predicted corrections are applied. The last two figures showing a single example from KITTI are not sufficient to judge the effectiveness of the method. For instance DPC-net, which the authors compare against, reports three metrics of long-term pose error (See: C. Evaluation Metrics of https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.03128.pdf). It is not possible to evaluate the contribution of the method without looking at long-term trajectory estimates and how they change after applying the proposed model.\n\nSuggested improvements:\n\n1) The paper needs an experiment detailing long-term pose error with and without the proposed method.\n2) It is hard to interpret section 4.2.3. The paper would benefit from an experiment showcasing the usefulness of uncertainty."}
