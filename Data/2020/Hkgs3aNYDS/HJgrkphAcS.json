Also, I think it is not appropriate for ICLR since it assumes knowledge of quantum computing that most people at this conference would not have, and I as a reviewer do not possess, and hence cannot evaluate this paper. For example, I do not know bra-ket notation.\n\nIf the ACs disagree, I am happy to revise my review for this paper and try to be more thorough."}
