The uncertainty is then used to define an intrinsic reward function. The paper has sufficient technical depth. However, I am disappointed by the comparison to prior work.\n\nStrengths\nInteresting non-parametric approach to estimating uncertainty in the agent's forward dynamics model\nClearly written paper with sufficient technical depth\nWell structured discussion of related work\n\nWeaknesses\nMy main problem with the paper is a missing fair comparison to prior work. The two main contenders are MAX by Shyam et al 2019 and the Disagreement approach by Pathak et al 2019. Comparing the results on AntMaze presented here with those in Shyam I see that MAX only gets to high 80s in terms of maze exploration rate, while in their paper it is in the 90s. In comparison to Pathak, as far as I understand, a different robotic manipulation task was used (HandManipulateBlock here in comparison to the grasp and push objects on a table task by Pathak). Moreover, there are no experiments comparing the proposed approach to the stochastic Atari environments investigated in Pathak et al 2019. I understand this would require dealing with discrete action spaces, but I don't see why this would be infeasible. Overall, I believe this makes it hard to draw conclusions with respect to Shyam et al and Pathak et al and adding these missing comparisons would strengthen the paper substantially in my view.\n\nMinor\np3: \"Let f denote the dynamics model\" \u2013 I believe it would be good to mention the signature of this function (it can be inferred from Figure 1, but it would be nice to make this explicit).\nQuestions to Authors"}
