While the paper is heavily influenced by the recent Skewfit work (Pong et al, 2019),  it aims to solve a different problem (that of exploration for sparse reward RL), since Skewfit is interested in exploration and goal sampling for self-supervised (i.e. no external rewards) RL. The central idea in this paper is to encourage exploration by maintaining a distribution over the \"current frontier\", i.e. the set of points in the state space that are closed to the \"edge\" of what is explored by the policy , sampling points around this frontier, and encouraging the policy to reach these sampled points. The paper compares to RND (a method that is representative of state-of-the-art in exploration bonuses, I believe) and also to Skewfit, and outperforms these methods in two non-standard environments: door opening and point-mass navigation. \n\nWhile the I think the empirical contributions are solid, and authors provide code to reproduce the results, I found the paper a bit hard to follow and understand, and different subsections in the technical section (Section 3) did not seem to have a unified narrative running through them. I will wait to see if other reviewers agree or disagree with me on this front, and if they do agree, then I think the paper will need substantial edits to improve its clarity before it is ready for publication.
