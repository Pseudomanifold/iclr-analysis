The paper assumes that the state space can be divided into two parts - the state of the robot (\u201ccontext states\u201d) which is controllable via actions and the state of an object (\u201cstates of interest\u201d) which must be manipulated by the robot. Given these two categories of states, the proposed algorithm maximizes a lower bound on the mutual information between the two categories of states such that a policy is learnt that is able to manipulate the object with the robot meaningfully.\n\nI vote for weak reject as (1) the paper makes a strong assumption about the availability of both the robot and object states which is not realistic in typical robotic manipulation applications and (2) the objective in the paper will not work if there is no notion of an \u201cobject\u201d or object-state e.g.: this algorithm will not learn skills for a robot trying to control itself; hence, it is not truly a general purpose skill discovery algorithm but rather a skill discovery algorithm specifically meant for robot-object manipulation tasks.\n\nMy main concern with the paper is its limited applicability to robotic manipulation tasks with a clear divide between states of interest vs others. The paper does not talk about settings where states of interest are not known, so all of the experiments are based on this strong assumption. It doesn\u2019t seem like a surprising discovery that maximizing the mutual information between the robot state and object state will lead to skills that actually make the robot move the object.\n\nGiven that object manipulation is the specific application of interest, the comparison with DIAYN and the combined objective with DIAYN is interesting but little motivation or discussion has been provided in the paper. Can the authors elaborate on why this choice should intuitively be better than the proposed method alone?\n\nThe paper does not talk about how these skills can be used as primitive actions by a higher level controller (in a hierarchical RL setup), which would help in demonstrating the usefulness of these skills - e.g.: are these skills sequentially composable such that they can solve a complex task?\n"}
