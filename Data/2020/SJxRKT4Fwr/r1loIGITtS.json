In particular, the paper studies the effect of generalized forms of self-attention that can attend across dimensions of the input.\n\nGeneralizing self attention to work across dimensions of a multi dimensional time series is a good idea, and the experiments in the paper seem to support its effectiveness.  The paper does provide some ablation results to compare their three forms of modified self attention, which is good.  I believe the primary contribution of the paper is as an empirical study into the effectiveness of generalized self attention in time series datasets.\n\nHowever, I have to vote to reject the paper.\n\nMy primary issue with the paper is its tone.  While generalized forms of self attention are a good idea, the paper strongly emphasizes that it is a novel idea.  In particular, image models that use self attention regularly attend too multiple dimensions.  Consider for instance arXiv:1802.05751, arXiv:1904.09793, arXiv:1712.09763, arXiv:1805.08318.\n\nThere is also several existing generalized self attention discussions: arXiv:1812.01243 or arXiv:1805.00912\n\nThe idea of extending self attention to look at multiple dimensions is fairly obvious.  If the paper changed its tone from purporting to construct a novel method of self-attention (which I do not believe it does), to being an empirical study of the utility of self attention models for doing time series imputation I would be much more willing to accept it, though as a purely empirical study the bar would be high on the standard of the experiments, the reported experiments are on rather small datasets.\n\nAlso, the paper could use an edit for grammar."}
