Specifically, the authors propose to use (i) better integrator, (ii) multi-step learning, and (iii) initial state optimization. Authors experimentally show that all these improvements are beneficial in modelling complex and noisy Hamiltonian systems.\n\n\nMy Comments:\n\nI come from RNNs background and I am not an expert on physical systems. But the paper is extremely well written that I can easily follow. Experiments are convincing.\n\nI do not have any issues with the claims.\n\nAre the authors willing to release their code to reproduce the results?\n"}
