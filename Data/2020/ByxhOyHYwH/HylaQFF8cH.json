It has two main contributions. The first one is to use a metric-softmax loss used to train on the meta-training dataset without episodic updates. The second is that the features learnt thereby are further modified using a linear transformation to fit the few-shot training data and the metric soft-max loss is again used for classifying the query samples. The authors provide experimental results for 5-way-1-shot and 5-way-5-shot testing on mini-Imagenet and CUB-200-2011 datasets.\n\nI think this paper is below the acceptance threshold. The reasons are:\n\n1. The contributions of this paper are marginal: both learning centroids for each meta-training class and projecting the few-shot features have been used before in published work (https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04398). The empirical results are weaker than existing work (see for instance, https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03758, https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.02729 etc.); also see #3 below.\n2. The authors should provide experimental results on other few-shot learning datasets like tiered-Imagenet.\n3. The image-size used here for Resnet-12 is 224x224, the authors should report results using 84x84 image size so that one can compare against existing literature fairly. Are the results for Resnet-12 so good because of the larger image size?\n4. The training procedure is task-agnostic, why do you train a different model for the 1-shot and the 5-shot case?\n\nI will consider increasing my score if some of the concerns above are addressed. I am listing some more comments below which I would like the authors to consider.\n\n\n1. Contributions: \u201cconsistency between training and inference\u201d, do you instead mean consistency between meta-training and few-shot training? There are no weight updates at inference time.\n2. How essential is the metric-softmax loss? Training on the meta-training dataset without episodic updates has also been done in https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.02729. These authors seem to use standard soft-max training and perform standard fine-tuning, they report empirical performance that is significantly better than that in Table 4 and Figure 2. I am very skeptical as to why the accuracy of fine-tuning is only 21% in Figure 2.\n3. Section 3.2 does not motivate or explain the metric-softmax loss. Why should one have the network learn the centroids of the meta-training dataset? Can you draw a TSNE of the centroids learnt during meta-training? The features of the support samples (or their transformations) can be the centroids of the few-shot classes in the prototypical loss so inference phase does not need these centroids.\n4. I am not sure whether the matrix M is changed non-trivially during few-shot training. The weights W are already initialized to be the centroid of the features (eqn. 9). So the metric-softmax loss in eqn. 10 is expected to be small for the support samples after initialization. Why should the additional expression power afforded by M matter? There is no incentive for the network to change the matrix M. Can you show results on how much M changes from the identity?\n5. I believe the reported numerical results for LEO (Rusu et al. 2019) are for a WRN-28-10 architecture, not ResNet-12.\n6. The accuracy using Resnet-12 seem extremely high. I believe this is because the results reported in the literature, e.g., https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03758, use images of size 84x84, not 224x224 as the authors here have used. Can you report results using 84x84 sized images?\n7. I don\u2019t understand the explanation at the end of Section 5. Since the prototypical loss is being used to classify the query datum, it should not matter whether the cluster is shrunk in the 5-shot case, or whether simply the distances between the clusters are increased as in the 1-shot case.\n8. Table 1 is quite incomplete, the authors should mention other existing few-shot classification results are similar to the performance of this paper, e.g., https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.10123, among the ones listed above.\n9.
