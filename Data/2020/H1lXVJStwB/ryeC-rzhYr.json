It formulates DIH as a curriculum learning problem, and derives theory on the approximation bound. The method is verified by a set of experiments. There are  several concerns raised by the reviewer.\n\nI found the presentation of this paper is rather bad. The structure of the paper is quite strange. The Introduction section contains a lot of stuffs that I believe should be moved to the preliminary or method sections. \n\nAlso, there are a lot of confusions in the descriptions. For example, when defining the curriculum learning problem in eq.2 and eq.3, are the f's the same? If so, why do they have different input arguments?\n\n\"In step t, after the model gets trained on S_t, the feedback a_t(i) for i \\in S_t is already available\": I don't get this.\n\nI am not sure what Theorem 1 tries to tell. If one chooses k large enough, the inequality satisfies trivially. BTW, what is A_{1:T}?\n\nTo sump up, there are some interesting ideas in this paper. However, with the current stage of writing, I cannot recommend acceptance.\n\n"}
