The paper would've been strongly if it had the following:\n\n1. Considered more structural features than simple node degree and clustering coefficient.  Prior work [1] has looked at such features and answered questions like: How do structural features improve classification performance?And, which structural features are the most useful? \n\n2. Investigated which graph neural network performs better for which graph structures (preferential attachment, small world, regular, etc) and for how much homophily.  \n\n3. Investigated the robustness of graph neural networks on classification as the structure of graphs become more random (e.g., by rewiring edges while maintaining degree distribution).\n\n[1] B.
