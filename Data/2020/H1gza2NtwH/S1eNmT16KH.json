The paper is well written with sound theoretical reasoning and empirical validation. However, the reviewer has the following concerns:\n\nAs to the assumption in this paper, it is too strong to assume independence between different elements of Hessian, Wigner ensemble seems to be a better model, since the only independence only comes from samples instead of the elements of the Hessian. This would require a completely different analysis to deal with.\nFurthermore, it seems that Lemma 1 and Theorem 1 are asymptotic results. I don\u2019t see how these are related to the empirical validation, since in experiments the compared dataset are CIFAR-10/CIFAR-100 and augmented CIFAR-10/CIFAR-100, which only differs in the number of samples. It makes more sense to have a non-asymptotic analysis here.\n"}
