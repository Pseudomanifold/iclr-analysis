The results are very impressive on a ImageNet (but maybe not so impressive on the other benchmarks). The authors also discuss how to speed up inference and present some frightening runtime numbers for the serial method, and some better numbers for the vectorized version, though they're nowhere close to being practical.\n\nI think this paper should be accepted. It has a better description of the BB ANS algorithm than I have read before, and it's a truly interesting direction for the field, despite the lack of immediate applicability.\n\nIf we are to accept this paper, I suggest the authors put a full description of the neural network used (it's barely mentioned). I think the authors also need to disclose how long it took to compress an average imagenet image (looking at the runtime numbers for 128x128 pixels is scary, but at least we'd get a better picture on the feasability).\n\nOverall, due to the fact that the authors pledge to open source the framework, I think some of the details will be found in the code, once released. I think this is an important step because there are so many details in this paper that one cannot reasonably reproduce the work by simply reading the text of this paper."}
