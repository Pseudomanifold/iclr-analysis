The authors show the connection to a smoothness with respect to a general norm, which is further related to a bound on the Hessian. Based on the interpretation of steepest descent, the authors compare the behavior of sign gradient descent with the gradient descent, and show that the relative behavior depends on both the percentage of diagonal ? and the spread of eigenvalues. Some experimental results are reported to verify the theory.\n\nThe paper is very well written and easy to follow. The theoretical analysis is sound and intuitive. However, the paper considers a variant of sign gradient descent where the l_1 norm of the gradients are introduced. The introduction of this l_1 norm is required for the interpretation of a steep descent but is not the one used often in practice.\n\nMost analysis seem follows from standard arguments. The extension from gradient descent to the steep descent with a general norm is a bit standard. In this sense, the paper is a bit incremental.\n"}
