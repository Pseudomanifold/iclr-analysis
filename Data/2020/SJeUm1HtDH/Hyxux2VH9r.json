The data is rather novel, is large enough to do ML (around 17 hours of eventful audio/video) and is to be publicly released.  The model architectures  are not of theoretical novelty.   However, the experiments are somewhat interesting.  It was found that the audio contains significant object classification information.  The audio was also good for predicting the trajectory of the object.  This might not be surprising since the microphones are geometrically arranged and may contain directional information along with information about velocity and/or distance traveled.   Overall the experiments are rather thin with only a few experimental results.   A more thorough undertaking might be expected for ICLR papers, with more novel theoretical development and more extensive experiments.  "}
