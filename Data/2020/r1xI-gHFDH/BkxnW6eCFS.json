The approach is rather a mix of previous works and hence not novel. \n\nIn particular, the algorithm for WL decomposition is almost fully taken from the original paper with a slight modification. Advantage of using it for unlabeled data is poorly motivated as unlabeled graphs can easily take statistics such as degree as the node labels, which was shown well in practice. \n\nModified PV-DBOW is in fact the same algorithm as the original CBOW model but applied to different context. It has been used in many papers, including Deep GK, graph2vec, anonymous walks. \n\nAlso, the Figure 1. is taken from the original paper of WL kernel. The algorithms 1 and 2 are taken from the original papers with slight modifications. \n\nThere is no discussion of [1], which uses CBOW framework, has theoretical properties, and produces good results in experiments. There is no comparison with GNN models such as [2]. \n\nI would be more interested to see explanation of the obtained results for each particular dataset (e.g. why MUTAG has 92% accuracy and PTC 67%); what so different about dataset and whether we reached a limit on most commonly used datasets. \n\n[1] Anonymous Walk Embeddings?
