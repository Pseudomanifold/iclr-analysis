It is essentially a collection of engineering steps that improve the time to validation accuracy.\n\nWhile I'm not an expert in (G)NN acceleration on TPUs, I have experience with GNNs and approaches to accelerate CNNs in GPUs. My assessment is that the scope of this work is far too narrow. It is specific to GGSNNs which is a small family of GNNs not widely used. It is also specific to TPUs and lacks evaluations of the proposed approach on other type of hardware.\n\nIt is for these reasons that I think the paper is not appropriate for ICLR. The scope has to be broadened both in terms of the NN models and the hardware types. \n"}
