The author introduces a Monte Carlo-based optimization to solve the inefficiency problem in the discrete proposal-based forward process defined in (Crawford and Pineau 2019). Also, the paper redefines the decoder part for self-supervised from minimizing reconstruction loss with background segmentation to maximize reconstruction error with learning a foreground segmentation. \u00a0The method is then verified with a suite of experiments for people-detection on video datasets.\n\nThe main benefit over many previous unsupervised object detection/segmentation approaches is that they did not make use of optical flow or other readily available cues during training. However, given that the framework directly came from (Crawford & Pineau 2019), and the only change is from variational inference to an importance-sampling (MC) approach. This would be fine if it is verified in experiments, however, the experiments did not show any comparison w.r.t. (Crawford & Pineau 2019) hence we have no way of understanding what is the relative performance w.r.t. that baseline approach.\n\nBesides, in all the experiments a single object is in the view. How does the method perform in images where multiple objects are in the view?\n\nA little bit of a philosophical question is whether this a problem worth pursuing as well. For self-supervised motion estimation (e.g. optical flow), it is clear why we want to do that. However, the current type of algorithm is dependent on the assumption that the background follows relatively consistent textures, this may not necessarily be true in practice, and hence the application could be quite limited. Many previous unsupervised video object segmentation methods make use of optical flow and boundary detection, which I thought are OK cues to be used, especially when both can be learned in a self-supervised manner. This is not entirely related to the assessment, but I would still like to hear what the authors think.\n\nMinor:\nIn the paragraph after 'Training strategy'(Section 3.2, Page 5), is it 'the foreground objective O of Eq. (2)' or 'Eq.(4)'?\n\n"}
