Though the model resembles FiLM(Perez et al., 2018), it outperforms FiLM by a larger margin in three dataset.\n\nIt would be better for authors to give more detailed comparisons with models that work on combining both joint training and independent training.\n\nI would like to see the paper to be accepted for its simplicity and effectiveness.\n\nTypos: chnages -> changes?"}
