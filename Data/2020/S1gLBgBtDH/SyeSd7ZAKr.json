The framework is well structured and modular. Thus, it is easily extendable for anyone and can be a pinnacle for future RL research. \n\nThe really like the paper. It is well written, easy to read, and provide a valuable platform / framework to the community, both the scientific community as well as practitioners. Although the scientific contribution may be low in the paper, I think the significance and potential impact of the paper outweigh that. \n\nThe paper also include many results from running the framework in various configurations, showing the flexibility and usefulness of it.\n\nThe code for SLM Lab is released open source, which is very valuable and enables future research in RL. \n"}
