First, the authors have introduced the concept of BAS (Budget-Aware Schedule). Various LRSs are classified, and it is experimentally shown that the LRSs based on BAS performed better. Among them, the performance of the linear decay method was shown to be simple and robust.\n\nPros\n\n1. Formally define important and well-motivated issues to improve performance on a limited budget.\n2. Various experimental results show that the simple linear decay method works well, and it might become a baseline method for future budgeted training solutions (assuming there is no similar work with the same purpose).\n3. It seems to be easy to apply to the NAS,  and the experiments in Appendix A look a big plus. This section can be put into the main paper.\n\nCons\n\n1. No sound theory as to why linear decay or other smooth decay methods work well.\n2. As Mishkin et al. [1] have already experimented with linear decay, the novelty of the methodology proposed by the authors might be limited.\n\nWhile there is some concern regarding the significance of novelty,  the paper seems meaningful enough to be accepted.\n\n[1] Dmytro Mishkin, Nikolay Sergievskiy, and Jiri Matas.
