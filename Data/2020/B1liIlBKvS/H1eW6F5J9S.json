It is found that communication can emerge in partially-competitive scenarios, and conditions in which this can happen are investigated.\nThis review is delivered with the caveat that I am not an expert in this particulat field.\nThe investigation seems relevant and the paper is well written and structured, being within the scope of the conference. Proofs in the appendix are sound to the best of my understanding.\nThe literature review is up to date and seems overall relevant.\nThis study should be understood as a proof of concept, given that the setting seems rather restrictive, so I am unsure that he results could be generalized.\nThey seem anyhow promising and partially challenge the current understanding of the problem.\nMinor issues:\nAll acronyms in the text should be defined the first time they appear in the text.\nLaTex problem with Fig. reference at the beginning of section 5.1."}
