The authors find that communication can also emerge in partially-competitive scenarios and demonstrate how to encourage communication: 1) selfish communication is proportional to cooperation, and it naturally occurs for situations that are more cooperative than competitive, 2) stability and performance are improved by using LOLA, and 3) discrete protocols are better than continuous ones.\n\nStrengths:\n- This is an interesting paper that is well written and motivated.\n- They have justified a new sender-receiver game that can be tuned for various levels of competition which then allows them to analyze the effects of various levels of cooperation and competition.\n- They perform sufficient experimental analysis to show that LOLA outperforms standard methods like REINFORCE in these settings and that discrete communication lends to cooperative communication.\n- Evaluation is good in the sense that they repeat their experiments multiple times across different random seeds.\n\nWeaknesses:\n- Given that cheap talk is an extremely well-studied topic in economics, I feel that the authors should have devoted more time to explain the difference in setting between their work in classic pieces like those of Sobel and Crawford. The authors should properly define what they mean by learning agents versus fully rational agents, and the key differences between the two. Furthermore, nowhere do the authors in the cheap talk paper assert that agents use an existing language: the equilibrium itself assigns meaning to each sender\u2019s message; this is not part of the problem definition per se. In fact, the work of Sobel and Crawford does not even constrain the size of the vocabulary (as was done in this paper): one of its key contributions is to show that in strictly non-cooperative settings, all equilibria must be partition equilibria, with only a finite number of messages used.\n- Section 4.2: \u201cinitial random mapping of targets to messages.\u201d The authors made the assumption that this mapping has to be deterministic. Absent a proof or a citation, I find this difficult to accept. This is especially so since mixed strategies are a crucial component of games of imperfect information.\n- The introduction of the circular game is suspect. There already exist numerous games involving cheap talk, one of them from the Sobel and Crawford paper. Why is there a need for this new benchmark?\n-  The description of the game is given as an algorithm in the appendix. This comes across as counterintuitive: why are the gradient steps being included as part of the game description? A game\u2019s specification and the algorithm which is being used to solve it are two different things.\n- It is difficult for me to assess the significance of these results since the authors have not presented real-world scenarios and experiments that demonstrate the importance of selfish communication. For cooperative communication we see it a lot in examples like grounded language learning, visual dialog, multi-agent communication etc. But I am concerned that the new setting proposed in this paper seems like a 'toy setting' to investigate if emergent communication would happen.\n- Are the communicated symbols (discrete or continuous) semantically meaningful? It was shown in Kottur et al. (2017) that for emergent communication to occur and generalize to unseen test instances, it was crucial that the communication protocol was grounded i.e. one symbol learning to represent the color, one representing the shape, one representing the size. What is the final communication protocol learned in this case, and it is useful/interpretable in a similar sense?\n- Typo: 'Figure ??' in line 3 of section 5.1"}
