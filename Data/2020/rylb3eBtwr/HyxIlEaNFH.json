Presentation is clear and it is easy to follow.\nThe proposed approach is a simple combination of existing approaches.\nAlthough its theoretical analysis with respect to the performance of anomaly detection is limited, experiments show that the proposed method is effective and superior to the existing anomaly detection methods.\n\nI have the following comments:\n- Parameter sensitivity should be examined.\n    The proposed method has the number of parameters including \\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, and parameters in neural networks.\n    Since parameter tuning is fundamentally difficult in the unsupervised setting, the sensitivity of the proposed method with respect to changes of such parameters should be examined.\n- Since the efficiency is also an important issue for anomaly detection methods, runtime comparison would be interesting.\n- It would be also interesting whether the proposed method is also effective for non-structured data, where a dataset is given as just a set of (real-valued) feature vectors, with its comparison to the standard anomaly detection methods such as LOF and iForest.\n"}
