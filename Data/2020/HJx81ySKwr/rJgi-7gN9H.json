It proposes to use VAE to model the anomaly detection. The major concern is how the quality of f_{VAE} is estimated. From the paper it seems f_{VAE} is not updated. Will it be sufficient to rely a fixed f_{VAE} and blindly trust its quality?\n\nDetailed Comments:\n- Table 1: It is not clear how \"the mean improvement rate of 9.52% over all baselines\" was calculated.\n- Figure 3: Will VAE-grad or DASE-grad perform better? Since these base lines are used in other places, it is better to compare with them as well. "}
