It shows that current boolean node classifiers on AC-GNNs can only represent a subset of FOC2 but that a simple extension taking into global information can generalise AC-GNNs to the full FOC2.\n\nThe style of the manuscript is mixed: the abstract and introduction are quite dense for non-experts; a motivating real-world example could help here. The other sections, on the other hand, are quite good to follow and most concepts have a good high-level introduction as well as a little example to follow the arguments.\n\nThe theoretical connections connection between GNNs and first-order logic strike me as interesting. I did not, however, understand the results reported in table 2: ACR reaches optimal performance only on alpha_1 but not on alpha_2 and alpha_3. Does this happen because the latter two expressions are not part of FOC2?"}
