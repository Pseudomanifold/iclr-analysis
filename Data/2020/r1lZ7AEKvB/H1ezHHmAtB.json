More precisely, the authors show that expressivity of AC-GNNs (aggregate and combine) can only express logical classifiers that can be expressed in graded modal logic. By adding readouts, ACR-GNNs (aggregate, combine and readout) can capture FOC2 which is logical classifiers expressed with 2 variables and counting quantifiers. The second theorem leaves open the question of whether ACR-GNNs can capture logical classifiers beyond FOC2.\n\nThe paper is written nicely, its easy on the eyes, and delegates the proofs to the appendix. I was a bit surprised by the lack of a discussion connecting the choice of the aggregate and combine operations to the representation power of GNNs. One has to delve deep into the proofs to find out if the choice of these operations affects expressivity."}
