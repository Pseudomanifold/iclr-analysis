The parameter remapping uses weights from the source neural network to the two-stages: architecture adaption phase and parameter adaption phase. The technique results in improvements in both performance and training time.\n\nI like the direction this paper takes, NAS is too expensive and we need faster methods through meta learning/transfer learning. The paper is also clearly organized and written.  To the best of my knowledge, the experiments setting is sensible and the results are good. But I am not in the Computer Vision field and I am not so familiar with NAS, I may missed something. Thus, I am less confident about my rating."}
