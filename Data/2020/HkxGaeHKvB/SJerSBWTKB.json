The algorithm is based on the principle of computing stochastic gradients at configurable observation points. Their main novelty as opposed to CNAG is that instead of approximating NAG for exact gradients, it adjusts the learning rates for eigen directions with different curvatures, thus accelerating convergence in the stochastic setting. The authors analyze the algorithm's convergence rate first via a data dependent regret bound for convex functions and provide a O(log(T)) regret bound for strongly convex objectives. They run experiments demonstrating their algorithm is competitive against other adaptive methods such as ADAM. \n\nThe writeup is hard to read. It would benefit from a more concise and intuitive explanation of the proposed algorithm. The approach seems well motivated. It is a noble task to obtain adaptive algorithms with convergence rates. The experiments are on standard MNIST and CIFAR datasets and are conducted vs a variety of other algorithms showing their algorithm performs well in comparison. \n\nMy main concerns are twofold. One, the paper seems to have been written in a hasty way which makes the presentation very hard to follow. It would greatly benefit from a major rewrite, focused on fleshing out the novel / challenging / related work aspects of the work. It isn't clear what is the problem this paper is set to solve that other algorithms don't do well at. The algorithm does perform well in practice. It does seem it has promise. The theory seems correct, and the techniques are standard."}
