It is well written and there are nice examples to illustrate the central ideas. However, I do have some criticisms:\n\n1. The writing in this paper is sometimes pompous. Quoting James Scott has no added value to this work. Reference to Adam Smith\u2019s invisible hand not only has no added value but is also confusing and detracts from the paper \u2014 SM-games are not purporting to be real economic models.\n2. Throughout the paper there is a confusing mix between ideas from economics and ideas from accounting. For example, it is not correct to say that aggregate revenue is the same as GDP. Revenue is an accounting term to show how much benefit you record in a year. GDP measures the value of\u00a0production. It would be more accurate to write that aggregate output and GDP are the same. But if SM-games are reflecting the perspective of an accountant, as is stated, why is GDP being discussed at all? Similarly, the idea of a dummy player with off the book costs is not consistent with an accounting perspective. I think that the paper would be clearest if it did not attempt to use terminology from other fields. But if it is going to do so, it should make a more substantial effort to do so consistently."}
