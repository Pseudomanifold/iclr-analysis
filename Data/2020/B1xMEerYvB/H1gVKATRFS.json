The paper is clear, concise, and well-written, and hence I do not have any overarching comments. There are several suggestions and questions, though, that I\u2019d like to propose.\n\n1. Since many concepts are not from the machine learning domain, further and more detailed touch on related work are very beneficial. The current section of related work (Section 1.2) is more succinct than laying the right background information. Authors could consider giving some examples of \u201cmarket mechanism\u201d, and similarly for \u201cdesign pattern\u201d. This can give readers some ideas on how this present work\u2019s use of \u201cexisting design pattern\u201d is different from prior works\u2019 proposals of \u201cmarket mechanism\u201d. Again for the second paragraph, although these concepts are more familiar to the audience, a short description for each mentioned concept is good to include (e.g. monotone games, etc)\n\n2. Move Lemma 1 before Definition 2? Since Lemma 1 is most related to Definition 1 and not related to Definition 2.\n\n3. For Definition 2, authors could consider adding \u201cthe classic definition [of Nash equilibrium]\u201d to the list to clarify the difference. This classic Nash equilibrium definition will be referred to again in later sections. \n\n4. In Section 2.1, consider giving a formal definition of \u201cpotential game\u201d.\n\n5. In Section 2.3, it is not immediately clear after the text why stop_gradient becomes a problem.\n\n6. In Section 3.1, could we elucidate a bit on what is \u201cnear zero sum\u201d?\n\n7. In Section 5, why the equation following the text \u201cfirm i\u2019s forecast\u201d is always positive? Since by definition, forecast is meant to represent the change of profit, which can be negative?\n"}
