The proposed model is simple and interesting making clever use of labels in the source domain. While the theory is motivated well and seems convincing, I am not entirely sure of the empirical results.\nThere are no significant improvements of the proposed model over the baselines considered except on STFL-CIFAR data set. An analysis of why this improvement is observed would be good.\n\nI also wonder on how did the cluster quality on the target domain compare with that obtained by the AssocDA baseline. Also coming to the parameter sigma in the Gaussian similarity function, it would be nice to see the values of sigma reported in either the body of the paper or in a supplement.\nI will admit I have not thoroughly checked the math in Theorem 1, but the supporting mathematical equations seem plausible."}
