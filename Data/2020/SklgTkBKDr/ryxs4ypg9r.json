While sensible, this seems to me to be too minor a contribution to stand alone as a paper.\n\nAdditionally, I believe the experimental tasks are new, and as a result all implementations of competing techniques are by the paper authors. This makes it difficult to have confidence in the higher reported performance of the proposed techniques."}
