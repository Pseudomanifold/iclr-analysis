The two architectures are inspired by the discrete Choquet integral. The proposed models are evaluated on visual and textual data against an MLP baseline and deep sets. \n\nOverall, the paper is clearly written and easily understandable. However, the novelty of the paper is limited and the empirical support of the proposed models is insufficient. The motivation of using \"Choquet integral\" seems obscure to me. The author might want to provide a short introduction to Choquet integral and elaborate on the connection with the proposed models. The proposed models seem very basic and do not have much novelty. The tasks in the experimental study seem overly simple. The authors might want to consider other tasks, for example, Point Cloud Classification in [1]. \n\nQuestions:\n* For RCN and DCR, how to decide the ordering of phi_i, given that they are the objects of an unordered set?\n* It would be helpful it the authors can also provide the number of parameters of the baseline models in Tables 1, 2, and 3.\n* To model the interaction among objects in a set, GNN might be a better choice than RNN.\n\n[1] Zaheer, Manzil, et al. \"Deep sets.\" Advances in neural information processing systems. 2017."}
