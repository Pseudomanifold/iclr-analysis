The main idea of the paper is to augment existing datasets with minimally counteractual versions of them, that change the sentiment of the documents. In this way, all spurious factors will naturally cancel out. The authors use the newly created datasets and show that indeed, the retrained algorithms on the augmented datasets generalize much better.\n\nThe main contribution of the paper is the introduction of the idea of counterfactual datasets for sentiment analysis.\n\nOverall, I find the idea of the paper quite interesting and I\u2019m excited to use the datasets they have created. However, I think the relative novelty of the paper does not meet ICLR standards, and it\u2019s better suited as a whitepaper attached to an open dataset release."}
