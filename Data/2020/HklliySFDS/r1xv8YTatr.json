Then, I hesitate to evaluate the model in terms of performance. In that sense, it would be much crucial to show more meaningful ablation studies and analysis for proposed model. However, there is a few of thing about them. \n\nThen, I decide to give a lower score that even the authors suggest that the main contribution is a definition of problem setting. It requires more detailed and sophisticated analysis.\n          \n"}
