Instead of using general vector fields, the authors apply the potential vector fields in optimal transport theory to design neural networks. The mathematics is correct with convincing examples. This brings an important mathematical connection between fluid dynamics and GANs or implicit models. \n\nI suggest the acceptance of this paper after addressing the following minor questions. \n\n1. Would the authors provide slightly more details about the design of networks? \n\n2. In the literature, the author may need to cite \n\n\"A. Lin, W. Li, S. Osher, G.
