The approach can be used for clustering and generation. The authors carry out experiments to evaluate the performance of the method in these tasks and compare it to competing methods.\n\nThe paper is well written and easy to read and understand. Specialized related work is discussed. I find the extension of VAEs to GMMs interesting for the ICLR community, although it is somewhat straight forward in terms of its technical difficulty. However, the technical novelty together with the fine empirical evaluation are just good enough for ICLR, in my opinion.\n"}
