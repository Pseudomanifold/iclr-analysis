The formulation seem sound and the experiments show improvements wrt competitors in terms of performance and query efficiency with comparable attack success rates.\n\n* In section 4.3 the authors claim that the additive surrogate makes the GP-based BO able to deal with the problem of high dimensionality. Given that the typical dimensionality for BayesOpt is d <= 20, how are the experiments with dimensions up to 14x14x3 provided for GP-BO and GP-BO-auto-dT performed?\n\n* The image selection protocol seems arbitrary and it does not correspond to the Tu et al. protocol which selects 50 random images from  CIFAR-100 and MNIST.\n\n* I feel the experiments lack some details: which is the decoder used for dimensionality reduction?\n\n"}
