First, a high-to-low network is trained to generate realistic HR/LR image pairs for training super-resolution models. Using this network, the authors designed a large-scale General Mobile Super Resolution Dataset, GMSR, which can be utilized for training or as a benchmark for super-resolution methods. Second, a low-to-high network is trained to produce a super-resolution image. Bene\ufb01ting from the GMSR dataset and novel training strategies, the proposed low-to-high network could thus deal with the real distortions and restore \ufb01ne details.\n\nThe paper is easy to follow. The proposed framework is logical and the experiments proved to be effective. However, there are some problems as follows:\n\n1. In the high-to-low network of framework, Gaussian random noise is added to clean high-resolution images to simulate the randomness of the distortions in LR. Why can do this in this way? The rationality of this setting should be given. Are there other kinds of noises be applied? As far as I knew, the in-camera processing pipeline will involve  Poisson-Gaussian noise rather than Gaussian only and other factors such as demosaicing, Gamma correction, and JPEG compression. It is hard to only consider Gaussian noise to stimulate the whole in-camera process. \n\n2. The experimental part is remarkable insufficient to an ICLR paper. There only have a quantitative evaluation of the proposed framework with other super-resolution algorithms, while lacking the qualitative evaluation of the framework itself. \n\n3.
