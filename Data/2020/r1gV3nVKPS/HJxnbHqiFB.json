Specifically, the ballistic graph neural network does not require to calculate any eigenvalue and can propagate exponentially faster comparing to traditional graph neural network. Extensive experiments have been conducted to verify the performance of the proposed method.\n\n1. The motivation of this method is to accelerate the diffusion speed in a graph. However, as we know, a very severe issue of graph neural network is the over-smoothness issue. The reason is that, in the high layer, the node feature is diffused to far neighbours.  When using the proposed ballistic filter, node features diffuse much faster than the regular GNN. Thus, the over-smoothness will appear in the shallow layer very fast. As a result, we cannot use many layers so that the non-linearity of deep neural networks cannot be fully utilized. Thus, is it necessary to accelerate the diffusion speed for graph neural network?\n\n2. There is only one dataset for  the comparison of the performance of different graph neural networks. More datasets are needed to thoroughly verify the performance of the proposed ballistic graph neural network.\n\n3. Is it possible to slow down the diffusion speed with the proposed ballistic filter?\n\n\n"}
