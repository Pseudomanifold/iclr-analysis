They propose a two-step generation process, where a sketch is first generated from the summary, and then the articles is generated from the sketch. Reinforcement learning is used for model training. \n\nI think the task is interesting. My major concern lies in the evaluation. Since the task is about article-level generation, i.e. long text generation, it would be necessary to evaluate the structure or discours flow of the text in addition to relevance. It is not extremely hard for neural models to generate content that is relevant to the prompt (e.g. summaries), from my opinion, the difficulty comes from how to maintain a coherent and connective discourse flow rather than drifting away to various topics or producing repetitive or generic content. However, none of these aspects is evaluated in the submission. I would suggest the authors consider these generation quality aspects. \n\n\nOther comments:\n- The lengths of the generated articles should be reported, since different lengths of articles would significantly affect the perception of their relevance and quality.\n\n- The author should commment on ethical concerns of the task. Since the summary only contains a subset of the information from the article, the model tends to generate fabricated content by filling in the rest of the narrative. This issue should be addressed in the discussion section. \n\n- Fig 8&9 captions are incorrect."}
