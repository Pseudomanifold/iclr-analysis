The method relies on a simple multi-task objective which provides initial parameter values for the adaptation phase. Adaptation is performed by gradient descent, minimizing TD-error on the new validation task (regularizing towards initial parameter values). To make adaptation data efficient, the method makes heavy use of off-policy data generated during meta-training, by minimizing its importance weighted TD-error. Importance weights are estimated via a likelihood ratio estimator, and are also used to derive the effective sample size of the meta-training batch, which is used to adaptively weight the regularization term. Intuitively, this has the effect of turning off regularization when meta-training trajectories are \u201cclose\u201d to validation trajectories. One important but somewhat orthogonal contribution of the paper is to highlight the importance of context in meta-learning and fast adaptation. Concretely, the authors show that a simple actor-critic algorithm (TD3), whose policy and value are conditioned on a context variable derived from a recurrent network performs surprisingly well in comparison to SoTA meta-learning algorithms like PEARL. MQL is evaluated on benchmark meta-RL environments from continuous control tasks and is shown to perform competitively with PEARL.\n\nI have mixed opinions on this paper. On the positive side, and subject to further clarifications (see below), the paper seems to confirm that multi-task learning is almost sufficient to solve current meta-RL benchmarks in continuous control, without adaptation, as long as policy and critic are conditioned on a recurrent task context. This either highlights the strength of multi-task learning, or the inadequacies of current meta-RL benchmarks: either of which will be of interest to the community. On the other hand, the proposed MQL algorithm is only shown to significantly outperform this new baseline TD3-context agent on 1 of 6 tasks (Ant-Goal-2D), and furthermore the ablative analysis seems to suggest that the importance weighting and adaptive weighting of trust region are not very effective, and do not significantly change the performance of the method. The take-away seems to be that while context is crucial to generalization on these validation tasks, adaptation is not but can indeed be improved in a data-efficient manner with fine-tuning. MQL is only then a second thread to this story.\n\n\nClarifying Questions:\n\n* The text and figures could be much clearer with respect to what is being measured/presented. Can you confirm that you report average validation returns as a function of meta-training steps, where validation performance is estimated after training on (at most) 2x200 transitions from the validation task (|D_new|=400)? This would match the protocol from PEARL. Fig 4(a) would then imply that one can get close to SoTA results on Ant-Fwd-Back + Half-Cheetah-Fwd-Back with no adaptation whatsoever (using TD3-context).\n* Could the authors provide more details about how context is generated, in particular whether the GRU is reset on episode boundaries or not? If the recurrent context does span episode boundaries, are rewards being maximizing over a horizon greater than the episode length (similar to RL2)?\n* How do you reconcile your result that a deterministic encoder is sufficient, compared to Figure 7 of PEARL which shows stochasticity is paramount for performing structured exploration during adaptation?\n* Ablative analysis seems to suggest that off-policy learning plays a very minimal role during adaptation (beta=0). Can you confirm this interpretation? Would this not suggest that regularization via fine-tuning (regularized to multi-task prior) and context are sufficient to solve these meta-RL tasks? This would be a sufficient contribution by itself but unfortunately does little to validate the proposed method.\n* Could you repeat the ablative analysis on all of the 6 tasks? Currently, this is performed on the two tasks for which TD3-context does best which leaves little room for improvement.\n* Section 4.4. Propensity Score Estimation. \u201cUse this model to sample transitions from the replay buffer that are similar to the new task\u201d. Is this done via rejection sampling? This should be described more prominently in Section 3, along with a detailed description of the proposed MQL algorithm.\n\nDetailed Comments:\n* Paper desperately needs an algorithmic box, which clear and concise description of algorithm (how losses are interleaved, etc). Importantly, do the authors pretrain \\theta_meta using the multi-task loss before doing adapation?\n* Please add more informative labels to axes for all your figures: timesteps for [validation,training] ? Same for return. Please also augment captions to make figures as stand-alone as possible.\n* MQL encompasses technique for off-policy training using a discriminator to estimate a likelihood ratio. It would be nice to evaluate this in standard off-policy learning setting, instead of it being limited to meta-learning."}
