The authors testified the proposed algorithm using the Relations Game, whose aim is to label an image containing a number of objects as True or False according to whether a given relationship holds among the objects in the image. This paper is well organized. The applied methods are introduced in detail. The authors showed the improvement using the Relations Game."}
