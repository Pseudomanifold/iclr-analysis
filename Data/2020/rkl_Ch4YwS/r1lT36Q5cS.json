The paper is written well, and easy to read. In the experiments, the recognition and translation methods both work well on Homologous and non-Homologous test data. In particular, the proposed method improved the performance over the state-of-the-art method Im2LaTex. Addtionally, the authors visualised the sample alignments of encoder-decoder model, which is helpful for understanding the method.\n\nA few comments are as follow:\n1) On Page 1, the first and second paragraphs both contain \"symbol segmentation, symbol recognition and structural analysis\". It looks this framework is repeated again and again.\n2) In formula (4), the reviewer did not see the explanation of \"v_{att}^T\" and \"u_T\".\n3) Some references have only authors and title information, without conference/journal information.\n"}
