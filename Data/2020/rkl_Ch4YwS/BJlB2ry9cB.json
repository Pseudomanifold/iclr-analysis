The main approach uses the following stages, a detection stage that is based on YoloV3 and a sequence to sequence approach. The authors compare their method against Image2Latex approach (2016) that is an end to end pipeline and show that there is significant improvement compared to this approach. \n\nHowever, this problem has been a standard task and solved both in the handwritten math expression problem (CROHME challenge of ICDAR and typeset formula detection and recognition. There have been much progress through these challenges with various teams competing. A variety of approaches have been tried for this task and unfortunately the present work has not compared nor evaluated against these approaches. \n\nIm2Latex work is quite old benchmark and there have been numerous works as have been cited by the authors and more as can be available from the challenge. The methods presented are also not novel. Using Yolov3 for detection and sequence2sequence for parsing expressions are more or less standard approaches. Hence, the proposed work does not add a significant insight in solving the problem. "}
