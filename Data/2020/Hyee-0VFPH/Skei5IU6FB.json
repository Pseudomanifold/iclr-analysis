SGeO combines the advantages of both first-order algorithms and second-order algorithms. The authors provided two versions of SGeO for convex and nonconvex cases. Experiment results backup their theory.\n\nPros:\nThe writing of this paper is clear. The authors provided the new algorithm SGeO and showed some intuition behind this algorithm. The experiment results are convincing. \n\nCons:\n- The title of this paper overclaims. It seems that SGeO is a general optimization algorithm which does not utilize the properties of neural networks. Thus, I suggest the authors to revise the title and introduction part to emphasize that their algorithm works for general optimization problem. \n- The importance of this work is limited. First, there is no theoretical result for SGeO. Second, the authors do not compare their algorithm with previous baseline algorithms in detail. Thus, it is hard to convince me that this work is significant. I suggest the authors add theoretical analysis and detailed comparison with other geodesic optimization algorithm for both convex and nonconvex cases. \n- The explanation about the change from convex case to nonconvex case is not convincible enough.  I do not understand why it is necessary to make such a change from Algorithm 1 to Algorithm 2. The authors can make more comments in section 3.\n"}
