On the positive side, there are certainly differences in the design between this paper and SE, and the proposed block seems to be more lightweight than SE (although the cost for employing SE is tiny) .Moreover, the authors present a large number of experiments by applying their block to several different problems and architectures. \n\nHowever, on the negative side, I feel that the contribution is too incremental for ICLR, since the proposed block seems like more like a heavy engineered extension of SE. Moreover, comparison with SE is missing from many experiments. It is absolutely critical that SE numbers appear in all reported results."}
