They build their analysis on Saxe et.al.s work. They show that curvature corrected methods preserve properties of SGD. They also show the disadvantages of layer restricted approximations. They show the importance of time scales in optimization. The paper looks to deep learning from a dynamical systems perspective and hence their experiments are fitting to this framework.\nI have checked the analysis and it seems solid. However, my only concerns it the use case. I would like to see such methods show difference in real world datasets. I believe this is a big missing part of the paper.\n"}
