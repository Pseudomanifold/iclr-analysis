As long as this parameter-tying is observed, the resultant feed-forward network is guaranteed to respect the equivariant properties of this data, meaning entity indexes can be permuted, and the output produced by the layer will be permuted in the correct manner. This results in a maximally expressive feed forward layer for this kind of data.\n\nThis is a very good paper and should be accepted. The approach is convincing, and provides a clear way forward for representing an important class of data. The paper is surprisingly well-written and comprehensible given the complexity of the math. I learned a lot from reading this paper.\n\nThe experiments are somewhat rudimentary, but they are perfectly adequate for a paper whose contribution is primarily methodological and theoretical.\n\nOne suggestion I have is that some of the details from the Appendix should be moved into the paper proper, most notably the details of the experiments in Appendix H."}
