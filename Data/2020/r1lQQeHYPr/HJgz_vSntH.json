It addresses two tasks, namely Semantic Goal Navigation (SGN) and Embodied Question Answering (EQA), using a simple synthetic environment. The paper compares against a few simple baselines and baselines adapted from models in each task.\n\nI would recommend for acceptance, as the experimental results show that the proposed approach successfully transfers knowledge across tasks.\n\nHowever, I would also like to note that the paper has a few drawbacks.\n\nFirst, the paper uses a new environment to evaluate the SGN and EQA task instead of the benchmark environments for these two tasks, making it difficult to compare performance to previous work. The environment in the paper is small (compared to e.g., House3D for EQA) and has a limited variety. Also, the paper only compares to relatively out-of-date approaches on EQA and SGN, instead of the state-of-the-art approaches on them.\n\nIn addition, the paper should also discuss its connections to other multi-task learning approaches in the related work section."}
