The paper concludes that the internal-consistency constraints do not improve models\u2019 generalization to novel items, but improve performance when agents are tested on roles they were not trained for. \n\nThe experiments support the above conclusions on the small datasets used in the experiments. The paper is in general well structured and is clear and easy to follow. \n\nThe contributions of the paper are rather incremental. The main methods are described in section 3.3, which employ a self-play objective,  use shared embedding, and include sysmetric encoding and decoding. The extension is new but does not contain enough content for the conference. I do not think this paper presents enough contributions. \n"}
