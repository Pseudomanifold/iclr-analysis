The paper introduces a framework called RISE which provides a unified framework for existing methods in the domain. The authors further propose DISE which generalizes RISE. Experiments on time series forecasting demonstrate improved performance.\n\n+ It is quite interesting that the unified framework RISE can encompass the existing missing value imputation methods as special cases.\n+ The idea of using learnable factors for relative and absolute time information in DISE makes sense.\n\n- The alternative notations for the proposed framework and the existing framework are very confusing. It is not clear why such alternative notations for the same setting are necessary.\n- The modeling novelty is quite limited. Other than learnable factors for absolute and relative time information, there is very little motivation or theory regarding the modeling choice.\n- The experiments are not well motivated. The paper compares with a lot of missing value imputation baselines but the experimental setup is actually for extrapolation. In this case, a more proper set of baselines should be time series forecasting methods for irregularly sampled data such as Phased LSTM.\n"}
