Experiments show that the algorithm proposed by the author can exceed the performance of the benchmark algorithm.\n\nHowever, this paper has the following problems:\n1. The motivation for this article is unclear. Why does the presentation of headmaster critic enable more efficient communication between agents?\n2. The first paragraph of Section 3.2 of the article indicates that the proposed algorithm can learn how to group agents and when the agents communicate. Why do they need to be grouped? What does communication mean? What is the content of the communication? Section 3.2.1 indicates that agents are randomly grouped, so why to say that this grouping is learned?\n3. Section 3.2.1, what the difference between random groupings with those obtained through learning (like ATOC)? What are the advantages?\n4. Why did the headmaster critic learned in Section 3.2.1 not appear in the subsequent parts of the algorithm? Specifically, which part of the algorithm is used in it?\n5. Why is Equation 14 defined as such? What is its physical meaning? Why are the two terms before and after the plus sign the same but need to be multiplied by two different coefficients?\n6. The definitions of all loss functions in the paper, as well as the definition of Q-value functions, all use the same symbols. How to distinguish their specific meanings?\n7. What are the specific definitions of the state space, action space, and reward function for the three simulation environments used in the experimental section?\n8. There is too little content in the experimental part. There is no further experimental analysis for the motivation of the paper.\n9. It is too rough in content organization, there is no overall algorithm framework, and there is no algorithm pseudo code, which makes the understanding of this paper extremely difficult.\n10. This article refers extensively to communication between agents, but the relevant work section mentions little about communication-learning-based works.\n11. There are a lot of spelling and grammatical errors in the text, as well as formatting irregularities."}
