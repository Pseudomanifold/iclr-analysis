To achieve this, the proposed FoveaBox detector predicts category-sensitive semantic maps for the object existing possibility, and  produces category-agnostic bounding box for each position that is likely to contain an object. The scales of target boxes are associated with feature pyramid representations. Experiments are performed on MS COCO detection benchmark.\n\nPros:\nThe proposed approach is simple and is shown to avoid most computation and hyper-parameters related to anchor boxes. The paper is well written and easy to follow. \nCons:\nThe main issue with the paper is the main idea is similar to [1,2, 3, 4, 5]. For instance, CenterNet also represents each object instance by its features at the center point and achieves similar detection performance compared to the proposed detector. Further, no speed comparison with these approaches is provided in the paper. Without a fair speed comparison and with similar detection performance, it is difficult to fully assess the merits of the proposed approach. Though inference speed comparison is reported with RetineNet. However, a proper and detailed comparison with [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] is missing. \n\n1: Xingyi Zhou, Dequan Wang, Philipp Kr\u00e4henb\u00fchl: Objects as Points.
