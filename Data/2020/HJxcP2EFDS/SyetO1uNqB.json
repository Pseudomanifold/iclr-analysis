The algorithmic contribution is demonstrated in a Amharic dataset.\n\nMy rating for this paper is Reject because there is no novelty in the approach, it introduces some rules to build a FSA plus a logistic regression model with character-level ngram feature. It is also lack of argument/motivation why the proposed model is special and specific to the problem. The experiment only compares with two baselines in single dataset, which is also not convincing.\n"}
