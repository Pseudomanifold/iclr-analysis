The theoretical results in section 3 state the existence of the QCNN satisfying certain conditions. The QCNN is given by sections 4 and 5, with empirical evaluates in section 6. This subject is out of my usual area. However, I tend to think this subject is interesting to the ICLR audience due to the recent advancement in quantum computing.\n\ntitle, remove \"conference submissions\"\n\nSection 2, introduce QRAM.\n\nSomewhere around section 2-3, and in section 6, it has to be mentioned whether the proposed QCNN requires special hardware, and what is the hardware, and why it is required.\n\nNote the cited Cong et al. (2018) has been published in nature physics. As you both used the term \"QCNN\", it is better to explain more clearly what is the main difference in the main text."}
