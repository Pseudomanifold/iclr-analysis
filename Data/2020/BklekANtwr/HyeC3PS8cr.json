Neither a new method nor an in-depth investigation of the task itself is carried out. It is hard to identify contributions that are significant enough to support the publication in top conferences such as ICLR. Considering the fact that autoencoder LSTM is wildly employed in solving various unsupervised learning tasks, readers can hardly acquire knowledge in terms of novelty."}
