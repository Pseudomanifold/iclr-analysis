The core model is a video prediction model (Srivastava et al. 2015). Instead of using the original 3D geometry, the authors propose to predict a feature representation based on prior work (Brezis & Gomez-Castro 2017, Bohn et al. 2013, Teran & Garcke 2019).\n\nStrength:\n + Interesting problem\n + Good writing\nAreas of improvement:\n - Technical contribution\n - Experiments\n\nThe paper is quite easy to read, although it would help to clearly separate prior work from the actual technical contributions. The problem of simulating 3D meshes instead of raw pixels is interesting.\n\nMy main issue with the paper was that I had a hard time seeing a contribution. It is unclear what is technically new, or if everything was just copied from prior work. It was also unclear which parts of the technical approach mattered? Is the LSTM the right solution, or are there other simple baselines to compare to?\n\nFinally, the experiments are not very intuitive. It is unclear what impact the presented technique has on the down-stream tasks of crash testing. Does it improve the current simulation of crash testing? Is the prediction error acceptable to replace certain safety tests?"}
