Such structural deformation sequences are collected from a simulation and used to train and evaluate the model. \n\nStrengths.\n1. Deep neural network architecture is applied to learn a 3D mesh structure deformation. Its approach looks reasonable to me -- (i) a high-level (user-specified) feature is extracted to represent 3D structural mesh, and (ii) LSTMs are trained in this feature space. \n\n2. The paper shows that LSTM can learn the underlying dynamics of 3D structural deformation (but since it does not provide any comparison with other work, I cannot determine the prediction error is within a reasonable bound for this task).\n\nWeaknesses.\n1. Weak technical and theoretical novelty.\nAn existing LSTM-based seq-to-seq style architecture is simply chosen and applied to the 3D mesh reconstruction and prediction task. LSTM networks have been successfully applied to various tasks, thus it would be less impactful even if a paper shows LSTM works well in the specific task. \n\n2. Missing comparison with existing work.\n(As far as I know) the task of predicting 3D structure deformation has long been studied and various simulation and analysis tools have widely used in academia and industries. The paper, however, does not thoroughly compare or cite any prior work in this area. As a reader from a different area, I would like to see more thorough analysis to support (i) what are the main bottlenecks of the conventional approaches, (ii) how the proposed data-driven approach can help to address these issues, and (iii) how the proposed approach can further extend.\n\nFor example, the paper mentions (as the main reason to use the deep neural network) that \u201cSince one simulation run takes a couple of hours on a compute cluster, running a large number of simulation is not feasible\u201d (in the 1st paragraph of Introduction). Can the authors provide an analysis of flops (floating-point operations per second)?\n\n3. Simulated data for training. \n205 samples are collected from a simulation to train and validate the proposed model and half an hour has taken to train this model. Judging from the common practices, does this imply the underlying dynamics function (of a simulation) is trivial to learn? \n\nAlso, only two parts (i.e. the left and right structural beam) of the whole 3D structure are analyzed. This implies that relations between any other parts are not considered and only a sole part is individually analyzed.\n\nMinor concerns.\n- Typo (In Figure 1 caption, \u2018undo\u2019).\n- \u201cDue to the encoder having 1000 layers\u201d?\n- Labels are needed in Figures."}
