The related work section mentions some obvious points of comparison (note: see also https://science.sciencemag.org/content/364/6443/859.abstract). However, the authors do not compare with ANY of this work (either in terms of algorithm design or performance). It is therefore difficult to evaluate the contribution. \n\nIn more detail, the paper combines RL, multi-agent learning and evolution. This is an extremely challenging domain, with many moving parts. How does this approach relate to the work of Salimans et al, Jaderberg et al, Houthooft et al, etc? Without detailed discussion and experiments it is impossible to tell if this is an advance. Improving on the baselines is a useful sanity check. Showing the work is an actual contribution requires comparing against other algorithms in the same space. \n"}
