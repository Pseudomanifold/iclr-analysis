The results show that (c- \u03f5)-transform and c-transform give more estimation of the Wasserstein distances than the gradient penalty and weight clipping methods in the given experiments, but the gradient penalty method produces more compelling samples in the generative setting.\n\nThe paper is well written and the experiment section is extensive. However, it is more like an extended experiment report to me which is very valuable but lacks sufficient technical novelty expected at ICLR.\n\nAnother comment is that when the authors mentioned \"... are compared to ground truth values d_ground computed by POT\", there needs more explanations on what that library actually does to compute the Wasserstein distance to make the paper self-contained, e.g. what exact algorithms it uses as there are also dozens of different algorithms implemented in that library.\n\nIn Section 3.1, the authors state that \"it tends to converge within couple of iterations of the symmetric Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm. For efficiency, we approximate these terms with one Sinkhorn-Knopp iteration\". What is the extent of sacrifice in accuracy due to this approximation? The authors should provide more evidences to justify the approximation."}
