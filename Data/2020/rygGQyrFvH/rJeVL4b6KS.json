To this end, the authors provide a deep analysis of the most common decoding methods, and propose Nucleus Sampling, a very simple yet effective method to generate higher-quality text. Compared with top-k sampling, the key idea behind the proposed method is to sample from the dynamic nucleus of tokens containing the majority of the probability mass. Experiments demonstrate that nucleus sampling is an effective decoding strategy in practice. \n\nStrengths:\n\n(1) Writing & Clarity: The proposed method is well motivated, the paper is carefully written, and clearly presented. I enjoyed reading the paper.  \n\n(2) Experiments: The experiments are also carefully designed. Both quantitative and human evaluation are provided. Quality examples are also shown. \n\nWeaknesses:\n\n(1) Novelty: The biggest concern that I have is its technical novelty. The proposed method is effective, but it acts more like a useful trick. Also, no theoretical justification is provided, but only some intuitions. So, I would say the novelty is indeed limited. However, given the comprehensive evaluation, and high writing quality, I lean to accept this paper due to its empirical contribution. It seems that this nucleus sampling method can be applied in a wide range of text generation applications.  \n\n\n** Minor **\nTypo: In the line below Eqn.
