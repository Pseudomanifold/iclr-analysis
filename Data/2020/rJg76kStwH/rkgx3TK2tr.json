This system is able to perform inference and learning the weights of the logic formulas.\n\nThe proposed approach seems valid and really intriguing. Moreover the problems it tackles, i.e. inference and learning over big knowledge graphs, are of foremost importance and are interesting for a wide community of researchers.\nI have just one concern and it is about the experiments for the knowledge graph completion task. In fact, this task was performed only on one KG. I think the proposed system should be evaluated on more KGs.\n\nFor these reasons I think the paper, after an extension of the experimental results, should be accepted.\n\n[Minor]\nPage 3. \u201cThe equality holds\u201d which equality are you talking about?\n"}
