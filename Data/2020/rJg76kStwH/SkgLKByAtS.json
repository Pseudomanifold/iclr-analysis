Graph neural networks are used for learning representations for Knowledge graphs and are quite scalable when it comes to probabilistic inference. But no prior rules can be incorporated and it requires significant amount of examples per target in order to converge. On the other hand, MLN are quite powerful for logical reasoning and dealing with noisy data but its inference process is computationally intensive and does not scale. Combining these two frameworks seem to result in a powerful framework which generalizes well to new knowledge graphs, does inference and is able to scale to large entities. \n\nRegarding its contribution, the paper seems to consider a training process which is done using the variational EM algorithm. The variational EM is used to optimize the ELBO term (motivation for this is the intractability of the computing the partition term). In the E-step, they infer the posterior distribution and in the M-step they learn the weights. The integration of variational EM algorithm and MLN has been explored in another work (pLogicNet: Probabilistic Logic Neural Networks for Reasoning), but this paper proposes a new pipeline of tools: MLN, GNN and variational EM which seem to outperform all the existing baseline methods.The paper looks technically sound to me and the evaluations results are delivered neatly, however the flow of the paper makes it a bit difficult to follow sometimes due to many topics covered in it.\nRegarding the significance of the paper, it tries to combine logic reasoning and probabilistic inference which is of great interest among the researchers recently. ExpressGNN proves to generalise well and perform accurate inference due to the tunable embeddings added at the GNN.\n\nOverall, the work of this paper seems technically sound but I don\u2019t find the contributions particularly surprising or novel. Along with plogicnet, there have been many extensions and applications of Gnns, and I didn\u2019t find that the paper expands this perspective in any surprising way. \n"}
