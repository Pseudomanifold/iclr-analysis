To address the limitations of current deep learning-based approaches, the authors propose a probabilistic deep learning model with a novel loss function, Bingham loss, to predict uncertain orientations. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.\n\nThis paper is well-motivated and the proposed method addresses important problems in uncertain orientation prediction. The paper is well-supported by theoretical analysis, however, the empirical analysis is a little weak and the model does not consider multimodal cases. For the above reasons, I tend to accept this paper but wouldn't mind rejecting it. \n\nQuestions: \n1. You only compared with one baseline. How does the model compare with a loss that is not based on directional statistics or Gaussian models?\n2. How can you improve the model for multimodal cases?"}
