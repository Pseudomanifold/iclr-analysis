This distribution has the necessary characteristics required to represent orientation uncertainty using quaternions (one way to represent object orientation in 3D) such as antipodal symmetry. The authors propose various additions such as using precomputed lookup tables to represent a simplified version of the normalization constant (to make it computationally tractable), and the use of Expected Absolute Angular Deviation (EAAD) to make the uncertainty of the Bingham distribution more interpretable. \n\n+Uncertainty quantification of neural networks is an important problem that I believe should gain more attention so I am happy to see papers such as this one. \n+Various experiments on multiple datasets show the efficacy of the method as well as out performing or showing comparable results to state-of-the-art\n\n-In the caption for Table 1 the author\u2019s write: \u201cthe high likelihood and lower difference between EAAD and MAAD indicate that the Bingham loss better captures the underlying noise.\u201d How much difference between EAAD and MAAD is considered significant and why?\n\n-In section 4.5 they write \u201cWhile Von Mises performs better on the MAAD, we observe that there is a larger difference between the MAAD and EAAD values for the Von Mises distribution than the Bingham distribution. This indicates that the uncertainty estimates of the Von Mises distribution may be overconfident.\u201d Same question as above. What amount of difference between MAAD and EAAD is considered significant and why?\n"}
