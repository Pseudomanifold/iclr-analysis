It builds on  DCFR but  computes average strategy from value network buffer and the results show that SD-CFR is better than DCFR in practice.\n\n\nThis paper is similar to DCFR in terms of , and the written should be improved. For example, the notion of  Leduc poker in section B  is not consistent with section 6.1.\n\n\nMy major concern is that the experiment is done a small action space poker game, which limits the contribution. How about the performance of SD-CFR in the unlimited version which has more actions and the game size is controllable that can compute the exploitability? Furthermore, the experiment should be conducted more thoroughly. For example, to test the robustness??, apply another network architectures instead of using the DCFR version; verify the network has generalization across info sets instead of just remember the value of each Infoset; evaluate the influence of one-hot encodings of cards rather than just the embeddings chosen in the experiment.\n", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I assessed the sensibility of the derivations and theory."}
