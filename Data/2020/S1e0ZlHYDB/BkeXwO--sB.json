This is a well written paper that includes all the required background and related works, as well as an easy-to-understand example that runs through the manuscript, explaining what the reader needs to know in order to appreciate the work. The empirical results of several experiments show that the PCR requires up to two times less storage bandwidth while retaining model accuracy.\n\nMy only concern is that although the related work section provides a thorough survey of the current methods in the literature, the authors did not demonstrate the performance of state-of-the-art and compare their performance with them. I believe this is necessary to truly validate the superiority of their method over state-of-the-art.\n", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "N/A"}
