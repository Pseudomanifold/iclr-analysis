They have proposed a method to learn an unsupervised few-shot learner via self-supervised training (UFLST), which consists of two alternate processes, progressive clustering and episodic training. Experimental results on several benchmark data sets validate the effectiveness. Overall, I think it is an interesting scenario and have the following comments.\n(1) The first one the about the method. The authors have tried to describe their methods in a concrete way. Nevertheless, it is better to give some justifications from the theoretical aspect. It is vital for readers to convince the superiority.\n(2) The second one is about the description. I suggest the authors to express as accurately as possible. For example, in the abstract, the authors state that \u2018However, current few-shot learners are mostly supervised and rely heavily on a large amount of labeled examples.\u2019 I do not agree with this statement since in few shot learning, there are only limited exemplars. There is a conflict between them and it will confuse the readers."}
