Its isomorphism invariance, expressiveness and deformation consistency is analyzed. Based on graph perturbation, the representation capacity of GLS is analyzed; bounds are derived for the distance between the GLS of two graphs; lastly experiments are conducted on multiple datasets to validate the proposed graph representation. \n\nAfter reading the paper, my biggest concern lies in the fact that the proposed graph representation does not outperform the existing approaches, especially on the social network datasets. \n\nFor easier reading,  it is better to mark the best performers in the results tables in bold or color.\n\nMinor:\nThe paper needs proofreading, below please find some of the typos:\n2nd sentence in the 2nd paragraph, corresponding difference -> corresponding to\n4th sentence in Sec 4.2, pad -> padded\n1st sentence in the 3rd paragraph in Sec. 5.1 w -> we?\n3rd sentence in the 3rd paragraph in Sec. 5.1 avoid -> avoids"}
