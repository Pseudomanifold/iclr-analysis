This representation can be used to compare graphs, and classify them. The authors prove that structural similarity is reflected by the similarity in their GLS.  I propose rejection of this paper for the following reasons: \n- The idea of using the spectrum for defining graph similarity is definitely not novel. See the tutorial \"Node    Similarity,    Graph    Similarity    and    Matching:        Theory    and    Applications\".\n- The claim that structural similarity (especially cut similarity) is reflected on the Laplacian spectrum is known. \n- This paper misses important literature, and actually many papers on graph similarity. E.g., \"Least-squares estimation of transformation parameters between two point patterns\" by Umeyama. Since then a lot of work has followed up on the topic. A beautiful work related to this was published recently by Kolla et al \"Spectrally Robust Graph Isomorphism\" \n- The paper is not well-written. Besides the existence of typos (E.g., Rnyi is R\\'{e}nyi), some parts can become shorter since they are standard.\n- Isomorphism on random binomial graphs is known to be an easy (i.e., in P) problem. I understand that it stands as a sanity check, but a more interesting sanity check would be great. Overall the experiments are not convincing. \n"}
