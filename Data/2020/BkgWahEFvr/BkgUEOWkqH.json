The motivation is based on the observation: the distribution of the soft-max for the cleaned image and its transformed images for one class is similar to the distribution of the soft-max for the adversarial image and its transformed images for the same class, and the distributions of the soft-max for the cleaned image and its transformed images for different classes are different. Then, a distribution based method is proposed to classify the distribution of the soft-max for the cleaned (or adversarial) image and its transformed images. \n\nAfter I read the core part several times, finally I understood the paper. Overall I think this paper is well motivated, and the empirical results also support the claims/observations. But I think this paper could be improved by (1) checking the performance over large datasets (such as ImageNet); (2) providing possible analysis on the observation. Otherwise, the readers cannot be fully convinced. "}
