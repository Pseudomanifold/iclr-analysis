It does that by using the Bayesian framework of filtering, which shows that if sufficient statistics given the observations so far can be computed at each stage of filtering, then the expected hidden states at each stage can be estimated as well. The paper then follows this framework by constructing deep neural network mapping from \u201cobservations so-far\u201d to \u201csufficient statistics\u201d and by universal approximation theorem this is possible. Then as long as after each stage, the image of such a mapping is bounded into a certain region, and if the mapping is contractive (|C_\\psi C_\\phi| < 1), this can be applied to arbitrarily long sequence (and thus infinite horizon). \n\nThe paper is well-written and easy to follow. However, I have concerns about its novelty. Overall the paper seems to be a straightforward application of universal approximation theorem of deep neural network. The authors don\u2019t specify when the condition will hold (e.g., |C_\\psi C_\\phi| < 1), what kind of empirical RNNs fall into this category and whether the trained models are operating in the contractive region. \n\nAlso with the same technique the authors also reach the same conclusion for nonlinear dynamics system (Sec. 4.2). From the proof, there is no much difference between linear case (Kalman Filter) and nonlinear case, since apparently DNN can fit everything. Then what are the new discoveries and takeaway messages? It is not clear what can we learn from this analysis and its impact is likely to be limited. "}
