More specifically, the paper provides a theoretical analysis on the approximation error for any stochastic dynamic system with noisy sequential observations.\n\nI find the work interesting. Yet, I don't understand how it substantially deviates from previous work. The cited work by Schafer&Zimmermann only considers deterministic systems -- but what is the distinguishing idea of your paper that makes your more general analysis possible? To me it seems utilizing sufficient statistics? But working with sufficient statistics resembles lossly again working with a deterministic-like abstraction? While I understand that this a purely theoretical work, it would be instructive to have practical demonstrations, showing what's happening when learning is actually done. Finally, interpreting RNNs as bayesian filters was utilized in recent works, e.g. Recurrent Neural Filters.\n\nAs a side note, isn't eq.3 called the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation. Also, the book by Jazwinski is often cited -- I think if the main findings utilized in your text, e.g. the proof of Thm1, were replicated in the Appendix, your paper would feel more complete."}
