Experiment results are demonstrated in Section 5.\n\nThe paper is well written in general, and the proposed algorithm is also interesting. However, I think the paper suffers from the following limitations:\n\n1) This paper does not have any theoretical analysis or justification. It would be much better if the authors can rigorously prove the advantages of BRPO under some simplifying assumptions.\n\n2) It would be better if the authors can provide more experiment results, like experiment results in more games."}
