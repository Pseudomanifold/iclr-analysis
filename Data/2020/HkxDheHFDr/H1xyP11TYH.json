The paper is in general well written and presents a large number of visual images demonstrating that the approach works. The main concerns with the paper are as follows:\n\n1) The implementation details for the work are relegated to an appendix. As this is a core concept for the work one would expect this to be presented in the main body of the work.\n\n2) Although there are a large number of visual images there is little in the way of analytical analysis of the work. As a particular concern the authors claim that figure 3 \u2018prove\u2019 that objects are disentangled. From Maths 101 I remember it being drummed into us that \u2018proof by example is not a proof\u2019.\n\n3) The are parts of the process which are not explained for example, why is the following conducted? \u2018The digits are first rescaled from their original size (28 \u00d7 28) to 15 \u00d7 15 by bilinear interpolation, and finally binarized by rounding.\u2019\n\n4) I would also like to know why this is called disentangling as the whole process prevents the \u2018icons\u2019 from overlapping. Disentangle normally refers to things which are at least overlapping. There are examples of works in this area.\n\n5) The example cases are simple. One would expect at least one real-world example."}
