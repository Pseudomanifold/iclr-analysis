The work presents impressive qualitative results which shows the practical use of the proposal on multi-mnist and multi-dSprites. \n\nWhile the use of inference networks proposing positions for the network as a means of improving the disentanglement is clever and seems novel, though not unlike inference sub-networks which are well-known in conditional generation, the evaluation is not up to a standard I can endorse, resulting in a recommendation to reject. \n\nDespite the interesting qualitative results, I will have to quote the work in saying, \u201cAll methods cited here are likelihood based so they can and should be compared in terms of test log likelihood. We leave this for future work.\u201d.  Indeed the cited works should have been evaluated against, especially Greff et al. 2019, Nash et al, 2017, and Eslami et al, 2016, which are all very similar.  As written it\u2019s impossible to tell whether this work actually improves over the state of the art, we only have the constructed baseline (which as a community we all know clearly would not have worked). \n\nA figure showing the relevant submodules of the network architecture and what they do in relation to the overall method would be helpful to understand the pipeline and how the inference network relates to the whole.\n"}
