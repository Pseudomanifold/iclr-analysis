The employed features in Table 3 are handcrafted.\n- The task (simulating human postural control) is not well-situated in the context of prior work using HiBO for robotics, so the contribution remains unclear.\n- It is not clear why this problem should be formulated as contextual policy search (i.e., to what the context variable refers).\n- Only one baseline (Bayesian optimization (BO)) is reported. This baseline corresponds to the ablation of the HiBO method (i.e., the omission of the context variable), and so does not represent, more broadly, an alternative approach.\n- The concept of \"mental replay\" is briefly introduced, but no reference is made to prior work in imagined rollouts, and no ablation study on the impact of this component is performed.\n\nMinor points:\n- It is unclear why the problem setting should be labeled as \"psychological\" postural control.\n- There are several missing references (\"?\") in the text."}
