The model, named sequential residual VAE (SR-VAE), gradually activates individual latent variables to reconstruct residuals. Quantitative and qualitative experiments show that the proposed model outperforms beta-VAE and Factor-VAE.  Since the training involves a sequence of model training,  SR-VAE certainly consumes more time than other VAEs. Minors: citations in the main text should be put in brackets. "}
