But the authors fail to discuss the relationship and difference with this paper.\nAlso, the best paper from ICML 2019 claimed that unsupervised learning method can not really disentangle the features. They claim \\beta-VAE, factor VAE is not good. The authors shall all discuess this point. Otherwise, it is not convincing to the readers.\n\n"}
