The authors come up with an estimator of the gradient for the generator from the gradient of the discriminator, which was disconnected previously. With this change, the model should be able to  select better tokens than random selection, which could leads to more robust training. The experiment results on both COCO Image Captions and EMNLP 2017 News datasets justify the authors' argument. "}
