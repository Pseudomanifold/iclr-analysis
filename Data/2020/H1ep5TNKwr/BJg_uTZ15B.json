The authors employ the Hebbian learning concept iteratively using the pre-calculated transition probability. They evaluate their model on six benchmark datasets.\n\n[Pros]\n- Very simple and fast by using an error-free update rule.\n\n[Cons]\n- The introduction is not organized. What are the motivation, related work, and contribution?\n- No comparison with conventional methods such as PageRank and NN-based models such as SEAL [1] and VGAE [2]. Even if this method is not learning-based, the proposed model should be compared.\n- The authors claimed they applied their model to real recommendation systems. But there is no specific information. At least, the author describes what is recommended, the data size, how large performance is improved, etc.\n- It is required to be evaluated on conventional datasets.\n- Ablation on sigma\n\n[1] M.
