It is based on a previous proposed method Flush+Reload that generates the raw trace of function calls. Then the authors applied several techniques to rebuild the computational graph from the raw traces. The proposed method is used to reconstruct MalConv which is a data pre-processing pipeline for malware detection and ProxyLessNas which is a network architecture obtained by NAS. \n\nOverall, the paper is well-written and easy to read. The problem of stealing machine learning pipelines/architectures is interesting and important, since it enables an attacker to actually know the private networks that are being used for prediction. Therefore, I think this is a promising direction for future work.\n\nI hope the authors can address my concerns as follows:\n\nQ1: What is the knowledge of the attacker? The authors should be explicit in summarizing the detailed search space of the attacker. Currently i found it very hard to understand the capability of attacker. This is important in evaluating this work.\n\nQ2: Can the authors add some discussion on how to defend against the proposed attack? For example, one can add some null/useless operation during execution to make the reconstruction process harder? \n\nQ3: I am curious why the authors choose ProxylessNAS-CPU for evaluation. There is a bunch of other architectures found by NAS, e.g. MNas, ENas?"}
