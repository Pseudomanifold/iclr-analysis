Results are presented in a way that gives the reader a good overview, but figure quality / legibility could be improved.\n\nORIGINALITY\nThe CEB method is an original (but minor) modification of a well known method. \n\nSIGNIFICANCE\nThe primary contribution of the paper is a thorough experimental evaluation of the particular regularization method presented in the paper. While this is certainly useful, it would have been even better with more comparison with other regularization methods. The paper clearly demonstrates the benefits of CEB, which is of interest in itself.\n\nFURTHER COMMENTS\nConsider making a more clear distinction between generalization and robustness.\n\"are are\" Double word.\n\"all machine-learned systems...highly vunerable\" Too strong statement.\n\"VIB\" Abbreviation not defined in the text.\nFigure 1, 2 and 3 are a bit hard to read (especially the dotted lines)\n\n"}
