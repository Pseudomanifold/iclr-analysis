Observing that the class of solutions (mappings) covered by those methods is very large, they propose to restrict the set of solutions by looking at low energy mappings (energy being defined wrt. a dedicated cost). A natural formulation of the associated problem is found in optimal transport (OT) theory. They examine the underlying problem in its dynamical formulation, for which a direct connection can be made with ResNet architecture that are commonly used in cycleGANs. They illustrate these results on simple examples, involving pairing swapped digits from MNIST and celebA male to female examples. As a matter of facts, results presented with the OT formulation are more constant. The main proposition of the paper is that the task at hand can be efficiently coded through the distance (cost) function of OT.\n\nOverall the paper is well written and the proposition is reasonable. Yet some parts seem unnecessary long to me, or bring little information, notably the formalisation of 2.1 and 2.2. The fact that cycleGANs are severely ill-posed problems is well known from the computer vision community. Variants that can include a few paired samples can be found (not exhaustive): \nTripathy, S., Kannala, J., & Rahtu, E. (2018, December). Learning image-to-image translation using paired and unpaired training samples. In Asian Conference on Computer Vision (pp. 51-66). Springer, Cham.\nOe that try to regularize the associated flow:\nDLOW: Domain Flow for Adaptation and Generalization Rui Gong, Wen Li, Yuhua Chen, Luc Van Gool; The IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2019, pp. 2477-2486\n\nIn this spirit, I wonder if a comparison with only the vanilla cycleGAN is sufficient to really assess the interest of using the OT formulation of the problem. Notably, in the example of digit swaps, a cost is learnt by finding a representation of the digits that eliminates the importance of position in the representation. Training such a classifier assumes having some labelled data, that could theoretically be paired, and thus making amenable variants of cycleGans that use a few paired samples. In this sense, I think that the paper fails in giving convincing arguments that advocate the use of OT here. As the dynamical formulation is known and already used to learn mappings (  see Trigila, G., & Tabak, E. G. (2016). Data\u2010driven optimal transport. Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics, 69(4), 613-648. For instance). Also variants of OT that estimate a Monge mapping could have been included (e.g. V. Seguy, B. B. Damodaran, R. Flamary, N. Courty, A. Rolet, M. Blondel, Large-Scale Optimal Transport and Mapping Estimation, International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2018.)\n\nAs a summary:\nPros:\nA nice interpretation of CycleGAN with OT\nThe paper is fairly well written\nCons: \nOverall the quantity of novelties is, in the eyes of the reviewer, somehow limited. At least the contributions should be clarified;\nThe experimental section is not convincing in explaining why the OT formulation is better than variants of cycleGAN or also other schemes for computing OT than the dynamical formulation\n\nMinor remark:\nA reference to Benamou, Brenier 2000 could have been given regarding section 3.2 and the dynamical formulation of OT. \n"}
