Basically, the authors only compare results with seqGAN and leakGAN. MaliGAN (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.07983.pdf), TextGAN (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03850.pdf), etc. \nAlso, KL + reversed KL training method for GAN framework is first proposed in Symmetric VAE (https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.01846), and the Proposition 2 basically are the same as the Symmetric VAE paper.\n\nTherefore, I think this work is lack of novelty, and still need more time to work on."}
