It uses a graph-based formulation to view the problem, and proposes to perform input-dependent sampling and learn input-dependent weights and affinities for message passing. \n\nPros:\n1. The proposed method is clearly introduced\n2. The differences between the proposed method and related work are clearly explained and demonstrated through ablation study.\n3. The visualization in Figure 4 backups the authors' claims.\n\nCons:\n1. It is not clear why the graph-based formulation is better, making it hard to compare the proposed method with (Jia et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2019). More details should be provided.\n2. The results of Non-local (Wang et al., 2018) in Table 2 is not consistent with the original paper.\n3. In all experiments, is the training setting the same for all the models involved?"}
