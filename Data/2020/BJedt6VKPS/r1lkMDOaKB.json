The initialization considers fan-in and fan-out, to regularize the range of singular values of the Hessian matrix, under several assumptions.\n\nThe proposed approach gives important insights for the problem of weight initialization in neural networks. Overall, the method makes sense. However, I have several concerns:\n\n- The authors do not consider more recent neural network designs such as normalization layers, skip connections, etc. It would be great if the authors could discuss how these layers would change the derivation of the initialization method. Also, preliminary experimental results using these layers are needed. Additionally, to me, normalization layers [Huang et al. Decorrelated Batch Normalization. CVPR 2018] implicitly precondition the Hessian matrix as well. It would be great if the authors also compare their approach to [Huang et al. 2018].\n\n- The authors compared to other initialization schemes such as [He et al., 2015] and [ Glorot and Bengio 2010]. But as the authors mentioned, there are approaches that scales backpropagation gradients also [Martens and Grosse, 2015; Grosse and Martens, 2016; Ba et al., 2017; George et al., 2018]. Since these methods are highly related to the proposed method, it would be great if the authors could show time complexities and performance differences of these methods as well.\n\n- Experiments on the CIFAR-10 dataset with AlexNet seem not exciting: the proposed Preconditioned approach only outperforms the Fan-out approach marginally. I would say that training a [He et al. 2015]-initialized neural network for 500 more iterations than a preconditioned neural network, yields a similar or better loss.\n\nOverall I think the work is very important and interesting. However, it lacks comprehensive comparison and consideration of more recent neural network layers."}
