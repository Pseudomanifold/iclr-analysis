That said, I am all in for simple and efficient solutions so I am giving this paper a weak accept for now.\n\nThere is not much to ask here (unless I say I want to see how this would work on other backbones and problems). nevertheless, to improve this work, I think the authors need to compare which solution (referring to algorithms in Table1, 2 etc.) is faster/more well-behaved given the combo explained at the bottom of page 5 . This is basically my question/request for the rebuttal.  "}
