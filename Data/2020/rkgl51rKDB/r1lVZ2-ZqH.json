The idea is that high-level plans transfer across settings (e.g. picking up a mug), while low-level execution may differ across tasks (e.g. different robot morphologies). To this end, the approach meta-learns a two-level hierarchical policy. The higher level policy conditions on a latent task context to produce high-level actions, or goals for the lower level policy. The lower level policy is trained via HER to reach these goals (it may need to be completely re-trained at test time). \n\nConcerns and Questions\nI am very concerned about the experimental results. I do not think that these tasks require hierarchy to solve, as the exact same tasks (with the same simulated robot) were solved in Hindsight Experience Replay, Andrychowicz al. 2017. Thus HER (preferably implemented with SAC rather than DDPG for fair comparison) is a vital baseline that is missing from Figure 3. Could the authors please address this point?\nWhile the introduction and Section 4 claim that one important benefit of such a hierarchical approach is that one could transfer to more disparate tasks, there are no experiments supporting this idea. I think the addition of these experiments would greatly strengthen the paper.\nIn Figure 3, does \u201cPEARL with sparse reward\u201d refer to only the encoder receiving sparse rewards or also the actor-critic?\n\nWriting suggestions\nA suggestion about the title: consider including the word \u201chierarchical\u201d \nIn some places the writing is quite informal, I suggest revising it (in the intro: \u201cDRL barely works\u201d.\nI disagree with the sentence in the intro \u201cIntuitively this is quite similar to how a human behaves\u201d, which is said in support of the idea of transferring high-level goals instead of low-level execution. Human behavior also supports the opposite view - that we reuse primitive motions over and over in support of new goals. So I think it\u2019s best to avoid the appeal to human behavior here (as well as in related work).\nThe first paragraph of section 4.2 is redundant and can be removed, or at least moved to the beginning of Section 4.\n\nIn conclusion, my current impression is that while the idea is interesting, the results achieve the same performance as a non-hierarchical method, which is not included as a baseline.\n"}
