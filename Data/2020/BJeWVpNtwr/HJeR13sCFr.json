Through a series of experiments with three standard CNN models (ResNet, VGG11, MobileNetV2), the authors demonstrated that lower precision value can be better than high precision values in term of Pareto efficiency under the iso-model size scenario. They also study cases with and without depth-wise convolution, and propose a new quantization method, DualPrecision. DualPrecision empirically outperformed 8-bit quantization and flexible quantization methods on ImageNet.\n\nComment:\nI am not at all familiar with quantization methods, therefore no knowledge of relevant related works. If, however, the authors did a thorough job of surveying related works and chose sensible baselines, I think the experiments demonstrate the usefulness of the new DualPrecision technique."}
