The core idea is adaptive instance normalization (Huang & Belongie, 2017). \n\nDetailed comments:\n\nThere are many typos and wrong notations in the text. Here is an incomplete list:\n- \"it were spoken by target speaker\", should be \"was\". \n- In Section 3.1, \"Here, U_1 and U_2 are spoken by Z_i and Z_2\" should Z_1. Overall, the descriptions in this subsection is confusing. For example, it seems utterance U_i is from speaker Z_i in the dataset, but there are n speakers and m utterances.\n\n- A closely related task is voice cloning, which is arguably more challenging than voice conversion, because the synthesis need generalize to arbitrary text. One may properly discuss the recent advances in this community (e.g., Arik et al., 2018; Nachmani et al., 2018; Jia et al., 2018).\n\nPros:\nThe empirical improvement seems meaningful.\n\nCons:\nThis paper is poorly written and difficult to follow. For example, I could not accurately identify the major contribution & novelty after reading the abstract and introduction. As an application paper, the authors may clearly explain the ideas with a few sentences in the most natural way without \"heavy notations\", e.g., Eq. (5)(6)(7)."}
