Convergence analysis is carefully provided to show that ZO-MIN-MAX converges to a neighborhood of stationary points. Then, the authors empirically compare several methods on \n1) adversarial attack on ImageNet with deep networks, and \n2) black-box poisoning attack on logistic regression. The results show that ZO-MIN-MAX can provide satisfactory performance on these tasks.\n\nIn general a good paper with dense content, clear organization and writing. However, the experiment part does not seem truly convincing. \n1.\tWhat is the relationship between Eqn.(13) and the proposed ZO-MIN-MAX? It seem that in the experiment you compare using this loss ( Eqn.(13) ) against finite-sum loss, but both with ZO-MIN-MAX algorithm? In figure 1 and 2, I don\u2019t see a competing method. So the point here is that the loss Eqn.(13)  is better, but not the proposed algorithm? I think you should compare different optimization algorithm under same loss, e.g. something like Eqn.(13)+ZO-MIN-MAX vs. Eqn.(13)+FO-MIN-MAX. This is not evident to show that ZO-MIN-MAX is better than other zero-th order methods.\n2.\tI would suggest comparing to more zeroth-order methods in the experiment.\n\nFrom the experiments I cannot tell whether ZO-MIN-MAX is good enough compared with other methods"}
