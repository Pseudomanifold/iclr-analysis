This submission is a clearly unfinished one. The two biggest problems are as follows\n\n1. Lack of a comprehensive discussion on rules for sampling section, please see \"Automated Curriculum Learning for Neural Networks\". Why previous methods are worse than the proposed one is not clear.\n\n2. All experiments are only compared with baseline approaches. In some experiments, the improvements are really marginal (e.g., Figure 2). In these cases, the STD of these curves is not shown, it is not clear whether the improvements are significant or not."}
