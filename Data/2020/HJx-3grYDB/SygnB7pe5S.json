The main idea is to have local (agent specific) value function and one global value function (for all agents). They also try minimizing the required communication need for multi-agent setup. To this end they deploy variational inference tools and support their method with an experimental study.\n\nI found the paper interesting and empirical evaluation is good. However, my knowledge in the field is quite limited.\n"}
