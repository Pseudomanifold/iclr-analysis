There are two findings in this paper: one is that the textures of fake faces are substantially different from real ones, another is that global image texture information is more robust to image editing and generalizable. Based on these two findings, the Gram-Net was proposed to improve the model, whose backbone is Resnet-18, to make the model more generalizable for image editing, down sampling, JPEG compression, blur and noise.\n\nHowever, there are some weaknesses: \n1) there are some logic problems about the paper. At the page 5, the section 5.1 points out that the strong correlation in larger texture shown more robust to image editing. As we known the image always exist large noises, However, the paper used the Pearson Correlation Coefficient to evaluate the correlation, in the large noise situation, it is not proper for the evaluation of correlation between edited and original images. \n2) the paper conducted abundant experiments on the Resnet-18 backbone, it not sufficient to prove the idea is work on all backbone. \n    \nMinor comments:\nFigure 3 should have the same part of face of real and fake images and be more persuasion.\n"}
