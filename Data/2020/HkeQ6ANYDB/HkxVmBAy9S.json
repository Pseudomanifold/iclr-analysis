While existing work seem\nto incorporate such information via one of 4 standard ways (given on page 2), the proposed work\nattempts to meld them so as to find the optimal combination for the problem at hand and the data\navailable.\n\nWhile I don't see anything fundamentally wrong with the paper, I do not feel that the technical\ncontributions are substantial enough to warrant acceptance at ICLR.\nMore specifically, the methodological novelty is limited and the experimental evaluation only\nevaluates the method on two fairly simple problems. \n\nOn a positive note, the authors have done a good job of illustrating the idea and have compared it\nto most natural baselines. I also thought that the illustrations of the architectures found\nfor different sample sizes (in the Appendix) quite insightful.\n\nI encourage the authors to pursue this line of work, but test this on more complex prediction tasks\nwhere entirely model-based approaches are unreliable, and entirely black-box estimators are sample\ninefficient. It also seems that the approach need not be confined to physics per se - in many\nproblems in chemistry, materials science etc. scientists are looking for ways to incorporate domain\nexpertise while accounting for model-mismatch. \n"}
