Different from the standard SISR problem, the input images of this task are compressed according to the JPEG standard, which have lower quality than what standard SISR deals with. The authors proposed a two-stage network which recovers the lossed information of compressed JPG (C-JPG) on the first stage and handles standard SR on the second stage. The whole model is trained with three L1 losses that ensure compressed information recovering, super resolution and LR-SR cycle consistency, respectively. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of this work.\n\nHowever, my main concerns on this work are: 1. this works is not technically sound w.r.t. its novelty; 2. the efficacy of each loss function is not well supported by ablation studies and 3. the comparison experiments with other methods are not clearly stated.\n\n**Main arguments:**\n\n1. This works lacks novelty since the main idea is just a simple concatenation of a JPEG-artifact-removal model and a super resolution model. Both of the components are based on former work (s-LWSR 32). There\u2019re no new insights on model design or inter-task relationship analysis provided. Besides, there\u2019re already mature solutions on JPEG-artifact-removal and super resolution, like [R1-4]. Given the fact that cascading these solutions could also solve the C-JPG super resolution problem, the practical usage of this work is limited.\n2. The efficacy of each loss function is not well supported. For example, what if we remove the $\\mathcal{L}^1_{L1}$ loss defined in equation (2)? The performance could still be better than the other counterparts since the two-stage model have two times more parameters than a single super resolution net. Likewise, the effectiveness of the cycle consistency loss $\\mathcal{L}^3_{L1}$ is also unclear. \n3. In section 4.3, the input of other leading methods during training and testing is not described clearly. For fair comparison, it should be the same as `ours`. Otherwise, the whole comparison is invalid.\n\n[R1] RESIDUAL NON-LOCAL ATTENTION NETWORKS FOR IMAGE RESTORATION, ICLR 2019.\n[R2] Residual Dense Network for Image Restoration, arXiv 2018.\n[R3] MemNet: A Persistent Memory Network for Image Restoration, ICCV 2017.\n[R4] Beyond a Gaussian Denoiser: Residual Learning of Deep CNN for Image Denoising, TIP 2018."}
