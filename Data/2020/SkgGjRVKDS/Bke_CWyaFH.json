Standard approaches are sensitive to the batch size, because small batches will lead to unstable statistics. So when the mini-batch is small, the performance can drop significantly. The paper addresses this issue by analyzing extra statistics in the batch normalization and introducing moving average statistics, weights centralization and a slightly modified normalization. The proposed method does not require large batch sizes and nonlinear operations, but still maintain the robustness. The theoretical analysis and guarantees are provided as well. Experiments on typical datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed trick.\n\nOverall, the idea is interesting to me. The work is solid in both theory and practice. Hopefully the proposed scheme has the potential to fundamentally enhance the training of deep neural networks. "}
