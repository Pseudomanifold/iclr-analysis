Compared with Alain & Bengio, 2014 which used a denoised output, the prediction function in this paper eliminates the denoised information and only gives the noise.\nThe derivation in Section 3 is nice and clear, and the derivation gives a nice alternative of using Gaussian noise for score estimation. However, the advantage of using the proposed method is not obvious, and the explanation of generator in Section 4 is unclear.\n\nIn Section 4, how is the proposition 2 applied to the sampling, and what is the situation that the condition in Eq. (12) is satisfied? To what in Algorithm 1 corresponds Delta in Proposition 2? Any of these relationships are not explained well, and unfortunately it is hard to capture the contribution of this paper though with some interesting properties.\n\nFinally, one concern is the variance of the output. The proposed algorithm is designed to estimate the noise, and it should be inefficient compared with Alain & Bengio, 2014 which uses the denoised input as the function\u2019s output. Consideration of the variance of the output and it\u2019s effect on learning should be discussed along with empirical comparison with Alain & Bengio, 2014 from this perspective.\n"}
