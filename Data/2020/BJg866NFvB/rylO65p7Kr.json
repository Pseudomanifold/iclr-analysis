Method is novel to me. Experiments are sufficient. However since I am not very familiar with this area, so there can be things I miss in the evaluation of this paper.\n\nThere is one problem with the illustrations in Figure 1: predictions on the potential outcomes before the first treatment was given should have stayed on the same path, and then depart when different treatment was initiated (at different time)"}
