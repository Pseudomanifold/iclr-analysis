The claim is that the model can decide (i) treatment plan; (ii) optimal time of treatment; and (iii) when to stop treatment. The proposed method attempts to learn time-invariant representations that are not predictive of the next treatment by borrowing ideas from Ganin, et al. (2016)\u2019s work on for domain adversarial training. In fact, this paper is an extension of (Atan et al., 2018) to be applicable for longitudinal data. \n\nThis paper should be rejected due to the following arguments:\n\t- Page 1, par. 4, line 4-7: The example given in sentence \u201cFor instance, if ...\u201d is true regardless of time. Therefore, it does not describe a situation where a time-variant confounder might make causal inference hard. In fact, nowhere in the paper there is a solid description of how time-variant confounders would break the current approaches for causal inference. \n\n\t- Page 3, par. 4, last sentence: I don\u2019t understand why sequential treatments and change of covariates through time can stop us from using the conventional methods for learning balanced representations. Why not consider each time point as an instance (thus representing each patient with multiple instances) and learn the representation from the collection of all these instances?\nAll in all, I don\u2019t understand why the authors assume that the world is non-Markovian and that they have to consider the entire \\bar{H}_t. Especially when in the their Experiments section the model used for tumor growth that generates the synthetic data is Markov, and consequently, does not check if the proposed method works in a non-Markovian world.\nIn summary, if the goal is to solve the non-Markov case, the presented experiments don\u2019t show that the proposed method is addressing that; and if the  goal is to solve the Markov case: (i) why insist on framing the problem as non-Markov; and (ii) (Atan et al., 2018) already have solved this (since we established that there are no time-dependent confounders and as the authors state on page 4, par. 3, line -4 to -3 \u201cthe novelty here comes from the use of domain adversarial training to eliminate bias from the time-dependent confounders\u201d).\n\n\t- Page 6, Theorem 1 and 2 lines above it: This theorem does not prove that the confounding bias is completely removed because the objective function in Eq. (4) being optimized also includes a loss term for outcome prediction. In fact, IF there is a confounding bias (that [partially] determines both treatment and outcome), it would be wrong to remove it from the learned representation.\n\nThings to improve the paper that did not impact the score:\n\t- Page 2, par. 1, line -2: Use of adverb \u201cMoreover\u201d is wrong. Extreme weights are due to division by small Pr(t|x). The consequence of this numerical instability is high-variance estimates.\n\t- Page 2, par. 4, 1st sentence: incomprehensible\n\t- Page 2, par. 4, line -2: \u201cbut also\u201d should come after a \u201cnot only\u201d.\n\t- Page 3, par. 4, line -1: incorrect usage of citation; both author name(s) and publication year must be in parentheses.\n\t- Page 4, par. 5, last line: sentence \u201cFor testing, the \u2026 \u201c needs elaboration.\n\t- Page 6, par. 1, line -3: \u201cstart of\u201d should be \u201cstart off\u201d.\n\nReferences:\n\t- Atan, O., Zame, W.
