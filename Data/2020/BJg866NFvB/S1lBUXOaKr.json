To address the problem, the authors propose an extension of the balancing representation for causal inference framework that seeks render the current treatment independent from a representation of the history of treatment and confounders. This is sensibly actualized within an RNN. The authors provide empirical results that demonstrate the proposed method performing very well in comparison to prior art. \n\nThis paper is well written, proposes a sensible solution to a difficult problem, and performs well empirically. It would be nice to see theory that connects the imbalance to the expected error of the causal estimand, and a notion of hyperparameter tuning (the authors say they search over hyperparameters but do not specify how the parameters are ultimately selected. However, I don't feel that either of those points outweigh the benefit of the paper. "}
