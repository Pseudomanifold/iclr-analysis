In particular, it proposes the Edge Information maximized Graph Neural Network (EIGNN) that maximizes the Mutual Information (MI) between edge features and message passing channels. The MI is reformulated as a differentiable objective via a variational approach. The experimental results have some improvement over existing methods.  Overall, the idea is novel and well presented. \n\nPros:\n1. The idea of utilizing edge features looks novel.\n2. The writing is clear.\n3. Extensive experiments are done to verify the performance of the proposed method.\n\nCons:\n1. The theoretical analysis is just a regular routine. \n2. How does the hyper-parameter affect the performance? In other words, how does the component of the edge features affect the model performance?"}
