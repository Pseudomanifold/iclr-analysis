Specifically, a variational lower bound is proposed for mutual information and integrated into the GNN model so that MI between edge features and the message passing channel is maximized. Experiments on molecule graph datasets and knowledge graph datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to the state-of-the-art GNN models.\n\nUtilizing continuous edge features in GNN is an important and difficult task. The authors proposed an elegant solution. The paper is well written and extensive experiments on large scale datasets are compared with 9 competitors that are all outperformed by EIGNN on nearly all the cases.\n\nTo conclude, I think the paper will be a good addition to the conference."}
