The paper is a nice balance between theory and practical effect, since it shows that at the end spectral embedding has an impact on larger connected block units of the graph, discarding isolated nodes. \n\nIt also introduces the problem in a gentle way, so that the range of possible readers is wide.\n\nIn general I'm happy with the paper, no major lacks on my side\n\nSuggestions: it is not clear how to get to Eq.7), the authors should explain the last passage before that equation a little more?  How the values of the noise alpha have been selected? How the approach scales with the number of blocks, in term of complexity?\n\n"}
