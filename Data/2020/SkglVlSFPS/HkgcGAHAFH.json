The exploration is based on risk- sensitivity measures such as moments and relative majority vote. There is a lot of work currently trying to marry the model free with model based approaches for integrated planning and learning as the authors have mentioned in the related work section of the paper and also called out similar methods and techniques. The authors have provided evidence via experiments in three environments and shown good results of using this blended approach. Code is also provided for others to further carry out explorations in this research area.\n"}
