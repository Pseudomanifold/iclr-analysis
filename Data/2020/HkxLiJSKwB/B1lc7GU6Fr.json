Different from GVIN, which uses spatial kernel to perform graph convolution, the proposed GrMPN method uses neural message passing, with the aim to be invariant to graph isomorphism. Two particular instances of the neural message passing were realized and evaluated, which are graph network (GN) and graph attention network (GAT). In the experiments, the proposed GrMPN were shown to be effective on motion planning, through either regular or irregular graphs.\n\nThere are several points that the authors may want to further clarify in this paper. Since the proposed GrMPN is claimed to generalize existing graph-based planning algorithms, a discussion on how does the generalization is achieved is desired, e.g., compare with GVIN. It seems the key motivation to develop GrMPN is to obtain the invariance to graph isomorphism which cannot be handled by existing methods. However, the discussions on why is it important to handle this problem, and how can GrMPN achieve the invariance but others cannot, are insufficient in the technical section. Moreover, it is not clear on why imitation learning is selected over reinforcement learning in this work, considering the previous work GVIN uses reinforcement learning. Overall, the technical development on GVIN in this work seems to be limited, which lies largely on the employment of a different graph convolution method.\n"}
