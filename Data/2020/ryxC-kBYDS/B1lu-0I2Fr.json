Methods for inference and parameter learning are presented both for a \"Bayesian\" and maximum likelihood version. The method is demonstrated on several data sets.\n\nQUALITY\nIn general, the technical quality of the paper is good. Except for minor typos, derivations appear to be correct, although I did not check everything in detail. \n\nCLARITY\nThe paper could be improved by a careful revision with focus on improving grammar, but as it stands the paper is easy to follow.\nIt is not clear to me exactly how the numbers in Table 1 were computed. Is this based on 10-fold crossvalidation as in the following tables?\n\nORIGINALITY\nI am not familiar enough with the field to assess the novelty of the contribution. It would be great if the paper provided a better overview of competing structured classification methods.\n\nFURTHER COMMENTS\n\n\"structured classification\" ?\n\n\"It was shown\" -> We show\n\n\"for given\"\n\nIs the second sum over k=1 to K in eq. 1 a mistake?\n\n\"We void\" -> We avoid\n\n"}
