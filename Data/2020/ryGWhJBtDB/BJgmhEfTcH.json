They observe that the behaviors seem to arise in different batch sizes \n\nThe authors derive empirical conclusions and perform experiments in different settings. The paper is well-written and the experimental setup seems to be carefully carried out. \n\nI find the observations interesting, but the contribution is empirical and not entirely new. It would be nice if there were some theoretical results to back up the observations. "}
