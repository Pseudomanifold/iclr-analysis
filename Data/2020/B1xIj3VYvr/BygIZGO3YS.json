The core content of the method is to learn mapping between bags and their associated bag level ucc labels and then to predict the ucc labels of unseen bags. \nPositive:\n(1) The authors use the unique class count(UCC) in the bag as a weak, bag level label to design a deep learning based UCC model for extracting features and clustering the individual instances in the unseen bags. They also construct a new optimization objective function by combining ucc loss and autoencoder loss. This is a novel weakly-supervised clustering method rarely seen.\n(2) In this paper, a large number of experiments show the effectiveness of the algorithm in different data sets and semantic segmentation of breast cancer metastases.\nNegative:\n(1) The authors use KDE method to estimate the distribution of extracted features as the input of distribution regression module, but it is not clear how the description of KDE method updates on the parameters of the auto-encoder.\n(2) The proofs of some propositions in Appendix B are very obvious and redundant. The authors\u2019 proofs are not enough to prove whether the designed UCC classifier is perfect."}
