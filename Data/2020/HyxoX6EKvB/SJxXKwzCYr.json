There is a lot of discussion of\nelementary ideas such as reflection about an affine plain and involutions.  The key technical idea in the paper is given in the definition of the objective function in equation (16).  The notation in this equation is unfortunate as the parameter vector Theta does not appear in the loss expression and some guesswork is needed to realize that y_i is hat{t}_\\Theta(x_i).  The discussion of optimization seems strange --- why not just apply a standard optimizer to this loss function?  The experimental results are limited to three attributes one of which --- the capital/country attribute --- seems a relation not an attribute.\n\nBut the most serious problem with this paper is a lack of references to related work.  I would start with the following reference and track papers that reference it.\n\n\"Unsupervised Morphology Induction Using Word Embeddings\" by Radu Soricut, Franz Och, NAACL 2015."}
