In this scheme, a Teacher generates data according to a Gaussian random field, and a Student learns them via kernel regression. Theresults quantify how smooth Gaussian data should be to avoid the curse of dimensionality, and indicate that for kernel learning the relevant dimension of the data should be defined in terms of how the distance between nearest data points depends on sample numbers.\nThe paper is well written, tghe major issue of this paper is the lack of comparison with other previous methods. Therefore, the efficacy of the proposed model can not be well demontrated."}
