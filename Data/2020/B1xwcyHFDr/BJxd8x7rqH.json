(2000) to the unsupervised setting. By taking advantage of multi-view data, they provide two views of the same underlying entity.  Experimetal results on two standard multi-view datasets validate the efficacy of the proposed method.\nI have three questions about this work.\n1. The proposed method only provides two views of the same underlying entity, what about 3 or more views?\n2. Can this method be used for multi-modality case?\n3. What about the time efficiency of the proposed method?"}
