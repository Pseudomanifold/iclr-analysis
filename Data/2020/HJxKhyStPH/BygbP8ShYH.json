The authors claim that their contributions consist of two parts: 1) proving that the proper selection of loss functions is vital in KGE; 2) proposing a model called TransComplEx. The results show that the proper selection of the loss function can mitigate the limitations of TransX (X=H, D, R, etc) models.\n\nMy major concerns are as follows.\n1.\tThe motivation of TransComplEx and why it works are unclear in the paper.\n2.\tThe experiments might be unconvincing. In the experiments, the authors claim that they implement RotatE [1] in their setting to make a fair comparison. However, with their setting, the performance of RotatE is much worse than that in the original paper [1]. Therefore, the experiments might be unfair to RotatE.\n3.\tThere are some typos in this paper. For example, in Line 11 of Section 4.3, the comma should be a period; in Section 5, the \"Dissuasion of Results\" should be \"Discussion of Results\".\n\n[1] Zhiqing Sun, Zhi-Hong Deng, Jian-Yun Nie, and Jian Tang.
