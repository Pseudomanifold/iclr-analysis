The authors propose four variants of loss function which address the limitations and propose a method, RPTransComplEx which utilizes their observations for outperforming several existing Knowledge Graph embedding methods. Overall, the proposed method is well motivated and experimental results have been found to be consistent with the theoretical analysis.\n\nSuggestions/Questions:\n\n1. It would be great if hyperparameters listed in the \u201cExperimental Setup\u201d section could be presented in a table for better readability. \n\n2. In Section 2, the authors have mentioned that RotatE obtains SOTA results using a very large embedding dimension (1000). However, it gives very similar performance even with smaller dimensional embedding (such as 200) with 1000 negative samples. In Section 5, RotatE results with 200 dimension and 10 negative samples are reported for a fair comparison. Wouldn\u2019t it be better to instead increase the number of negative samples in RPTransComplEx instead of decreasing negative samples in RotatE?\n\n3. In Table 3, it is not clear why authors have not reported their performance on the WN18RR dataset for their methods. Also, the reported performance of TransE in [1] is much better than what is reported in the paper. \n\n[1] Sun, Zhiqing, Zhi-Hong Deng, Jian-Yun Nie and Jian Tang. \u201cRotatE: Knowledge Graph Embedding by Relational Rotation in Complex Space.\u201d ArXiv abs/1902.10197 (2019): n. pag.\n"}
