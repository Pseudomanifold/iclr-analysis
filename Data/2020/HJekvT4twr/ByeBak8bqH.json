Summary: The authors proposed a deep neural network-based model to generate responses fro task-oriented dialogue systems. The model mainly contains two parts, the first part is to retrieve relevant responses based on question and encode them into templates, the second part is a decoder to generate the response based on the encoded templates and input utterances.\n2. Assessment: The problem studied in this work is very interesting and important. The high-level idea also looks interesting. However, this paper is clearly not ready to submit as it contains a lot of grammar errors and lacks a lot of important details. \n2.1 \"In our model, we retrieval ...\" => \"we retrieve\", \"which is composed of a encoder ...\" => \"an encoder\". There are too many such language errors in this paper. \n2.2 Table 2 is not finished yet. There's only one result in it.\n2.3 What does \"triple form\" mean? What are the candidate responses to retrieve when doing inference? What are the details of reference response retrieval? To many such important details are missing."}
