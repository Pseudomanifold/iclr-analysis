The main novelty seems to be: 1) the model can mix multiple templates to respond; 2) the response is generated using a combination of templates and a language model (directly) conditioned on the input.\n\nThe paper studies an interesting task however it is not ready for\npublication:\n- Empirical results of all baselines are missing (Table 2)\n- Other results are mentioned but are absent from the manuscript\n- The related work does not provide details as to how the proposed model to prior work\n- The figures are difficult to understand (although they do help make the model clearer and so I suggest polishing them for the next version of this work)\n- The manuscript should be carefully copy-edited.\n"}
