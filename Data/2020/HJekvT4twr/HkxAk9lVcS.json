While the motivation and task setup is interesting, the paper is clearly unfinished. Most jarringly, Table 2 which should contain the main results comparing the proposed RGTI model to existing baseline models is not filled in, and there appears to be no table showing results of the ablation study briefly described in Section 3.4.\n\nOther issues include the lack of detail around any of the subtasks mention. For example, in Sec 2.1, how is semantic information used as search criteria to retrieve responses? We also need to see more details about where responses are retrieved from. In Sec 2.2, how is the splitting done to construct tuples from the candidate templates (the word \"in\" is dropped in the example given, and it's not clear if this is a typo or whether some processing is done over the phrases before tuple construction is done).\n\nOther comments:\n- The paper needs to be heavily proofread. There are many spelling/grammar mistakes, for example:\n\t- dilogue -> dialogue (Figure 2, page 2)\n\t- acurrate -> accurate (top of page 3)\n        - \"First we should retrieval responses\" -> \"retrieve responses\" (page 3)\n        - BlEU -> BLEU (page 5)"}
