Experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in semantic segmentation. The idea is interesting and somewhat reasonable but I still have several concerns. However, I still have several concerns:\n1.\tThe authors proposed to compose the free-form filters and structured filters with a two-step convolution. The authors are expected to clarify why and how the decomposition can realized its purpose? The authors need to further justify the methods by providing more theoretical analysis, and comparing with alternative methods. \n2.\tThe experiments are rather insufficient, and the authors are expected to make more comprehensive evaluations, e.g., more comparisons with the traditional CNN models. \n3.\tThe improvement is rather incremental compared with the alternative methods. The authors actually introduce some prior to the learning process. It would be better if the authors could show some other advantages, e.g., whether it can train the model with smaller number of samples, and whether we can integrate other prior besides Gaussian filters for other structures since Gaussian is a good prior for blurring. \n"}
