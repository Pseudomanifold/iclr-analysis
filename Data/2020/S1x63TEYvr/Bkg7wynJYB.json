The system achieves best current published result on the HotpotQA dataset.\n\nThe system achieves that using question-aware representation of the document.\n\nQuestion: would it be possible to re-generate, at least in an approximate form, one of the reformulations of the question, using decoding? It seems that the visualization of these intermediate forms would allow to understand the model better."}
