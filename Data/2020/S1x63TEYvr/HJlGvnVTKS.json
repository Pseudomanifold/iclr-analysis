The reformulation of the question depends on the question-aware representation of the documents. \n\nThe authors experiment their model on the HotpotQA dataset and achieve the state of the art performance. But, it's important to experiment with some other datasets. One option could be the Complex WebQuestions [1]. \n\nSince T is set to 2 in your experiment, is it possible that your model simply predict the intermediate answers and use it to reformulate the question representation? In Talmor et. al paper [1], the SplitQA splits the questions into two subquestions, and appends the answer of the first subquestion to the second subquestion.\n\nAnother related work is PullNet by Sun et. al [2].\n\n[1] Talmor, Alon, and Jonathan Berant. \"The web as a knowledge-base for answering complex questions.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1803.06643 (2018).\n[2] Sun, Haitian, Tania Bedrax-Weiss, and William W.
