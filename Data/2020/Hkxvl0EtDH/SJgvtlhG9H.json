The author further elaborately devises experiment on the standard dataset and achieve good results.\n\nStrong point:\n(1)\tThe paper is well-written and the idea is motivated.\n(2)\tThe experiment is convincing and the result is good.\n\nWeak point:\n(1)\tPlease provide the deducing process of the ELBO, such as how the ELBO is deduced in the training mode and the prediction process should be elaborated detailedly.\n(2)\tThe symbolism is confusing, such as the \\phi_1 and \\phi_2 in Eq(6).\n(3)\tWhat is the difference between manipulations M and the latent style Z? Do they belong to the domain information? Please justify. \n"}
