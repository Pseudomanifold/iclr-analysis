I think this paper would be better suited for a more application-specific conference that would be more interested in the empirical progress on a task specific to autonomous vehicles.\n\nAs a last note, the paper contains a large number of grammatical errors and typos - I\u2019m not considering these in the score, but the paper would benefit from a close proofreading by a native English speaker."}
