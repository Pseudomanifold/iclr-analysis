The loss is used in two cases: generating adversarial point clouds to attack representative models of point set classifiers, and generating cooperative point clouds to improve classification confidence or accuracy. The combined geometry-aware objective is well-introduced, which mainly contains Chamfer distance term, Hausdorff distance term and local curvatures consistency term. The authors apply the geometry-aware objective to generate adversarial point clouds by adopting the framework of C&W attack. For generating cooperative point clouds, the authors introduced a training procedure to reduce the overfitting of the deformed point clouds. Most of the experiments are well-conducted, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed loss function. \n\nOverall, the paper is a well-written and could be an interesting contribution. However, I would like it better if it does not contain the part about the cooperative point clouds, which are not very motivated and the experiment settings are not very convincing. The algorithm in page 5 inherently used testing labels (suppose some testing data is in the training split of one of those cross-validation folds, training for the P_i' for the rest of the training data). I don't know why experiment results generated by this method would be of any meaning. I would be OK to accept this paper if the cooperative point cloud part is dropped.\n\n- In page 5, the authors introduce a procedure to train the model. The first step would require take the \u201cconsideration of class balance\u201d. It would be better to give some details on how the class balance is considered.\n\n- In ablation study, the authors give some visualization results in Figure 1. However, it would be more interesting if the authors could give some quantitative results. \n\n- It would be interesting to show some ablation study on how to choose the  \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03bb .\n"}
