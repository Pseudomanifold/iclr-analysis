Inputs for a subject include covariates (age, gender, etc) and an event sequence. A key difficulty in the problem is that the lifetime of a subject is often unobserved. The proposed method is to learn a termination function that is non-decreasing with time, which essentially treats prolonged inactivity as termination in a probabilistic way. Clustering is done in a discriminative manner where the objective function considers cluster sizes besides between-cluster differences in lifetime distribution. (The inclusion of cluster size information in the objective function avoids degenerate clustering results.)\nThe paper is strong in technical contents. The objective function is well-motivated and placed on solid theoretical foundation. Empirically, the proposed method performed significantly better than baselines.\nThe weakness of the paper is that the utility of the work has not been demonstrated. For example, the Friendster dataset (1.1 million social network users) is partitioned into 2-5 clusters. However, are there clusters that a service provider can use to improve their service? It is doubtful whether such \u201cuseful\u201d clusters can be found using the proposed algorithm. One might need to obtain a fairly large number of clusters, via conditioning perhaps, before finding some really useful ones. \n\u2022\tThe paper is strong in technical contents.

Potential impact is an outstanding issue here because the proposed method is very special-purpose. \n\nQuestion to the authors: It is observed that the numbers of friends and comments are strongly correlated with the clustering. Were those two covariates included in the analysis? If not, why?\n\n"}
