The main idea is to formulate the problem as a sequence-to-sequence problem namely a mapping from a set of call site sequences to procedure names. The main contribution of this paper is the application of seq2seq models with attention mechanism to the aforementioned task. The authors evaluated their method only one dataset which they constructed themselves.\n\nOverall, this paper is interesting because of its quite special application. However, the contribution from methodic perspectives is very limited. Furthermore, it is difficult for me to make sense of all the numbers, whether they are good or bad although the authors show consistent improvements compared to state-of-the-art methods. It also means that this paper lacks a deep analysis which will help readers to better understand the impact of the proposed method within the target domain. \n\nOverall, I recommend to reject this paper because of its very limited impact to the representation learning research field.\n"}
