The introduction and presenation of the approach are well written. The introduction provides a valuable overview and characterization of existing work and motivates the approach proposed in this work. Sections 2 through 5, together with the supplementary material provide a comprehensible description and derivation of the approaches to classification and clustering, together with the corresponding algorithms.\nHowever, experimental section leaves open a number of questions. First of all, for readers not familiar with the task used here, a more detailed description would be desirable, including moving Supplementary Section D into the main text. In Suppl. Sec. D also a succinct definition of the classification task should be provided. What exactly are the classiffication tasks you solve for the Bank and Adult dataset, i.e. what is the set (and number) of classes in both cases?\nFigs. 1 (a) and (b): you should provide a legend defining the red and blue curves.\nFig 1 (c): without knowing the other approaches cited here, some comment on the differences in the classifier models used would be helpful to evaluate the differences in test error. Effectively, the reader would like to get an indication, what the differences in test error are induced by: difference in the regulatory fairness terms, or also differences in the classifier models.\nOverall, the three datasets used to test the approach seem to be fairly limited, as are the corresponding classifier models used. It would be interesting to get an indication of how the approach would perform on/scale to much larger tasks with (much) deeper classification models?\nCompletely missing is a final overall conclusion section."}
