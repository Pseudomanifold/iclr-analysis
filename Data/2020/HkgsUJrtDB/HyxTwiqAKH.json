This is motivated by the limitation of standard notions of correlation that they only capture linear correlations. \nThe proposed approach is a formulation using the Renyi correlation as a regularization term, which leads to a min-max formulation due to the definition of Renyi correlation as the maximum correlation between any functionals of the variables in question.\nThe paper then describes in detail how the computation can be done by making use of the fact that Renyi correlation can be computed using singular values of the relevant matrix, and provides computation time analyses for a couple of different assumptions. \nThe authors also apply the analogous idea to (k means) clustering to derive what they call the Renyi fair clustering. \nIn the experimental evaluation section, they evaluate the performance of the proposed methods with respect to the accuracy fairness trade-off, using 3 publicly available real world data sets and with the 2 standard definition of group fairness. The experimental results show quite convincingly that the trade of is improved by Renyi correlation as compared to the use of standard correlations.  They also evaluate the Renyi fair clustering method using a fairness metric they propose for evaluating the uniformity of clustering results.\nOverall the paper presents a crisp new idea, develops sound theoretical analysis and algorithms, and validate their superiority with satisfactory experiments.
