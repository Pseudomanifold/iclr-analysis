Authors claim that they propose a novel, attention-based loss function in order to check whether a condition is met.\n\nEvaluation of the methodology is performed on the SquAD 2.0 dataset. It is organized behind combining existing, state of the art solutions like BERT  or QANet. It is improving these solutions consistently."}
