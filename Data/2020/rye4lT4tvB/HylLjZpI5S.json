Dilation as a function of input at individual pixels is achieved through sampling  probability distributions that are conditioned by pixel-wise input features (Gumbel-Softmax is used to approximate the sampling process in order to ensure end-to end differentiability).  The paper makes the assumption that dilation values are related to inter-layer\npatterns between convolution layers due to their hierarchical nature and the RF size at each\nlocation is adjusted based on information flows between corresponding inter-layer pixels during\nforward propagation.\n\nPROS:  Addresses adaptation of local context and feature dependent modification of receptive field size,  Experiments are shown to improve semantic segmentation performance in a number of datasets.  \nCons:  Incremental evolution of existing ideas,  Too much claim (especially on discussion section) on how the design leads to more interpretability.  The claims are still largely empirical without theoretical grounding.  Only a few images are shown illustrating performance.  The paper should also show examples where there are fundamental limitations. Thus, one does not see what challenges (if any) remain.  If the authors address these above concerns in the rebuttal, I will be inclined to reexamine the rating."}
