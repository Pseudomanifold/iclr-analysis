In addition, as for model calibration, they also considered temperature and vector scaling and introduced intermediaries between those, namely, NBVS and TBVS.\n\nOverall, the paper is well organized and provides rigorous experiments with conclusions based on the empirical observations. As stated in the paper, the main contribution of this work is to explore the impact of calibration. \n\nHowever, it is still doubtful whether those empirical results can be generalized as there is no analytical and thoughtful discussions. Further, the label shift was simulated by means of dirichlet shift on both datasets. It would be great to apply the method on real cases. "}
