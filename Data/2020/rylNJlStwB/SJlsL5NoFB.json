While the idea of using synthetic data (which can be easily procedurally generated) to do this reverse-engineer training is very clever, prior work has exploited it also. Novel elements include the attribute refinement using imitation learning, and the authors show the effect of this step, but the improvement is small. Thus, the limited novelty and not very convincing results make the question the potential impact of this paper.\n\nSome questions:\na) The authors mention they cannot use a GAN-style method because all generated images are by definition true/real; how about learning whether a *pair* is real or fake? (where the pair consists of the design specification and the rendered version). \nb) Are the baselines strong enough? None of them seem to be from recent prior work. How about a direct comparison to some of the work listed in the second para on page 2?"}
