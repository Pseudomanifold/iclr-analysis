For regression the method is based on Gaussian assumption, which has no reason to be correct (especially for BayesianNN), and for classification the method is not clear at all.\n\nDetailed remarks:\n- For a BNN, there is no reason why p(y|x) is Gaussian, so even if the residual is rejected as chi-square this doesn't mean anything.\n- I am unclear as to how the classifier uncertainty is measured. \n- The paper claims that \"it is preferable to assess the variances separately.\" which I agree with, but a mistake in the mean would effect your chi-square test, so it is not separated.\n- I am unclear as to what statistical test you perform to accept/reject the chi-square hypothesis.\n "}
