Continuous\nequivariance, potential field representation, and bandwidth limited\nbasis functions are synthesized in a compelling manner.\n\nI found the exposition extremely intelligible despite my lack of\nfamiliarity with molecular modeling.\n\nThe contribution is clear, although applicability beyond the specific\ndomain of molecular modeling is possibly limited.  Being continuously\nequivariant with respect to rotations is interesting, but seems to require\nproblems where the input is encoded as a point cloud in a vector space;\nI'm not familiar with such problems.  Nonetheless, the domain of molecular\nmodeling is sufficiently important in isolation.\n\nI recommend acceptance, because the contribution is strong, the writing\nis excellent, the ideas are well-motivated, and the experiments support\nthe empirical claims.\n"}
