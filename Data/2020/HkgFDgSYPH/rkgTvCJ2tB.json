AOP is able extensive plan only when necessary, leading to over all average reduced computation times. AOP can be easily integrated into other reinforcement learning frameworks such as to any offline-planning reinforcement learning algorithms.  The experiments demonstrate that AOP is computationally efficient compared to traditional baselines MPC-8 and MPC-3 while maintaining the performances.\n\nThe algorithm is developed based on heuristic solutions to address some of the fundamental problems in reinforcement learning, and although the proposed strategies definitely seem to provide some benefits in terms of computation complexity, the solution is not very elagant or noval. It is hard to justify the computational efficiency and performance in dynamically changing environments just based on the presented results. While the improvement in computation is there, what I find lacking is the experiments demonstrating clear evidence of overcoming catastrophic forgetting problem. The paper gives off a feeling that AOP as an add-on that can increase the performance of any  RL algorithm. \n"}
