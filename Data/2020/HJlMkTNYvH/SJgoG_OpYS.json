Authors report quantitative (metric: precision of k-means++ clustering & AtEdge-length) and qualitative analysis (visualization). \n\n[Comments]\nExperimental analysis could improve e.g. by including more baselines (e.g. other baselines the authors cite in the paper), or by providing more quantitative analysis - e.g. performance at varying degree of completeness / artificial perturbation of the graph. In the current manuscript, the quantitative analysis does not immediately show the benefit or the characteristics of the proposed approaches. In the main section of the manuscript, the analysis is limited to citation networks. \n\nWhile the idea of leveraging both semantic and structural information for the purpose of dimensionality reduction seems to be new and interesting, similar approaches have been explored for text classification tasks (e.g. via graph convolutional networks).
