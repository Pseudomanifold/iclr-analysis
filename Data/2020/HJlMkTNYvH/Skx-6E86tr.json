Since the overall error defined in (5) is a weighted summation of three objectives, it is not a real multi-objective optimization where multiple objectives are optimized simultaneously. \n\nAuthors define a hypergraph to jointly model documents and entities. However, there lacks the novelty on the objectives defined in this paper. The optimization using gradient descent is also trivial. \n\nIt is hard to understand why equations (2) and (3) share the same objectives but the two sets of samples have totally different meanings. Moreover, both objectives are summed uniformly as shown in the experimental setting. Please explain it in details.\n\nFor the quantitative evaluation, Table 1 shows the percentage of papers for each community per cluster. There are many numbers for a single clustering problem. It might be preferred to use a single measurement such as normalized mutual information or accuracy for clustering evaluation. In this way, it is easy to judge the compared methods.\n"}
