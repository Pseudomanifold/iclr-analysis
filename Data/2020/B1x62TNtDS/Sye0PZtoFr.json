The paper also conducts some experiments on how well mutual information estimators satisfy some of the core properties of mutual information in practice.\n\nThe core result of Theorem 2, although is proof is very simple once the problem has been phrased appropriately, is enlightening.\n\nThe self-consistency tests are also sensible and important, although it would be nice to understand better which of these properties are truly important for various uses of mutual information in the literature.\n\nThe proposed SMILE estimator is natural. But:\n\n- As $\\tau \\to \\infty$, the variance bound of Theorem 4 naturally becomes infinite (as we'd expect). But we'd hope that the bias would become 0, when in fact Theorem 3 only shows in this case that the bias is at most S. Of course it should be true that $\\mathbb E_Q[r] = \\mathbb E_Q[r_\\infty]$; can we fix Theorem 3 so that it recovers this fact?\n\nThen the biggest question not really addressed by this paper is: how do you set $\\tau$?\n\n- If we know the (approximate) value of $S$, then we can presumably trade off between the bias and variance terms of Theorem 3 and 4 to find the most effective value for $\\tau$. (Indeed, it might be nice to write a corollary showing that if you set $\\tau$ to something depending on $n$ and some upper bound on $S$, you achieve some rate in L2 risk.)\n\n- Is it possible to relate the value of $S$ to, say, the suboptimality in cross-entropy loss of the classifier used to obtain $r$ (when getting $r$ that way)?\n\n- Is it possible to get a probabilistic upper bound on $S$, either with some other technique or perhaps a simple Hoeffding/Bernstein-type bound on the SMILE estimator with some initial value of $\\tau$, and then use that to choose the rate for $\\tau$?\n\n- Is there some other practical scheme (even if it doesn't admit bounds) to set $\\tau$ to control the bias, given that it depends on $S$?\n\n\n\nSmaller points and minor suggestions:\n\n- In the paragraph following Theorem 2, it is first of all strange to say that \"alternative procedures to obtaining the density ratio estimates will not alleviate the high variance issue\" when indeed your proposal does just that. The last sentence of this paragraph clarifies the issue, but still makes $r \\ne r^*$ sound \"bad,\" when in fact it's a trade-off; this could be rephrased more clearly.\n\n- In Theorem 3: I think writing $e^{-2 \\tau} \\lvert S - e^\\tau \\rvert$ would be clearer than $\\lvert e^{-\\tau} - S e^{-2 \\tau} \\rvert$ as you have it.\n\n- In the multivariate Gaussian experiments, Section 6.1: why do you effectively warm-start the estimator for higher mutual informations? Is it just so you can put things in one plot per method? I think it would be more natural to train each different problem from scratch; you can still use the same plot format if you like (with additional vertical lines between problems or something), but it's not clear whether the behavior of the estimator is affected by this choice.\n\n- Why are the flow-based results not shown in Figure 2 / Table 2?\n\n- In Section 6.2 when setting up the three evaluation settings, it would be good to have a forward reference to Figure 3 (since these settings are perhaps easier to understand visually)."}
