This approach is empirically demonstrated on cifar10 and tiny imagenet with different network architectures including all convolutional net, wide residual net and dense net. \n\nThis paper is well written and organized. However, I have several concerns.  The novelty of the proposed method is limited. The unsupervised objective in eq. (3) is a good and straightforward  engineering trick, but it is of less scientific interest.  The empirical results are not encouraging. Table1 shows the comparison results between the proposed method and a baseline method, however, for ALL-CNN, the reported top1 in the original paper is 92.75%. The reviewer is aware that this paper mentions the proposed method doesn't apply regularization, but why not compare to the original results. Results shown in figs. 2,3,4 are obvious because the proposed objective eq.3 prefers a higher invariance score in eq(2) and the increasing alphas prefer increasing invariance score. \n\nIn my opinion this work is not sufficient for ICLR.
