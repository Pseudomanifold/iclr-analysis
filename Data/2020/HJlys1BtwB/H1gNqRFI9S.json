The method presented consists merely of giving progressively more importance to informal data over formal data. They evaluate their approach on sequence labeling tasks such as named entity recognition (NER), part-of-speech (POS) tagging and chunking.  The paper reads more like an analysis of one hyperparameter of a model than an actual contribution, and presents little to no novelty. The algorithmic or technical contributions of this paper are not sufficient for a venue like ICLR."}
