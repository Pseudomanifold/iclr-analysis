Ablation studies also considered network\u2019s accuracy under perturbation of weight signs, weight shuffling, and different standard deviations.\n+ The authors also verified the effectiveness of weak labels used in self-supervised learning.\n\nCons\n- The work itself did not propose any new network properties or any new metric to measure. Most experiments are designed for previous observations and mostly for verification purpose. I am concern about the core motivation of this work, like to identify or solve any new problems, in addition to experimentally verify the observations during network\u2019s training.\n- The conclusion in this work is still very empirical: it remains uncertain whether in other vision tasks and with more complex networks (e.g. multi-branch network) these conclusions would hold."}
