By some studies on the lottery ticket hypothesis, something important happens during the early phase of training so rewinding the network should go to these early phases instead of the initial phase. So, what is important during training? The paper explores this problem from four aspects through empirical studies: \n1. By showing the various statistics through different training iterations, especially the gradient magnitude, the training phase is divided into three parts, and each part has different behaviors.\n2. The paper explores what is more important for the early phase of training: signs of the weights or magnitude of the weights.\n3. The paper explores what is more important for the early phase of training if we redistribute the weights, signs or magnitudes.\n4. The paper explores how training depends on data. Giving weak information such as self-supervised information may work but giving wrong information such as random labels will hurt the performance.\n\nThis paper studies the properties of deep neural networks. Through a series of carefully designed experiments, the paper shows what is important for the weights (magnitude or signs), and what is important for the data (weak information or random information). It enables a deep understanding of neural networks and may motivate new neural network compression methods to be proposed. Generally, the paper is well-written, although some parts can be improved. I would vote for acceptance of the paper.\n\nSome questions/suggestions to make the paper clearer:\n1. It is better to have a table summarizing various results of the paper, to give readers an overall impression after going through so many detailed experimental results.\n2. The results of Fig. 4 and Fig.6 can be inconsistent. In Figure 4, it says that signs are less important than magnitudes. In Figure 6, it says that signs are more important than magnitudes if shuffling filters and keep signs. Any explanation on the inconsistency?\n3. There is no explanation of the \u201cweight trace\u201d in Figure 3.\n4. It is not clear what is the difference between \u201cInit\u201d and \u201cFinal\u201d in \u201cL2 Dist\u201d and \u201cCosine Similarity\u201d in Figure 3. \n\nFinally,  it is said in the \u201ccall for papers\u201d, \u201cReviewers will be instructed to apply a higher standard to papers in excess of 8 pages\u201d. This paper is nearly nine pages, and higher standards should be applied. \n"}
