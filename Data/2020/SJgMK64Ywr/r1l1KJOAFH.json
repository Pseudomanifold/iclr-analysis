In particular, it applies this to finding better neural architectures for video understanding, emphasizing exploring the video temporal resolutions needed and how to combine intermediate representations capturing appearance and motion. It introduces a somewhat new algorithm for connection-strength-weighted architecture evolution focused on this high-level information fusion problem of video understanding.\n\nI am no expert in the problem domain of this paper (video understanding) but I fond the paper very clear and well-written and easy to understand. The techniques and thinking used seemed good (e.g., using dilated convolutions rather than manual preparing videos with different temporal resolutions!). \n\nThe evolutionary search algorithm was not wildly original or a huge breakthough in the general context of previous work, but seems appropriate, well thought out and works well. \n\nThe results reported are very strong. They get state-of-the-art results on two datasets. I particularly appreciated the evident care in producing strong baselines and ablations (their Charades 2-stream baseline also outperforms all previous work; they show the general strength of four-stream architectures and a random architecture with connection strength learning).\n\nYou mention at the start of section 4.2 that your models have the equivalent number of parameters to ResNet-50. This is good, but you should probably emphasize it more/earlier, since I'd been worrying that you were only winning due to size...."}
