However, there is no indication that any of these methods address sample-efficiency which would be an interesting and useful contribution.\nAlso the experiments are neither very conclusive nor are they easy to interpret. For example in the pong case, there is no discernable effect of the compression ratio as the highest and lowest compression give the best (and comparable) results. Also the results come without confidence intervals.\n\nSo, in general, I would consider this paper to be an uninspired combination of pre-existing ideas with weak and inconclusive experimental results: a clear reject."}
