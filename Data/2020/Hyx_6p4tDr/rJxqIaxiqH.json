The key idea is to assume the frontal slices of the projection matrix T to be low-rank. Also, it performs random sampling from a distribution to fill the entries of the project matrices E and F, making them random instead of learning from data. The effectiveness of this random projection is theoretically analyzed based on different distributions. Experimental study is conducted on action segmentation to compare the proposed scheme with the existing ones. \n\nThis paper is well-organised and carefully presented. Nevertheless, with respect to the literature, the technical novelty (low-rank assumption and random matrix projection) seems to be limited. Moreover, the experimental study is not as strong as the expected. The improvement over the existing methods is not sufficiently signficant or consistent. For action recognition, only the results of GTEA in Table 2 are promising. Experimental study on other vision tasks and benchmark datasets shall to be conducted to provide more validation, for example, by using Fine-grained image recognition datasets which have been widely used to assess bilinear based methods."}
