The results are on four popular benchmarks and they also test on Many Permutations, which is an important finding as well.  While the angle based approach presented here is interesting and intuitively appealing, I am not really sure whether it is a needed generalization beyond past approaches. I don't really have a strong intuition for where the gains are coming from. As such, I think the paper would be much stronger if it could intuitively or theoretically get at why it improves on past approaches. \n\nActually, one of my biggest concerns is how good the performance of the direct approach is. The direct approach seems like a straightforward extension of experience replay with a special learning rate for current examples vs. buffer examples that is adaptive to the relative loss.  While it is potentially interesting that this approach works so well, it is not positioned as the selling point of the paper as currently written. Additionally, this is kind of an orthogonal contribution to past papers leveraging experience replay, which could potentially be modified and improved based on this approach. I wonder if the authors tried modifying any of the baseline approaches in this way as well. \n\nA small note on the experiments: the authors closely follow settings from past work and at times it can be unclear which results were implemented in this paper and which in past papers. I don't think that you have addressed what hyperparameters you chose for MER. It also seems to perform worse than past reported results on CIFAR and is not reported despite the best past performance on MNIST Permutations. "}
