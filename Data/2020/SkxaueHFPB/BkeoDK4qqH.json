The solution is related to other recently proposed work, but the paper brings additional insights into understanding it.\n\nThe analysis on conditions that lead to divergence or convergence, and of the proposed solution, are interesting. I recommend accepting.\n\nI have some basic knowledge of GANs but am not deeply familiar with the field. The paper was accessible to me on a high level. Especially compelling to me were sections 2 and 3. The empirical study also seemed to yield positive results.\n\nSuggestions for improvement:\n- Additional proofreading would be beneficial.\n- The scale of the axes in figure 1 is not clear, making it a little less compelling.\n- Inception score is used as the only evaluation metric for the generators. Perhaps this is standard in the field, although human ratings would seem more reliable to me."}
