Summary\n\nThe authors learn structured communication patterns between multiple RL agents. Their framework uses a Structured Communication Network Module and Communication-based Policy Module. These use a hierarchical decomposition of the multi-agent system and a graph neural network that operates over the resulting abstract agent (groups). The authors evaluate on two environments, where this approach outperforms other ways to communication protocols.\n\n2. Decision (accept or reject) with one or two key reasons for this choice.\n\nWeak accept.\n\n3. Supporting arguments\n\nScalable communication with many agents will require a (learned) trade-off between structural priors and learning representations of communicaton (protocols). This work seems like an interesting step in analyzing how to implement this. \n\n4. Additional feedback with the aim to improve the paper. Make it clear that these points are here to help, and not necessarily part of your decision assessment.\n\n5. Questions"}
