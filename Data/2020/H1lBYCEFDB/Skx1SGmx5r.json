It converts the original metric into an approximate metric, whose coordinate representation matches the K-FAC approximation. So K-FAC can be viewed as the exact natural gradient under the new metric rather than an approximation under the Fisher metric.\n\nWhy is the invariance important? How does the proposed framework help us develop better algorithms? Without empirical studies, it is not easy\u00a0to see the significance of this work."}
