The core idea is that it is possible to use (a smaller-dimensional projection of) the Fisher score of the density function defined by the autoregressive model to represent data points in embedding space, and a neural decoder for mapping them back to input space. Experiments on both MNIST and Celeb suggest that this is a sensible method, and leads to smoother interpolations rather than just relying on the embeddings resulting from the network activations.\n\nMinor: the FID acronym on pg. 2 was not introduced beforehand.\n"}
