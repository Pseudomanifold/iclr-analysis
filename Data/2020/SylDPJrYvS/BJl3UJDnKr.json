The reader is referred to an algorithm for the explanation of the method. -No clear motivation for the method is provided in the introduction. \n-Work is not placed in context of lifelong learning literature (continual learning). \n-Text needs still serious editing. Still includes text like [reference of algorithm], and authors do not cite papers correctly (difference between cite and citep)\n-The introduction only dedicates two lines on the proposed method, which were not clear for me. \n-It would be better if the training and evaluation protocol is explained before starting to explain the proposed architecture. What setting of incremental learning are the authors considering?\n"}
