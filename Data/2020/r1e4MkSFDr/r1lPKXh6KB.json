One of ways to deal with this problem is interpolate input signal between data points. In signal processing a standard way to interpolate is to apply a convolution with a kernel. This operation, by itself, is a non-trivial, since we lack any information about signal's spectrum (and do not know optimal kernel). Thus, the authors propose to search for a kernel in a form neural network. To this term they also add bias term which is also a neural network. \n\nBasic idea of the paper seems promising, but reported results are only partial. Since a paper is experimental, i.e. no theory at all, then the main judgement should be based on experimental results. They are not convincing, as CCNN is compared with methods that can not be called state-of-the-art."}
