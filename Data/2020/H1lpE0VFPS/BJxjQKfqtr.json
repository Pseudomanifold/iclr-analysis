The motivation is that there may be multiple different annotations or wrong annotations, especially in case of partial occlusions which make it difficult for the human annotator to precisely define the bounding box.\nTo predict a distribution, Faster RCNN is modified to predict, for each detected object, a mixture of Gaussians for the bounding box, given an initial bounding box for the object. Training is done by optimizing the log-likelihood of the annotations given the predicted mixture-of-Gaussians.\n\nThe method itself is technically sound. My main concern is that I think this paper considers an artificial problem. There is inherently a single valid bounding box for an object. If the annotations are multi-modal, then the solution should be to fix the annotations like the one in  Figure 1d, even if it requires manual work. It is true that it is difficult in practice to annotate exactly a bounding box, as in Figure 1b. However, in this case the annotations are not multimodal. It is reasonable to assume they follow a single Gaussian distribution, and this assumption is actually already made when minimizing a least-squares loss (or a robust version of it) as it is usually done.\n\nThe text has also some small language mistakes, this is however minor.\n"}
