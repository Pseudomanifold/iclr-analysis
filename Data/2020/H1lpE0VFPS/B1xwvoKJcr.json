The authors present the problem formally, describe how the additional parameters can be learned, and show the performance enhancement on a few datasets using their approach.\n\nThe paper tackles the problem of object detection under occlusion in a principled way and the results appear promising. The strong points of the paper:\n1. Clearly written with discussion of how the proposal related to earlier work.\n2. Fairly thorough empirical investigation with several datasets and competitive baselines.\n3. Interesting observations on the qualitative performance of the model.\n\nA couple of concerns:\n1. The work appears somewhat incremental in going from the cited Gaussian model (He et al.) to a multi-variate Gaussian to a mixture of multi-variate Gaussians.\n2. Grammatical error: \u201cmight not as\u201d.\n\nIn summary, I think the paper does a good job of proposing a viable solution to an interesting problem, with my only major concern being its incremental nature. However, the exposition is clear and the results promising, leading me to recommend this paper for acceptance."}
