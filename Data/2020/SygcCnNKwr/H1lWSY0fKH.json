This topic studied in this paper is interesting and is helping to promote the following developing of algorithms with compositional generalization ability.\n2. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed metric for measuring compositional diversity.\n\n\ncomments:\n1. How to control the trade-off between the atom and compositional divergence? It's interesting to show how different\ncompositional divergence can affect the performance of different models.\n2. Many previous works are proposed for improving the generalization ability of the seq2seq models[1]. More experiments need to\nbe conducted using these previous methods.\n\n[1]Compositional generalization in a deep seq2seq model by separating syntax and semantics\n"}
