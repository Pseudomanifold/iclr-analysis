I think this is a worthwhile contribution. My main complaint is that the exposition is a bit diffuse and fails to crystallize the essence of the work. In particular, the claim is that the novelty is from the use of a \"discriminative, multi-modal grounding objective\". Reading the work, this seems to be the triplet loss described in Section 3.5. Is that the novel objective? In my my the really interesting aspect that should be stressed is the visual grounding -- I encourage the authors to highlight that aspect more directly. I fear that essential and interesting point is somewhat diluted in the detailed exposition of results."}
