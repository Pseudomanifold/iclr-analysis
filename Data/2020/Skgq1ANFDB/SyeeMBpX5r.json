The authors showed that the convex relaxation is tight under some general conditions. To be able to use proposed certification and attack convex optimizations, the authors derive global curvature bounds for deep networks with differentiable activation functions. The result is a consequence of a closed-form expression that the paper derived for the Hessian of a deep network. \n\nThe empirical results indicate that the proposed curvature-based robustness certificate outperforms the CROWN certificate by an order of magnitude while being faster to compute as well. Furthermore, adversarial training using the attack method coupled with curvature regularization results in a significantly higher certified robust accuracy than the existing adversarial training methods. \n\n1.  I am not at all familiar with the robustness certification, therefore little knowledge of relevant related works. \n\n2. I hope the authors can provide a more thorough survey of related works. \n\n3. There exist good amount of theoretical analysis in the paper. However all empirical results are only from MNIST. This certainly weakens the method's contribution. \n"}
