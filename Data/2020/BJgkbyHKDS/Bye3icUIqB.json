Specifically, they use Generator trained within the Glow framework as an image prior for de-noising, inpainting and compressed sensing tasks.\nDuring training, a heuristic adjustment to the objective is made allowing optimization of latent variable norm instead of image log likelihood. This seemed critical for convergence of image inverse tasks. The use of Glow prior was shown to be beneficial for all inverse tasks. Experiments were limited to face images from celebA database. While the proposal demonstrates improved empirical performance, it seems to be the only contribution of this paper. Taking an existing model and applying it to a problem where similar extensions have been tried (GAN etc) does not seem quite worthy of a full paper."}
