The authors argue that to optimize the ''proxy for image likelihood'' has two advantages: First, the landscapes of the surface are more smooth; Second, a latent sample point in the regions that have a low likelihood is able to generate desired outcomes. In the experimental analysis, the authors compare their proposed method with several baselines and show prior performance.\n\nThis paper has three major flaws and should be clearly rejected. \nFirst, the novelty of this paper is trivial, in my opinion, the Eq. 2 is the only contribution of this paper.\nSecond, the experimental results are not convincing, almost all the methods proposed after 2015 have better performance compared to these baseline methods.\nThird, there are a lot of claims in this paper have been made without clarification, I have huge troubles in understanding certain sentences.\n "}
