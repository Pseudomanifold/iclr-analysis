The neural acquisition functions are learned using proximal policy optimization in an outer loop on different problems on the same domain, and the learned acquisition function can be deployed at test time in a practically vanilla Bayesian optimization procedure. The authors demonstrate the performance of the method through benchmarks on four problems.\n\nI recommend that this paper be accepted for publication. The paper is well written and it proposes a novel direction for research. However, I think that the authors should look further inside their newly designed acquisition functions, not merely treat them as black boxes. Find below some questions and comments.\n\n\nDue to the inclusion of the sample position x in the state tuple, I am curious as to what the authors think is the difference between their method and a learning-to-learn type of approach. Is the acquisition function learning to favor specific zones in the search space based on previous experiments? Some more experiments or insights on this would be useful to better understand what makes this method succesful.\n\nWhy was a categorical distribution used for the policy? These samples are located in D, aren't you getting rid of information by assuming they are completely independent? Aren't you also biasing the distribution by adding the local maxima to the set of \u03be (Xi)?\n\nAlso, the right-most block in Figure 1 shows a continuous probability distribution, which is incorrect. If the distribution is indeed categorical, there is no continuity between points.\n\n\nMinor mistakes:\n\n- page 5, paragraph 3: \"This choice does not penalize explorative evaluations which do not yield and immediate improvement\" should read \"an immediate improvement\"\n- Figure 4b, MetaBO-50 is missing"}
