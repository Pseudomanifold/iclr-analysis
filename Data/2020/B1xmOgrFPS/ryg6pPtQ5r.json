The problem is addressed in the learning scheme of meta-learning paradigm: the proposed meta-rcnn trains the popular faster-rcnn on several tasks of few shots object detection while the RPN and the object classification networks are meta-learned among the tasks. Compared to previous work the paper introduces the meta learning framework and several changes to the faster rcnn detector. A prototype representation is derived from the standard RPN network and its proposed bounding box. An attention mechanism choose the object of interest and is used to train the final RPN and classification network. Experiments on the popular Pascal Voc 2007 and ImageNet-FSOD show that the proposed system have state of the art performance.\n\nThe paper is very well written, easy to read and of excellent presentation. The introduction of the meta learning paradigm and its use to learn the RPN and classification networks are incremental in novelty but interesting. The experiments are solid and show state of the art performance. As a result I recommend this paper to be accepted.\n\nMinor issues:\n- in caption of Fig1: avialable -> available\n- in 4.1: \u201cCompared to other variants...\u201d please add a reference to the specific methods you are comparing to."}
