Following that, the paper investigates how to estimate local and global adversarial robustness using an estimator based on evaluating these quantities on the empirical distribution. Using a Chernoff bound, the papers evaluate probabilistic bounds on the deviation of the estimated quantities from the true quantities.  Finally, simulations are provided to evaluate these bounds for examples.\n\nComments:\n\nThe authors' insistence on their contribution being proving measurability does not make sense -- of course everything is measurable! Furthermore, the formal definitions or local and global robustness are well-known, the bounds in Theorems 1 and 2 are not novel and highly unlikely to be tight. The redeeming aspect of the paper is the experiments, where the authors show that these bounds can actually be (approximately) calculated. However, I feel that merely experimental results with correct but not significant theoretical contributions does not meet the bar for acceptance. "}
