It is a lot of work and it is reasonably written. The problem is that a fair bit of it is quite basic: for example the measurability property is very much expected -- noone was doubting it, and the proof is more of a formality than a contribution. Similarly with the statistical sampling: the method seems to rely on i.i.d. sampling -- has this reviewer missed any important details? If not, then it's only the bounds that are a contribution, but the method is not. We would appreciate more specific description of the main contribution, without it we cannot recommend the acceptance of this paper."}
