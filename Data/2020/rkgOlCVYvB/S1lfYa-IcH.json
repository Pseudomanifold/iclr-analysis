They introduced a distinction between \"pure\" and \"spurious\" critical points. They showed that for quadratic loss, there are no spurious local minimum in both the filling and non-filling case. For other convex loss, there are no spurious local minimum in the filling case, but there are spurious local minimum in the non-filling case. They gave a precise description of the number of topologically connected components of the variety of global minima. \n\nMy concern to this paper is that the landscape of linear neural networks, which is the subject of this paper, has already been analyzed in the literature. The final results of this paper, though derived using a different approach, are not new. Another limitation of this paper is, the approach of algebraic geometry used in the analysis seems hard to be generalized to non-linear multi-layers neural networks. \n\nA contribution of this paper is that the viewpoint of pure and spurious critical points made the landscape results of linear neural networks more intuitive. However, I don't have the expertise to assess whether this viewpoint was implicitly contained in the proof of previous results. Given this, I am not sure the contribution of this paper is enough for ICLR. \n\nI don't hold a strong opinion, since there could potentially be great ideas inside the algebraic geometry tools. \n"}
