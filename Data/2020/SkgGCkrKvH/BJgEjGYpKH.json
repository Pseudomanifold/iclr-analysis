It is well motivated and well written. The authors consider CHOCO-SGD for non-convex decentralized optimization and establish the convergence result based on the compression ratio. This result does not rely on specific quantized method and main term in the upper bound matches with the centralized baseline. The authors also show CHOCO-SGD with momentum is effectiveness in practical. The experimental results on several benchmark datasets validate the algorithm achieves better performance than baselines\n\nBoth of the theoretical and empirical results are convincing. I believe this paper is ready for publication.\n\nMinor comments:\n\n1. It is prefer to present Algorithm 2 and 3 in the main text, since they are mentioned by the statement of Theorem 4.1 and used in experiments respectively.\n\n2. Can you provide some theoretical guarantee of CHOCO-SGD with momentum?\n"}
