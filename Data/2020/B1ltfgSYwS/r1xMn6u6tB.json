They have presented a meta-learning approach that requires only few data examples from only one class to adapt to unseen tasks. The proposed method builds upon the model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) algorithm. I think the topic itself is interesting and I have the following concerns.\n(1) The first is about the real requirement of this learning scenario. Although the authors have pointed out some real applications, I think they have been introduced separated. In other words, since this setting is the combination of two previous areas, i.e., one class classification and few-shot learning, I fell that the authors have introduced it by just a combination. What are the unique challenges of this problem? I think these problems should be clarified at first.\n(2) The second one is the algorithms itself. Although I have not checked the details, I fell that the authors have prepared this paper in a rough way. The authors have only described the method, without deep analyses answering the question why. For example, the method seems heuristic, without theoretical analysis. In summary, I think this paper likes a technical report, not a research paper.\n(3) Although I can catch the main meaning of this paper, it seems that the writing style is not so fluently. I suggested the authors to recognize the presentation.\n"}
