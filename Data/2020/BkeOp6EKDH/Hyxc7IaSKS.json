The technique is reminiscent of t-SNE, with the difference that it get weighted triplets (i,j,k) as inputs (meaning that j is closer to i thank). Further a loss function is defined which directly follows t-SNE ideology.\n\nA paper is purely experimental. The only way to judge the quality of its results is to compare 2D pictures of TriMap with other pictures. I did not see any evidence that images of TriMap somehow give a new insight into data (in comparison with other methods)."}
