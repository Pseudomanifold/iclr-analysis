The meta sampler adopted a NIAF structure to generate meta samples, while the sample adapter adapts the samples based on optimal-transport Bayesian sampling. \n\nWhat is the advantage of this Bayesian meta learning methods comparing to the popular none Bayesian methods?  It seems the performance of this Bayesian method is inferior to the state-of-the-art meta-learning methods. What are the specific model structures for T and G in NIAF?\n\nThe experiments can be improved.  First, the comparison methods didn\u2019t appear in all the results. For example, why PMAML is not compared with in Figure 3, Table 1 and Table 2? \nSecond, for the standard meta-learning tasks in Table 3, it is better to compare with the state-of-the-art methods. "}
