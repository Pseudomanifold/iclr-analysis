The authors show that the changes of likelihood of an image computed by flow-based image generative models have surprisingly weak correlations with semantic changes of image. The flow likelihoods are sensitive to very small changes of pixels that do not affect the semantics of an image. And the likelihoods are less robust against out-of-distribution inputs where we expect strong robustness compared to discriminative models. \nThese claims are validated and supported by several simple experimental results. \n\nThis is an interesting paper: it warns the abuse of likelihoods computed by flow models with several numerical experiments, which are simple but clearly designed to support the claims. \nThese experimental results convince me that the likelihoods of flow-based image generative models are joint distributions of pixel intensities and it is natural such likelihoods are apt to be sensitive in pixel intensity changes, even if they are semantically meaningless. \n\nDesigns of experiments are apparently similar to those of (Nalisnick+, 2018) at the first glance.  I think there is a room to improve the manuscript to clarify the difference from the Nalisnick+\u2019s work. My understanding is that (Nalinsnick+, 2018) is interested in the OOD likelihood behaviors when datasets are swapped, and explains the behaviors of OOK likelihood based on the variance and the curvature of the dataset. This paper directly manipulates the pixel intensities so small that the statistics of the images would not change. \nBTW, the Nalisnick\u2019s paper is accepted and published in ICLR 2019. \n\nIt is a well-known fact that the flow (glow) models can generate natural and high-resolution images by interpolating ``latent hidden vectors\u2019\u2019. This indicates the latent representations are robust against perturbations while pixel intensities are not. So, when this transition of robustness occurs? This seems an interesting problem for me. I\u2019m happy to hear the authors\u2019 opinions about this issue. \n \nSummary\n+ Good research question concerning the robustness of flow models\n+ Simple and understandable claims supported by simple experiments\n+ Easy to read\n- Can be improved more to clarify the difference from the previous work that study the flow model\u2019s likelihoods. \n"}
