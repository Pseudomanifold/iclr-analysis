The essential basis for the metric is to rank the models based on how much disentanglement they provide. This method relies on a key observation from this paper [A] viz., disentangled representations by any VAE-based model are likely to be similar (upto permutation and sign).\n\nI am inclined to accept the paper for the following reasons:\n1. The proposed approach is clear and easy enough to understand and well motivated\n2. The paper has clearly outlined the assumptions and limitations of their work\n3. The reported result show that models ranked by disentanglement correlate well with the supervised metrics for the various VAE models.\n4. This metric is unsupervised and thus can utilize far more data than the supervised metric methods and can be useful even when the dataset has no labels.\n5. The supplementary material also shows that the metric correlates well with the task performance.\n\n[A] Variational Autoencoders Pursue PCA Directions (by Accident), CVPR 2019"}
