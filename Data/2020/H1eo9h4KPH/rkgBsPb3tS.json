The result in Theorem 1 is similar to Theorem 3 in [1]. The authors use McShane\u2013Whitney extension theorem [2] to generalize the previous result, which is a trivial derivation.\n2. Although the proposed method is theoretically applicable for a wide class of models, it is hard to use in practice, since the Lipschitz constant is too hard to compute exactly. To address the problem, the authors give an approach to approximate the Lipschitz constant for product kernels efficiently. However, the applicability of the method is still limited if it can be used only for product kernels.\n3. In the abstract, the authors claim that this paper resolves the previous methods' limitations for deep neural networks. However, there is no corresponding theoretical analysis.\n4. Some notations are confusing. For example, in the second paragraph on Page 3, there are two different sets denote $cost_c$; in the definition of $cost_c(\\mu,\\nu)$, the meaning of the symbol $\\Pi$ is unclear; in Theorem 2, the symbol $|\\cdot|$ is not defined.\n\n[1] Aman Sinha, Hongseok Namkoong, and John Duchi.
