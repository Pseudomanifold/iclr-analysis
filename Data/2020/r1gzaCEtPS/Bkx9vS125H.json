This is done through posterior regularization within an amortized structured variational framework. The method is evaluated on two problems: text generation and unsupervised tagging.\n\nThe paper is well written with sufficient details. The experiments are very detailed. I especially appreciate the discussions of the limitations.\n\nNote that the paper is half a page over the limit and should be shortened. That said, I don't see that as being a problem. "}
