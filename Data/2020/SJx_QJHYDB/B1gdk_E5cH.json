They conduct most of experiments on ImageNet and results show that winning ticket is robust, and few data samples can also obtain good winning tickets.\n\nGenerally, the paper has conducted extensive experiments on three open questions and results prove their assumptions.\n\nAs describe in page 7, lottery tickets are sensitive to data distributions. I\u2019m wondering, whether there will be winning ticket for multi-task learning with limited data each task? Will this be helpful in distilling the model?"}
