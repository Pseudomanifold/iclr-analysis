Using self training is not new in GCN but the way it is used here, computing adaptively a threshold for incorporating pseudo labels and using weights according to the confidence off predictions is new.\n\nExperimental results are reported on citation datasets and compared with many baselines show similar results as baselines when the coverage increases up to 50 labeled nodes /class, but the method brings significant improvements when the coverage is low (e.g. only few, <20, labels /class). \n\nAlthough the difference with previous approaches do not look like a huge step, the method seems to be quite justified empirically and achieve real good results wrt state of the art."}
