It's a valuable improvement upon variational inference, it's novel, and the derivations are correct. The presentation is elaborate and covers all expected aspects. The literature review is up to date. \nThe experimental results are diverse enough and convincing. The authors have considered both proof of concept experiments and deep learning architectures. The comparisons are valid. \n"}
