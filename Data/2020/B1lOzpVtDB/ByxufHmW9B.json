The model maps words from the input utterance to the concepts/nodes in the knowledge graph. The model then uses an attention mechanism to condition on relevant parts of the graph (e.g., nodes in the vicinity of the concepts identified in the input) and the input utterance to generate a response.\n\nI found the problem tackled in this paper to be very interesting.  Incorporating external knowledge seems essential for tasks such as dialog and Q&A. The model also seems to perform fairly well compared to the proposed baselines. However, I found that the ideas in the paper could be better exposed. In particular, I found the description of the model to be quite difficult to follow (please see detailed comments below). I also found that seemingly relevant work was not discussed or not discussed in great depth. For example, very recent work learn how to build a graph from text (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.08435.pdf). I would also like the authors to better explain how their work differs from other recent similar work.  \n\nOverall, I find it difficult to evaluate the quality of the contribution with the current manuscript. \n\n\nDetailed comments: \n- I found that several terms were used without being properly defined.  E.g., common sense knowledge graph, grounded knowledge. I think that defining these early would strengthen the introduction. \n- Figure 1 is useful but I suggest to expand the caption to explain how the figure. I also found that it would be useful to include G^0, G^1, and G^2 in it. I would also suggest adding a second figure that shows the actual model (e.g., including its layers). The current Figure 1 only contains the attention weight/scores. \n- In Tables 1, 2, and especially 3, could you provide the variability of the estimators?\n- In Figure 2, perhaps these would be better illustrated as bar plots?  Also, I'm not sure why you connect the performance of the different models. \n- In the Ablation study, what is the number of random examples in the Gold method and how did you choose it? It seems a bit arbitrary and it seems like this value will greatly affect the results of this method. If I understand correctly I would suggest removing altogether this method. \n- In related work, there is a single paragraph (3rd) on work that explores similar tasks. I think it would be nice to survey work on graph construction from data (e.g., OpenIE) as well as text generation from graphs. \n- The title of the paper is perhaps somewhat misleading since this model is really meant for response generation and not multi-turn conversations (the latter would likely require to keep the previous grounded concepts around). \n"}
