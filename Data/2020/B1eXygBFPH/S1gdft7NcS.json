Most attacks on graphs can be easily identified [1].  This paper argues that if one rewires the graph (instead of adding/deleting nodes/edges) such that the top eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix are only slightly perturbed then the attacker can go undetected.  \n\nThe paper should address the following issues:\n\n1. There is no discussion on tracking the path capacity of the graph as measured by the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix and the eigengaps between the largest in module eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix .  Rewiring often affects the path capacity even if one makes sure the degree distribution is the same and restricts the rewiring to 2-hop neighbors.\n\n2. Rewiring affects edge centrality and so one needs to show that the proposed algorithm doesn't change the distribution over edge centrality.\n\n3. In social networks, the highest eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix are very close to each other because of all the triangles.  The paper will be stronger if it included how the proposed method performs under various random graph models -- e.g., Gnp random graph, preferential attachment, and small-world.\n\nMiscellaneous notes:\n\n- The captions for the figures should be more informative.\n\n- Table 2 should list more characteristics of the graphs such as number of nodes, number of edges, exponent of the degree distribution, global clustering coefficient, average clustering coefficient, diameter, average path length.\n\n- \"Zgner &Gnnemann\" is misspelled.\n\n- \"As we can observed from the figures, ...\" has a typo in it.\n\n__________________________________________________\n[1]  B.
