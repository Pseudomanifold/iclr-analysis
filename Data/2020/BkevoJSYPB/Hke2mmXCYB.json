The proposed algorithm is tested on path finding, the travelling salesman problem, and a min-cost-perfect-matching problem, with promising results.\n\nI would recommend accepting this paper. It is a well written paper with a novel idea supported by good experimental results.\n\nThe caveat is that I did not have the time to thoroughly review all the mathematical details. From a high-level they looked correct, and the math is sufficiently illustrated with figures and examples that it is easy for a reader to follow in detail given enough time.\n\nThe main shortcomings I see are that there are no experimental results comparing this method against any existing results; the authors do compare against their own ResNet18 implementation, but this is not ideal.\n\nI found the discussion a bit cryptic: Why are approximate solvers needed for real-world problems? Are there no real-world problems where exact solvers are still applicable?"}
