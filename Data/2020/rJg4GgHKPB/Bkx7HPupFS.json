The proposed approach, \"Parameterized Incremental Training\", maintains a reservoir of ground truth-labeled data samples- at each incremental training epoch, performance is tested against these examples, and if accuracy is below a user-specified threshold, the model is fully retrained.\n\nThis setting / motivation is a very relevant one, and the method seems like a sensible start, but neither the proposed approach nor the experimental treatment are substantial or novel enough to warrant acceptance; however hopefully something on this topic and approach- with a more thorough empirical and/or theoretical treatment- will appear later on from these authors!"}
