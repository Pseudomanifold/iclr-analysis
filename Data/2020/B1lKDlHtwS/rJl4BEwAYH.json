Their model assumes the outcomes are constructed by a linear transformation of a set of true causes plus measurement noise. Specifically, they fit the model Y=(XE+N)F, where X are the predictors, E is a binary matrix indicating the true causes, N is a noise term, and F is a mixing term. They provide a closed form solution the model fit based on a pair of l2-regularized regressions. They simulate from the given model and provide comparisons against least-squares regression, canonical correlation analysis, and partial least squares. They also apply the method to brain imaging data containing 102 individuals reading 120 sentences plus scrambled sentences, with the goal of inferring which features of the words have an effect on imaging results.\n\nThis paper appears to be technically sound, but it should be rejected based on 1) the relatively limited applicability of the model and 2) a lack of thorough experimentation indicating that this is an appropriate method under more general circumstances. It is odd that the model assumes the outcomes are measured without error. Instead, it is assumed that the causes are measured with error, and mixed via F. A more appropriate model may be: Y=(XE+N)F+M, where an additional noise term M allows for Y to be measured imprecisely. Viewed in this light, the model starts to look a lot like canonical correlation analysis. Consider a model Y=ZF+M, X=ZG+N, if dim(Z) = dim(X) and G is invertible, this can be re-written as Y=(X inv(G)-N)A+M, and we arrive at a similar model with specific restrictions about the structure of inv(G) (E will in general not be invertible, so they are not the same). It is particularly odd, then, that the authors do no comparisons against any regularized form of CCA, which would seem to be the most natural method to use in this circumstance. Moreover, in the simulations where they show B2B outperforms CCA, they use 1000 training samples with 10-100 possible causes. In their experiments on real data, where it seems the CCA results are much closer to the results that B2B gives, they have 2700 samples and 4 possible causes. This seems to imply the real data case might be better conditioned than the simulated case, so that regularization would have less of an impact.\n\nIn conclusion, the authors present a sound method for disentangling correlated possible causes when the outcome is high-dimensional. However, the authors do not provide enough evidence that this method is generally useful and better than established methods to merit acceptance to ICLR. A comparison to regularized CCA, application to more datasets and simulations under violations of the model would greatly improve the paper. I also have two minor points. 1) the word \u201ccausal\u201d can mean many things, and here it refers specifically to disentangling correlated predictors, rather than confounding in observations or direction of effect. It would improve the paper to add some discussion of this point. 2) The comparisons in the experiments are done between E estimated from B2B and E=sum_j H_j^2 for other methods that do not directly estimate E. However, a more natural comparison might be against EF as this also includes estimates of the strength of influence of each observation, which is implicit in the sum above.\n"}
