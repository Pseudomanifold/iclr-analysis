Furthermore, this work theoretically shows the consistency of B2B and the experiments also verify the effectiveness of this approach.\n\nThe writing is well and clear and there are some minors issues:\n- Further analysis and explanation for using \\hat{E}=Diag(H)to estimate the causal influence might be needed.\n- The model defined in Fig. 1 seems the influence E should have a sparse diagonal vector. It is possible to introduce an L1 regulation in E?"}
