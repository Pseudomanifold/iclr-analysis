The weight is adjusted by a simple heuristic during the training. Experimental results show that the BTD3 algorithm outperforms TD3, SAC, DDPG on six MuJoCo environments.\n\nHow to get accurate function approximations is a very important problem. The idea that using a weight to balance the target value from CDQ and the target value from the single critic is welled motivated and interesting. Figure 1 gives a good motivation example to show how BCDQ reduces the estimator error of Q value. I appreciate that the authors plot the detail of beta in the training in Figure 2. \n\nThe experimental results are somewhat weak as there are no results on Swimmer and HumanoidStandup. And I do not think BTD3 significantly outperforms other baselines in Ant, Walker2d, and Reacher. The paper would be more convincing with the result of BTD3 with fixed beta in Figure 1.\n\nQuestions:\n1. Are there any statistics of the estimation errors of TD3, DDPG, and BTD3 in all environments?\n\n"}
