Importantly, these experiments are designed to run fast enough that one can benchmark a new algorithm within a reasonable amount of time (and money). They can thus be seen as a \u00ab test suite \u00bb for RL, limited to small toy problems but very useful to efficiently debug RL algorithms and get an overview of some of their key properties. The paper describes the motivation behind bsuite, shows detailed results from some classical RL algorithms on a couple of experiments, and gives a high-level overview of how the code is structured.\n\nI really believe such a suite of RL tasks can indeed be extremely useful to RL researchers developing new algorithms, and as a result I would like to encourage this initiative and see it published at ICLR to help it gain additional traction within the RL community.\n\nThe paper is easy to read, motivates well the reasons behind bsuite, and shows some convincing examples. However, in my opinion there remain a few important issues with this submission:\n\n1.\tThere is no \u00ab related work \u00bb section to position bsuite within the landscape of RL benchmarks (ex: DMLab, ALE / MinAtar, MuJoCo tasks, etc.). I believe it is important to add one.\n\n2.\tThe current collection of experiments appears to be quite limited. The authors acknowledge the lack of hierarchical RL, but what about other aspects like continuous control, parameterized actions, multi-agent, state representation learning, continual learning, transfer learning, imitation learning / inverse RL, self-play, etc? It is unclear to me whether the goal is to grow bsuite in all these directions (and more) over time, or if there is some kind of \u00ab boundary \u00bb the authors have in mind regarding the scope of bsuite. Regardless, the fact is that in its current form, bsuite appears to be suited only to a limited subset of current RL research.\n\n3.\tI wish an anonymized version of the code had been provided, so that reviewers could test it. In particular I wonder (a) if it is easy to setup and run under Windows, and (b) if it is straighforward to plug a bsuite experiment within an algorithm based on the popular OpenAI gym API (I think the latter is true from what is said at the end of Section 4, but I would have appreciated being able to try it out myself).\n\nAdditional minor remarks:\n\u2022\tI noticed two anoymity-related issues with the provided links: (1) the Google Colab notebook revealed to me the name of its author when clicking the \u00ab Open in Playground \u00bb link to be able to run it, and (2) the bsuite-tutorial link asks for permission, which might let the authors access reviewer info. I would not hold it against the authors though as I believe these are genuine mistakes and they did their best to preserve anonymity.\n\u2022\tt > 2 in Section 2.1 should probably be t >= 2\n\u2022\tIn FIg. 2b the label for the y axis seems incorrect since good results are near 0\n\u2022\tPlease explain what is the dashed grey line in Fig. 4b\n\u2022\tI was unable to understand the last 2 sentences of Section 4\n\u2022\tSections C.2, D.2 and E.2 all have the same plots\n\u2022\tA few typos: incomplete sentence near bottom of p.3 (\u00ab the internal workings\u2026 \u00bb), \u00ab These assessment \u00bb, \u00ab expeirments \u00bb, \u00ab recurrant \u00bb, \u00ab length ? 1 \u00bb, \u00ab together with an analysis parses this data \u00bb, \u00ab anonimize \u00bb, \u00ab bsuite environments by implementing \u00bb, \u00ab even if require \u00bb"}
