The authors report practical improvements compared to pure strategies computed as proposed by Tessler et al.\n\nDecision\nThe idea of using randomized strategies for two-player reinforcement learning is interesting and natural. However, as the authors note, mixed strategies are classical in game theory. Furthermore, the adaption of the methodology of hsieh et al is straightforward, limiting the strength of the theoretical contribution. \nUnfortunately, the theoretical contribution is not stated consistently, since in the introduction, the paper states \"Our paper precisely bridges this gap between theory and practice in previous works, by proposing the \ufb01rst theoretically convergent algorithm for robust RL\", but this claim is missing in the abstract or conclusion, and there is no theorem that justifies this rather strong claim. \nIn my opinion, this paper should only be accepted if it provides very convincing numerical experiments, which I am not qualified to assess. I happy to increase my score if the experimental results are deemed strong by the reviewers with more expertise in practical reinforcement learning.\n\nQuestions to authors\nYou write \"Our paper precisely bridges this gap between theory and practice in previous works, by proposing the \ufb01rst theoretically convergent algorithm for robust RL\". What is the exact mathematical statement here? Does this refer to the algorithm that is used in the numerical experiments?"}
