The authors propose that the optimization is done using Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics iterations. \nIn my opinion, the use of SGLD to this problem is potentially useful - as partially proved by this work. However, this application is obvious and does not have enough novelty merits to be accepted to this ICLR. The experiment make senses but is not rigorous enough to assure the practitioners on the improvement over baseline. \nI recommend the authors to further develop this idea in both theoretical improvement and experiment settings to further explore the direction."}
