However, I find the rather vaguely stated motivations for L_MIM uncompelling.  L_MIM does not bound (1) nor does it bound or estimate mutual information.  A lack of any compelling motivation could be overlooked if the empirical results where compelling.  But the empirical evaluation is very shallow with a focus on MNIST and similar data sets.\n\nA technical comment is that I do not understand how z_i is generated in equation (12).  What distribution are the pairs (x_i,z_i) being drawn from?  I should note, however, that this technicality is not my main issue with the paper and will not influence my judgement."}
