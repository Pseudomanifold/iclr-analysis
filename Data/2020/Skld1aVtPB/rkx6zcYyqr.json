They further use this method to detect effects of the same adversarial perturbation algorithm over a set of images.\nMajor comments:\nOverall this is quite interesting work, and seems like a promising method to detect groups of anomalies. However, this work is not complete without comparison to existing methods, the lack of which makes it impossible to evaluate its usefulness. See [1,2].\n\nMinor questions/comments:\nThe results seem to be applied to ReLU activation networks and anomalous signals are described as having higher activation that the background or the clean images. Could you clear up whether this method works for all activations or just ReLU networks?\nI\u2019m envisioning a case where the anomalous images are all anomalous because they are all very similar. If I put 100 of the same (or very similar images) would this be something that this method could detect?\nYour results seem to suggest that adversarial perturbation methods produce adversarial images with activations that are more extreme than natural images. This doesn\u2019t seem immediately obvious to me and I would be interested in further exploration of this direction.\nA value of \\epsilon=0.02 was used in experiments for BIM. While I agree that smaller values of \\epsilon are harder to detect it would be useful to have an evaluation of performance over smaller values of \\epsilon even if these did not perform as well.\n[1] Xiong, L., P \u0301oczos, B., Schneider, J., Connolly, A., VanderPlas, J.: Hierarchical probabilistic models for group anomaly detection.
