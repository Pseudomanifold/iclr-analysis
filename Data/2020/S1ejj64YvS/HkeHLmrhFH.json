One main contribution in the paper is to use optimal transport to achieve a tighter ELBO in the proposed framework.\n\nMy main concern is that it appears in the paper the authors are trying to use a linear transport to approximate the intractable posterior distribution p(z|X) and p(c|X). I am not sure how this can be achieved and there is no discussions in the paper about this or how to reduce the approximation errors.\n\n"}
