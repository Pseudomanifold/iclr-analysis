There have been various trials of GAN-TTS but not so many success and I'm glad to hear that the proposed method seems to enable GAN-TTS with fast inference thanks to the non-autoregressive property. The method also proposes new objective measures inspired by the image recognition network based on the high-level features generated by end-to-end ASR, which is also another important contribution of this paper. \n\nMy concern for this paper is reproducibility. Although I really appreciate the authors' efforts on providing implementational details in the appendix, the code and data do not seem to be publicly available, and I'm expecting that the implementation of this technique is relatively hard due to their complex designs of the generator and discriminator. Apart from that, the paper is well written overall by well describing the trend of GAN studies in the image processing and the application of such image processing oriented GAN techniques to TTS."}
