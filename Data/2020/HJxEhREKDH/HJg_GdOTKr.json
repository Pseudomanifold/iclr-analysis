They first establish a global convergence of GD/SGD under some conditions on the fixed linear transformations. They they showed that for Gaussian random input and output transformation, global convergence still holds under conditions on the width of networks strictly milder than the literature. Linear convergence rate of SG/SGD are also established.\n\nThe paper is well written. The results seem novel and interesting.\n\nIt would be nice if the authors can give intuition why the input and output layer transformations need to be fixed in the analysis. What if happen if these matrices vary along the optimization process?"}
