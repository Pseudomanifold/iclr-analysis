Based on EHP, the paper develops depthwise separable convolution to compress CNNs, and extend it to a rank-k approach with further improved accuracy. Some analysis is provided about the operation equivalence. The experiments on standard benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of the method. \n\nProbably the most important contribution of this work is that it proposes a new operation that can summarize/generalize the existing depthwise separable convolution and reveal the relationship with the standard convolution. The work is meaningful to me because a compact representation of CNNs can largely reduce the computational resources and storage.  \nThe experiments are extensive as well. "}
