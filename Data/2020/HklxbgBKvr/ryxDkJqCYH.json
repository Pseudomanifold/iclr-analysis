This is a difficult combinatorial optimization problem because of the difficulty in optimizing over a combinatorially large space. The authors propose a RL based framework for this black box optimization problem.\n\nThe paper is well written, but I have questions about the efficacy of the method, particularly because I think some of these results are against weak baselines. For example, the authors don't compare against many better performing protein design methods (See: Ingraham et. al, GENERATIVE   MODELS   FOR   GRAPH-BASED   PROTEIN DESIGN, Sabban et. al, RamaNet: Computational De Novo Protein Design using a Long Short-Term Memory Generative Adversarial Neural Network). VAE based methods have worked well for designing sequences like SMILES strings, but the authors dismiss them claiming that they are better modelled as molecular graphs. While it could be true that molecules are better modeled as molecular graphs, it is not clear why methods that have worked well in a sequence based modeling using SMILES strings will not work for Protein Design. For AMP Design, again they compare with a weak baseline and don't compare with VAE based methods (like for example: Das et al. PepCVAE: Semi-Supervised Targeted Design of Antimicrobial Peptide Sequences)"}
