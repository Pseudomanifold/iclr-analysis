In particular, it proposes to (a) switch the loss function for stereo deep networks from disparity to depth (b) do the stereo cost volume analysis in a depth volume (via resampling) rather than disparity volume and (c) if sparse lidar is available, align the estimated depth with the sparse lidar. Each seems to improve results, and the resulting\u00a0system\u00a0achieves good results\u00a0on KITTI and outperforms past work in this area.\n\nPositives:\n+The paper proposes three ideas that seem good and lead to improvements that are demonstrated empirically.\n+The paper is well written\u00a0\n+The experiments are exceptionally thorough\n+The ideas seems to me to be of obvious importance, although I realize that I'm likely not qualified to make a statement about this, and this should perhaps be done by a roboticist.\u00a0\n\nNegatives:\n-Most of the heavy lifting in the case without sparse LIDAR is done by tweaking the loss function rather than the cost, although the remaining gain is still pretty good\n-I am not sure if this is a negative, but this is really a 3D vision paper. I do some form of 3D vision, but I really don't feel confident about my ability to assess whether doing stereo matching in a depth cost volume as opposed to disparity is correct -- I really haven't worked on stereo. It seems to work well, but I feel as if the wrong people are being asked to review the paper. I leave questions of venue to the area chair though.\n\nOverall, I am inclined to accept the paper. I am a tiny bit worried about venue and whether the right people will check the work, but I don't think this should be decided by reviewers. However, I think the experiments are quite thorough and the paper is clearly above the bar.\n\nIn more detail:\n\nMethod:\n+The method reads quite well and the idea is clean. I particularly like the graph-based depth correction algorithm, and the LLE-like way of adjusting the estimated depthmap. I have a few small comments below that do not affect my judgment, but I think would improve the paper.\n= Small thought: the words systematic bias throughout is primarily referring to a bias for a particular object as opposed to a bias of the system (i.e., any individual object is too far or too close). This seems non-standard to me. A systematic bias would be that everything's too far away by 1m for instance.\n\nExperiments:\n+The experiments are exceptionally thorough, and of my pile of ICLR papers, this by far has the most thorough and well-thought-out experimental analysis.\n+The system shows systematic improvements on 3 different LIDAR-based object detection systems; I think this is great.\n=I'm not sure whether the 64-beam LIDAR can be subsampled to imitate 4-beam LIDAR. I simply don't know enough about the hardware to know if this is a sensible approximation.\u00a0\n-Table 3 primarily suggests that the vast majority of the hard work in the non-sparse LIDAR is done by the depth loss rather than the depth cost volume. The resulting change is still pretty good (although I suspect that if you stuck in a coordconv in the disparity cost volume, it would handle the fact that you want unequal smoothing).\n-The burial of the results on depth prediction results in the appendix with one is a little surprising as is the solitary table on it, but I understand the need to focus on 3D detection.\n\nSmall stuff that doesn't affect my review:\n1) Framing the problem as having ethical considerations is, in my view, not necessary -- should all network compression papers start arguing that it is of profound ethical importance to figure out your bit quantization?\u00a0\n2) Last paragraph above Section 4 \"gird\" -> \"Grid\"\n3) Figure 3 caption \"pruple\" -> \"purple\"\n4) Figure 4 is suboptimal -- I assume SDN+GDC < SDN < Disparity Net, but this is hard to verify.\n5) Calling the network \"Disparity Net\" is a bit of an issue given that there's DispNet already\u00a0\n6) \"Figure 1 illustrates beautifully how\" -> Please don't editorialize like this"}
