Instead of imposing equal weights on all possible queries, the proposed framework considers giving larger weights on queries having larger inner product values. The authors shows that this derives a loss function having different weights on parallel and orthogonal component of residual of quantization. The paper shows the performance of the algorithm mainly by using the Glove1.2M dataset.\n\nThe basic idea and the weighting approach would be reasonable. Empirical evaluation might be slightly weak.\n\nIn practice, how can the hyper-parameter (T and b) be determined? T = 0.2 shows the best performance on Fig. 2 (b), but its seems sensitive, and generality of this setting is not clear.\n\nIn (7), only <q,x> larger than T is penalized, but larger <q,\\tidel{x}> seems important as well. If the encoded \\tilde{x} has a large inner product value wrongly, it would deteriorate performance.\n\nThe tightness of the the upper bound of the inequality in the end of page 4 would be unclear. Replacing norm with its possible maximum value seemingly has large effect.\n\nMinor comment:\nFigure 1 is not referred from the main text.\n\nIn Fig. 2 (b), reconstruction and proposed have the save value at T = 0.1. Is this just a coincident?"}
