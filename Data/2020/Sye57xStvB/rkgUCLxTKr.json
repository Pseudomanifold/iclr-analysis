For achieving that, the authors propose a count-based NGU agent, combining intrinsic and extrinsic bonuses as new rewards. An extrinsic/ long-term novelty module is used to control the amount of exploration across episodes, a life-long curiosity factor as its output. In the intrinsic/episodic novelty module, an embedding net and a KNN on episodic memory are applied to compute the current episodic reward. In the experiment, a universal value function approximator (UVFA) framework is used to simultaneously approximate the optimal value function with a set of rewards. The proposed method is tested on several hard exploration games. Other recent count-based models are compared in the paper.\n\nCons:\n- To my acknowledge, the task and the count-based methods are not too novel. \n- They use 35 billion environment frames.\n\nOverall, this paper is well-written. Methods and results are clearly described.\n"}
