Essentially two competing pressures that push agents to explore as many novel states in a single rollout as possible and to explore as many states as possible as evenly as possible. The primary contribution here is the episodic novelty measure, which relies on a state embedding that takes into account stochasticity in the environment. The paper covers this episodic curiosity measure and how it\u2019s integrated with the life-long curiosity metric. It then demonstrates the impact of these metrics and variations compared to baselines on particular games and all 57 Arcade Learning Environment games.\n\nThis is a clear accept. This paper demonstrates a novel episodic curiosity metric and a means of integrating that with a more standard life-long curiosity metric. The writing is clear and the results are good and well-explained. \n\nI would appreciate in the final paper some discussion of whether it would be possible to adjust the hyper-parameters of the approach during training, given that different variations of the approach seemed to do consistently better or worse as the authors described. Further, I would have appreciated a summarization of the limitations towards the end of the paper. \n\nI recognize that the life-long curiosity approach is fairly arbitrary, but given that the controllable state is already available, I\u2019m not sure why it isn\u2019t used for this measure. It seems naively it would be helpful. If not, some clarity on this would be appreciated."}
