First, the application is starightforward application of BO to the well-known problem of adversarial perturbation. Nothing innovative. Second, the paper addresses the high dimensional optimisation with simple upsampling technique like nearest-neighbour, without even trying their hands dirty by using one of many many high-dimensional Bayesian optimisation algorithm (a quick Google search will reveal them), The work  thus fail in thoroughness also. Third, adversarial perturbation are known to exist even around the image such that even a simple gradient descet optimisation starting from the target image would be able to provide perceptually small perturbation (it does not have to the smallest to be perceptually small). Hence, the impact is also missing. Thus accroding to me this paper is not good enough for acceptance. "}
