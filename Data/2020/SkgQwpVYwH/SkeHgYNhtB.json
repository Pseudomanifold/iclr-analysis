The authors suggest that deep neural frameworks can be applied in this framework for sample elicitation through the derivations. The authors also show the connection between the problem of sample elicitation and f-GAN. However, some problems in the proof on sample elicitation should be clarified or carefully explained.\n\n- In (C.15) in Section C.7, why the upper bound is irrelevant to y or W_L^1 or W_L^2? Since we do not have W_L^1 = W_L^2, how to derive the inequality in (C.15)?\n\n- In the proof of Lemma B.2 in Section B.5, why 1/(4L_0) and (1/\\mu_0) are simply removed in the inequality below? \n\n- The inequalities in the proof of Theorem 3.5 in Section B.1 should be further explained. What is the meaning of \u201cagent believes p = q\u201d and how to apply this to the lower bound? What is the meaning of \\bar{S} and how to get these inequalities for the upper bound?\n\nSome minor comments\n- The relation of x\u2019 and x in the first paragraph on page 2 should be further clarified, and some formal definition should be given. The readers who are not familiar with this area would be confused about the problem before reading Section 2.1.\n"}
