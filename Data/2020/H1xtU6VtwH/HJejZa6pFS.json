The proposed model consists of two encoders: word encoder and Pinyin encoder. The main contribution of this paper is extending architecture for Pinyin character encoder. In experiments, the authors tested and reported the results on 5 Chinese text datasets.\n\n[Comments]\nI cannot agree with the contributions claimed in this paper for the following reasons:\n- First, the model proposed in the paper is not intuitive and novel. It seems a structure that simply combines existing models. If the proposed model is not simply combined by existing models, the authors need a clear explanation of how each part of the model is intuitively designed.\n- Second, the description and definition of the task are not clear. (The authors need to add a detailed explanation and a clear definition of tasks, including examples.) Also, it would be better to be clear about what problems exist in this task and what the authors want to tackle. \n- Third, (I don't know much Chinese but in general), it doesn't seem natural to be given a Pinyin character. It is considered desirable to learn to infer the meaning of text through context without a pinyin character. In addition, the additional use of the Pinyin character seems to be very equivalent to multi-language tasks and extending seems very straightforward. (I think the multi-language task is more general and natural setting, so I wonder why the authors restrict the problem to Chinese text classification.)\n- In the experiment, only the test error rate is reported, but it is not enough to explain how well the models perform in practical problems. In addition to the test error rate, it would be better to show how practical improvements have been made in real examples."}
