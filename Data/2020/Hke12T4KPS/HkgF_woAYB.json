To assess the forgetting, this paper suggests using the anchor points learned in hindsight. Empirical results show that this formulation performs better than previous methods.\n\n*** Strengths\n1. The idea of using meta-learning to deal with the forgetting issue is interesting. Using anchor points to represent previous tasks is a sensible solution.\n\n2. The comparison with the previous shows that the proposed method performances consistently well on multiple tasks.\n\n\n*** Weakness\n1. The results in Table 3 deserves more discussion. The differences between different anchor are marginal compared with the standard deviations in Table 1. Especially, the result of Data-Anchors and HAL can be treated as the same. I wonder if the authors have any intuition behind this. Basically, this result is not persuasive for the effectiveness of the proposed anchor point learning method. Also, I\u2019m curious to see what would happen if you have oracle access to future tasks which means we don\u2019t need to learn the anchor points in hindsight.\n\n2. The writing can be polished. There are several typos. For example, in the third line of page 3, \u201cand following\u201c might be \u201cfollowing\u201d. In the first line of Section 3, the colon after \u201cstate of the art\u201d should be removed.\n"}
