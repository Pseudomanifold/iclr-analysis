It is well-written, easy to follow and it has a novel idea. The paper covers previous work of art well and introduces the problem. It explains the algorithm well through figures. \nMy only concern is that the paper claims they are improving speed comparing to previous work, but they never compare their work to those mentioned and they don't talk about why there is no comparison provided with previous work of art. Particularly, the algorithm loses some accuracy while detecting adversarial and it is important to know how other algorithms do in a similar scenario."}
