The authors also add tiling trick to make the attack even more efficient. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art attack efficiency in black-box setting.\n\nThe paper indeed presented slightly better results than the current state-of-the-art black-box attacks. It is clearly written and easy to follow, however, the paper itself does not bring much insightful information. \n\nThe major components of the proposed method are two things: using better evolution strategies and using tiling trick. The tiling trick is not something new, it is introduced in (Ilyas et al., 2018) and also discussed in (Moon et al., 2019). The authors further empirically studied the best choice of tiling size. I appreciated that, but will not count it as a major contribution. In terms of better evolution strategies, the authors show that (1+1) and CMA-EA can achieve better attack result but it lacks intuition/explanations why these helps, what is the difference. It would be best if the authors could provide some theories to show the advantages of the proposed method, if not, at least the authors should give more intuition/explanation/demonstrative experiments to show the advantages.\n\nDetailed comments:\n- In section 3.2, is the form of the discretized problem a standard way to transform from continuous to discrete one? What is the intuition of using a and b? Have you considered using only one variable to do it?\n- In section 3.3.2 what do you mean by \u201cwith or without softmax, the optimum is at infinity\u201d? I hope the authors could further explain it.\n- In eq (2), do you mean  max_{\\tau} L(f(x + \\epsilon tanh(\\tau)), y) ?\n- In section 3.3.1, the authors said (1+1)-ES and CMA-ES can be seen as an instantiation of NES. Can the authors further elaborate on this?\n- Can the authors provide algorithm for DiagonalCMA?\n- It is better to put the evolution strategy algorithms in the main paper and discuss it. \n- Can the authors also comment/compare the results with the following relevant paper?\nLi, Yandong, et al. \"NATTACK: Learning the Distributions of Adversarial Examples for an Improved Black-Box Attack on Deep Neural Networks.\" ICML 2019.\nChen, Jinghui, Jinfeng Yi, and Quanquan Gu. \"A Frank-Wolfe Framework for Efficient and Effective Adversarial Attacks.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1811.10828 (2018).\n\n-  In Table 1, why for Parsimonious and Bandit methods, # of tiles parts are missing? I think both of the baselines use tilting trick? And they should also run using the optimal tiling size? The result seems directly copied from the Parsimonious paper? It makes more sense to rerun it in your setting and environment cause the sampled data points may not be the same. Since CMA costs significantly more time, it makes a fair comparison to also report the attack time needed for each method.\n\n- In Table 3, why did not compare with Bandit and Parsimonious attacks? \n"}
