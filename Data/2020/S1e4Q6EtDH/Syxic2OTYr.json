And this paper focuses on the input embedding layers. \n\nFor the experiments, the paper just compared methods using TT layer and normal embedding layer. There are many other methods that has been proposed to compress the embedding layers, it will be good to compare with one or two other methods, such as WEST or compression based on projection layers. \n\n"}
