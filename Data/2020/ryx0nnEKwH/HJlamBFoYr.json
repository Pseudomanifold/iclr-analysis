To this end, the authors introduce a non-linear function to reduce the skewness. However, the analysis and experiments are too weak to support the authors' claim.\n\n1. The motivation is not clear. Why is it necessary to reduce the skewness? There is no practical or theoretical evidence to support it.\n\n2. To verify the proposed non-linear transformation can reduce skewness, it's better to visualize the learned feature distribution to confirm this point.\n\n3. Experiments with more datasets and networks are needed to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. "}
