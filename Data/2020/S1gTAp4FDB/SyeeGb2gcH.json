This is done by training a neural network to\ngenerate production rules conditioned on being given the\nasymptotic constraints and previously generated production\nrules. This neural network is then itself also used to guide a\nMCTS to generate mathematical expressions.\n\nThe algorithms is compared against a reasonable set of baselines\nand related algorithms.\n\nFeedback:\n\nThis is a very clear and well-written paper. It was\nstraightforward to understand and very easy to see how it fits in\nwith the broader literature. The insight about using asymptotic\nconstraints makes the result a bit limited to only generating\nmathematical expressions, and it would have been a bit nicer if\nthere was something more generically applicable to program\nsynthesis in general. It's not really clear to me how the\nexisting work extends to programs.\n\nThe evaluation was very thorough and the appropriate algorithms\nwere compared against the work. I came away with a good\nunderstanding of how well the model generalizes to larger\nexpressions compared to existing work.\n\nMinor notes:\n\nThe abstract is a bit inaccurate as the NN generates production rules\nand not expressions."}
