The method is simple and easy to implement. \n\nHowever, there are still some questions the authors don't answer. \nFirstly, the authors point out that this issue also exists in some tasks like object detection, but I have no idea how to apply this method in object detection to fix this issue. \n\nSecondly, the authors make a comparison between FSPool and sum pool, average pool, and max pool, however, what about the weighted sum pool? I think it's most similar to FSPool. Maybe I misunderstand here. But please respond at my concerns and I'll change the score accordingly. "}
