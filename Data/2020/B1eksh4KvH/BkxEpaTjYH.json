Experimental results on LFW, CFP-FP, CPLFW, AgeDB, CALFW, IJB-B, IJB-C, and MegaFace verified the efficacy of the proposed method.\n\nThe writing is clear and the presentation is satisfactory.\n\nMy concerns regarding this paper are as below.\n1) What is the training computational complexity and testing time cost compared with previous works, e.g., ArcFace [Deng et al., CVPR 2019], Enforced Cross-Entropy [Zhao et al., CVPR 2018]?\n2) When perform evaluations on IJB-B/C, did the authors adopt specific strategies for set-based face recognition? What are the quantitative  comparisons between the proposed CurricularFace and NAN [Yang et al., CVPR 2017], MPNet [Zhao et al., IJCAI 2019]?\n3) Does the proposed CurricularFace only work on face? Can it generalize to other tasks? e.g., detection, segmentation.\n4) Any theoretical analysis on the choice of scale s and margin m?\n\nBased on the above comments, I decide to give the initial rate of Weak Reject for this paper, if the authors could solve my concerns in rebuttal, I would like to further adjust my rate."}
