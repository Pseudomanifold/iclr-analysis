My problem is that \"MixMatch: A Holistic Approach to Semi-Supervised Learning\" by Berthelot et al. is very similar with just a few differences on the pseudo-labelling part. Could you stress more the difference between your paper and their paper ? Because I might be wrong about it.\n\nPros:\n* Good results on C10\n* A clear related work section that divides the existing works in pseudo labelling vs consistency\n* Interesting results about the effects of using different architectures. I also like the ablation study.\n\nWeaknesses:\n* Usually, SVHN is also among the tested datasets\n* The pseudo labelling part is a bit unclear.For example, do you just refresh the pseudo-labels at the end of each epoch ?\n* minor: a typo with \"and important role\"\n\nIf there was not an existing paper already using MixUp, I would have leaned towards acceptance. You can still motivate the differences with the MixMatch paper."}
