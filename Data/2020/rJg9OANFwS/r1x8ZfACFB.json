The classical survival analysis problem assumes each datapoint is a subject (X,Y,\\delta) where X is a feature vector and Y is a life time or a censoring time depending on whether the subject is dead (when delta=1) or alive (when delta=0). The usual objective here is to predict survival times. The authors assume the features in X are interpretable readings (eg \"low blood pressure\") and indicate the number of times that reading was observed. Under this setting, such features can also be seen as words with datapoints being (BoW) documents. The goal then becomes that of finding topics that help predict life times on unseen subjects.\n\nMy main concerns with this paper are the following:\n- setting is very niche and might not be a great fit for ICLR.\n- novelty is limited since most pieces were already present in previous work.\n- experimental section only uses two datasets with little improvements.  Such small performance gap hardly convinces that the improvement by the proposed method is statistically meaningful.\n\n"}
