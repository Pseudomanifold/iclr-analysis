Unfortunately, I am unable assess the paper due to serious language problems. The text is incoherent and not understandable, it is impossible to decipher what is actually proposed.\n\nAdditional Comments:\n\nThe text reads like a machine translation gone wrong, including weird terms like \"migration learning\" (transfer learning?), \"antagonistic generation network\" / \"countermeasure generation network\" / \"confrontation network\" (GAN?).\n\nReferences are also mangled and undecipherable. And seemingly also not always well-chosen - even if I cannot map it to a paper due to bibtex problems, it appears implausible to reference a 2015 paper for something as basic as principal component analysis.\n\nIt seems that the only experiments are on simulated PET data. In may view that would be insufficient for a largely empirical application paper.\n\nThe paper claims to be quantitatively better than the baselines, but has, by far, the highest Frechet Inception distance. To my understanding, FID is a distance, lower is better.\n\n"}
