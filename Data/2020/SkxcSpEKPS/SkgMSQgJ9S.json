This paper is more like a technical report rather than a formal paper. It seems to me that this paper should be submitted to other computer vision conferences of even specific areas while not in ICLR. \n\nIssues:\n\n* Bad format or organization. The authors are suggested that they should give a subtitle of each categories of work in the related work section. The table and picture in this paper are arbitrarily designed and take too much space. In some equations, you need to put commas to separate different equations.\n\n* Acknowledgements reveal personal information in the paper. It's not allowed in ICLR submission that would review the identity of the authors. This is a highly critical issue. \n\n* Bad writing. I can barely understand what the authors are talking about. For example, \"In this paper, we propose adversarial networks of positron image memory module based on attention mechanism\". Are you referring you proposed a new GAN model in the paper? Or you proposed a positron image memory module? ...\n\n* What are the functions of the metrics used in the experimental part? The higher, the better? Or the lower, the better? Besides, you need some analysis to illustrate the significance of your results.\n\nConsidering these issues demonstrated in the paper, I recommend rejection."}
