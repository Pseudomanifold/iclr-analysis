The backpropagation method introduced is sensible, as are the experiments on known datasets to show its effectiveness. The paper is well written (apart from the miniscule Figure 3 containing the main result). \nI recommend acceptance, with caveats: the energy performance is actually not directly calculated, but speculatively estimated, it depends on the computational architecture chosen to implement the respective networks. I point out that ANNs need to be trained first to properly initialize an SNN, so the relative training effort claimed is less impressive, but energy performance does count in actual operational practice - training is (or should) be a small fraction of that."}
