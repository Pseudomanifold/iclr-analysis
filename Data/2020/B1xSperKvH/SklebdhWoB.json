The first approach of previous work is converting the weights of a trained artificial neural network (ANN) with a given architecture, to the weights and thresholds of a SNN, and the second approach uses a surrogate gradient to train an SNN with backpropagation. The true novelty of the paper seems to be in showing that combining the two approaches sequentially, trains a SNN that requiresfewer timesteps to determine an output which achieves state of the art performance. This is summarized by Table 1. However, it does not mention how many epochs it takes to train an SNN from scratch, nor compare this to the total training time (ANN training + SNN fine-tuning) of their approach. They also claim a novel spike-time based surrogate gradient function (eq. 11), but it is very practicallysimilar to the ones explored in the referenced Wu. et al 2018 (eq. 27 for instance), and these should be properly contrasted showing that this novel surrogate function is actually helpful (the performance/energy efficiency might only come from the hybrid approach). The authors argue for SOTA performance in Table 2, but the comparison to other work doesn\u2019t clearly separate their performance from the otherlisted works; For example the accuracy gain against Lee et al.,2019 only comes from the architecture being VGG16 as opposed to VGG9, as can be seen from comparing with the VGG9 architecture from Table 1, furthermore they take the sameamount of timesteps, which is supposed to be the principle gain of this work.\n\nSome small suggestions that are independent from the above:\n\n1.The most similar or relevant version of equation (2) in previous work could be referenced nearby for context.\n\n2.The last sentence of the first paragraph on p.4 \u201cthe outputs from each copy...\u201d is confusing.
