More specifically, the smoothness is on a controlled distance to the input instances, achieved by using the idea of adversarial learning (or robust learning). Generally, the paper is well-organized, with a good writing, and with sufficient experiments. However, I have major concerns about the technical contribution and the experiment parts.\n\n1. It seems that the authors employed the existing adversarial learning techniques directly to the label noise problem. The technique contribution is quite limited. I think the challenging and interesting part should be about how to learn the metric C. Currently, the authors use the semantic distances between different class labels to set-up C. This intuitively makes sense but not convincing. We expect the authors to put more effort to study C, which may depend on the label noise rates or the geometric information of the instances. An in-depth study of C will make the technical contribution solid.\n\n2. The experiment part looks sufficient but may be problematic. For example, in the subsection about Clothing1M, the authors directly cited the results from others while the experimental setting could be very different. It is not convincing to make the conclusion that the proposed method has the best performance."}
