The focus of the paper--i.e. disclose the difficulties of piano fingering data annotation and the proposal of automating this process by automatically extracting fingerings from public videos and MIDI files, using  computer-vision DNN-based algorithms \u2014although not really mainstream, it does provide some practical insights using a couple of experimental settings (piano fingering model and prediction) to help the readers. \n\nI really enjoyed reading this paper. I think that it can be considered a relevant and interesting piece of work, very well written and clear. Furthermore, providing new benchmarks/datasets/competitions for the AI community is always refreshing. Also, the results seem believable and solid, and potentially useful. \n\nMy only concern is that, although the rationale and utility of the paper is clear, the rest of the paper is somewhat incremental/engineering piece which depends somehow on previous works (see Nakamura,2019). I fail to see much novel scientific contribution to the area of research (apart from the dataset) and I\u2019m not sure whether there are enough scientific technical advancements. Furthermore, the experimental setting is somewhat limited, and it is not clear whether results are statistically significant.\n"}
