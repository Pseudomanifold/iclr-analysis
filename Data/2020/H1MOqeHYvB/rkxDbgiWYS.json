Fingering is a valuable source for piano learners and has to be manually annotated otherwise. The proposed approach is automatic and low-cost from playing videos. \n+ This paper collects a large-scale dataset for piano-fingering named APFD, including 90 finger-tagged pieces with 155K notes.\n+ The paper reads very well.\n\n\n<Weakness>\n1. One major weakness of this work is lack of technical novelty. \n- As described in section 3 in detail, the proposed approach consists of a sequence of well-known techniques (e.g. Faster R-CNN for hand detection and CycleGAN for finger pose estimation) and is largely based on lots of heuristics in every step of the procedure. \n- Thus, the method may be practically viable but bear little technical novelty.\n\n2. Experimental results are rather weak. \n- Only a single baseline is used in the existing PIG dataset, while no baseline method is compared for the new APFD dataset,  for which more baselines may need to be implemented and compared. \n- The proposed approach (64.1) is slightly worse than the previous SOTA (64.5) in the PIG dataset, although it is improved by fine-tuning with the APFD data that are not available for the previous SOTA. Thus, no experimental evidence is presented in the paper to convince that the proposed approach is better than existing ones.\n\n<Conclusion>\nAlthough this work is practically promising, my initial decision is \u2018reject\u2019 mainly due to lack of technical novelty and limited experiments.
