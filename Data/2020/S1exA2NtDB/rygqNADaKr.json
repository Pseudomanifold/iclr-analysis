As a result, the use of ES avoids the need of second-order derivative estimation resulted from PG in computing the gradients of the MAML objective; second-order derivatives in MAML are known to be tricky for proper estimation. They also explore ES-MAML with different advanced adaptation operators to improve the ES gradient estimator. They perform empirical study to demonstrate the benefits of ES-MAML as compared with PG-MAML. In particular, they evaluate the comparable algorithms (ES-MAML and variants vs PG-MAML) in terms of exploratory behaviors in sparse-reward environments, adaptation ability, the stability of deterministic policies in unstable environments, and low-K benchmarks. The experimental results are rigorous and promising. They also discuss several potential extensions to ES-MAML in the appendix. \n\nRegarding the theoretical and algorithmic contributions, this paper combines existing techniques from ES and gradient estimators to make ES gradients work for MAML. Thus, I feel that the paper does not provide significantly new results on these dimensions. For example, the substitution of policy gradient for evolution strategies in Eq. (6) is straightforward, and there is no theoretical justification for the choice of algorithmic designs made in the paper.  However, given that the paper attempts to address an important problem (stably optimizing the MAML objective) with interesting perspective (using ES), that the proposed methods are well developed and extended, and that rigorous experiments to evaluate the proposed methods are provided, this paper could be an interesting contribution to the conference where it can encourage different perspective beyond the gradient policy view for MAML problems. \n\nQuestions and comments. \n\n1. On page 3, with reference to the text \u201cThese issues: the difficulty of estimating the Hessian term (3), the typically high variance of \u2207\u03b8J(\u03b8) for policy gradient algorithms in general, and the unsuitability of stochastic policies in some domains, lead us to the proposed method ES-MAML in Section 3.\u201d I agree that the use of ES gradients avoids the need of second-order derivative estimation; however I am not very sure if we could say that ES-MAML here can address the high variance issue of PG given that ES can also suffer from high variance and that there is a rich literature in reducing variance of PG. \n\n2. Could you clarify which version of PG-MAML was used as the baseline in your experiments? Is this the \u201cvanilla\u201d version from Eq. (2) without any variance reduction techniques (e.g., Rothfuss et al. (2019), Liu et al. (2019)) or did you include one of the variance reduction techniques to the baseline PG-MAML? \n\n3. In section 4.2, with reference to the text \u201cone of the main benefits of ES is due to its ability to train compact linear policies, which can outperform hidden-layer policies\u201d, could you clarify what did this text mean? Did you mean that compact linear policies are better than hidden-layer policies for MAML, or does it mean that ES is not good at training hidden-layer policies, so it can train linear policies better than hidden-layer policies? \n\nMinor comments.  \n1.
