They used Platt scaling and isotonic regression in the situation when there is ground truth negatives. They also work when there is no ground truth negatives. In this situation, they proposed a calibration heuristics for synthetically generated negatives. Overall, the approach is not very innovative, but the problem they tackled is under studied. The presentation of the whole paper is ok, although it falls onto preliminary side. Since I did not identify any technical problem so far, I will vote for a weak acceptance, unless I observe more technical issues during the discussion.\n\n"}
