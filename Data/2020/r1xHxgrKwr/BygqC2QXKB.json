A paper is purely experimental, based on existing techniques to dimension reduction (beta-VAE and t-SNE). Given trained beta-VAE, latent vectors, obtained for training set, are feed into t-SNE algorithm. The overall anomality score for a test point is combined from 1-NN distances on t-SNE plot and reconstruction error of beta-VNE. \n\nThere is substantive question naturally appears from the application of t-SNE to obtained latent vectors. By construction, beta-VAE tries to make latent vector to be distributed according to N(0,I). By definition, it is very hard to project such a distribution on a plane, even by non-linear methods, such as t-SNE. Yet at the second step of paper's approach, this vectors are feed into 2-dimensional t-SNE. \n\nThis aspect makes me to think that optimal alpha in paper's anomality score should be close to 1. This would imply that t-SNE step is not needed at all. So, I am curious what actual optimal alpha was in experiments? \n\nOr, how would results change if t-SNE mapping would be set to Identity tranformation (into space whose dimension is the same as latent space), but formula for anomality remains the same?"}
