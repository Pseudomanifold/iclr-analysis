The authors do a good job of explaining the relative work, the methods their work builds upon. The analysis provided on various layers (Table 1) is quite insightful. \nHowever, I am not convinced by the results and found them hard to compare. The datasets used are also MNIST or Fashion MNIST and doesn't really capture the real case / challenging scenario for the anomaly detection. "}
