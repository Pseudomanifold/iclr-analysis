Thus, the authors want to design an approach where at the same time accuracy, robustness and efficiency are improved at the same time.\n\nTheir idea is \"multi-exit networks\" with inference that adapts based on the input. Particularly, their proposed \"Robust Dynamic Inference Networks\" allows each input  -- clean or adversarial -- to choose adaptively one of the multiple output layers to output its prediction. This way, they can do an investigation to new variations of adversarial attacks and adversarial defenses. Their experiments show that indeed via this approach, they can achieve the triple wins of accuracy, robustness, and efficiency.\n\n+ novel idea, promising results,  \n- Although I like the discussion of accuracy-robustness tradeoff in par 2 of Introduction, I am not sure about the statement that increasing model capacity both robustness and accuracy are improved, as used in the abstract, is always true.\n+ First time adversarial attacks and defenses are studied in a multi-output model. \n+ Interesting connection of multi-output networks with ensemble models.\n\nOverall, I believe that this is an interesting, novel paper, which could be of high interest in the ICLR community, and I would vote for its acceptance.
