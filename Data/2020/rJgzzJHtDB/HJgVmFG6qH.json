The goal is concurrently achieving accuracy, robustness and efficiency via \u2018input-adaptive inference\u2019 and \u2018multi-loss flexibility\u2019  on a multi-output architecture. The observation is that \nin a deep architecture, the representations in earlier layers can also be used for solving a specific downstream classification task. So by attaching several final classification stages at the intermediate layers and by using the uncertainty of the softmax output as a decision criteria as when to use the current output as the final decision, the authors aim to achieve a triple win.\nThe paper then proposes some attack criteria for a multi-output network.\n\nThe paper is not very well written. The paper has a designated related work section but the entire paper reads from its abstract to conclusions constantly like a literature review. This makes it hard to focus and identify the original contribution. The proposed architecture is only introduced later in detail in 3.3 after the attacks. I found the organization and writing style not very reader friendly.\n\nThe authors provide a large experimental section, however the key problem with the paper is that it blurs the evaluation issue. While the observation of using uncertainty of estimates at intermediate levels has some intuitive appeal, the decision criteria that the authors propose requires careful selection of thresholds and a good calibration. But given the thresholds the final decision is just a function of the entire network - as it should be. So a natural attack here is just attacking this decision function (or an approximate differentiable proxy) to see if this model provides extra robustness. Is such an evaluation available? Otherwise the proposed approach provides a false sense of robustness as the proposed attacks are not geared towards the actual underlying model.\n\nMinor: \nThe definition of entropy in (6) is missing a minus sign. \n\nThe notation f(\\theta| x) for theta as parameters and x as input for a function is in conflict with probability notation of conditional probabilities.\n"}
