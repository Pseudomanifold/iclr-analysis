These encodings are concatenated with standard node embeddings in transformer-like attention calculations for graph message passing. The reader finds that the proposed approach is interesting.\n\nExperimental results are also favorable.\n\nConcern: Whereas the use of random Fourier features (RFF) is well justified, a limitation is that it is based on a stationarity assumption. Thus, it may be less applicable to nonstationary structural changes. To cope with nonstationarity, a straightforward idea is to parameterize the temporal encoding by using neural networks rather than RFF. In the authors' approach, the RFF is in a sense parameterized, because the frequencies omega are learned. Nevertheless, the stationarity limitation persists.\n\nQuestion: In the ablation study, what exactly is \"the original positional encoding\"? Are they learned embedding vectors? Since the authors consider continuous time rather than discrete time, how many embedding vectors are there?\n\n"}
