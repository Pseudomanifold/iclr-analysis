The RNN was trained to report current head direction using initial head direction and angular velocity information as inputs. The authors compare the representations in the RNN to the representations found in the head direction systems of mice and flies. They find that the representations and connectivity matrices of the RNN recapitulate many aspects of the real brains\u2019 head direction systems. These include the presence of cells tuned only for head direction (\u201cring cells\u201d) and cells with combined head direction and angular velocity tuning (\u201cshift cells\u201d). These cells tile the space in a functional torus structure, as revealed by t-SNE, which resembles the structures seen in real brains. Similarly, the connectivity profiles and functional role of these cell types matches what is observed in the brains. Altogether, these results demonstrate that RNNs optimized for this task can capture both the functional and anatomical aspects of the systems found in animals. This validates the use of RNNs for studying these systems. In my opinion, it also suggests that information about the structure of brains could inform strong priors for ANNs.\n\nI think this is a great paper. It was a pleasure to read, the data was very clear, and the results very interesting. It should be accepted in my opinion. I have only a few minor notes for improvement.\n\n- Per my last note in the summary, it would be nice if the authors made the paper a little bit more relevant for machine learners by discussing how this information could potentially inform novel neural network architectures for navigation.\n\n- There\u2019s a missing reference on page 3, second last paragraph.\n\n- Figure 5 a,d, and g would be easier to interpret if they all had the same x-range as g (that way, you could see the narrower ranges and wouldn\u2019t have to notice that the scales were different).\n\n- Why have Figure S8 and Fig 3 separate? Aren\u2019t they nearly identical? Fig S8 isn\u2019t that much bigger, why not just make it Fig. 3?"}
