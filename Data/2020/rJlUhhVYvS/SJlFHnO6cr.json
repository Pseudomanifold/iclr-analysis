They find substantial amount of bias in some datasets and show that they suffer from data leakage. They further perform a more fine-grained evaluation taking into consideration the node/edge types which reduce the perceived effects. They also provide some recommendations for measuring the 'right metrics' and release clean versions of the considered datasets.\n\nStrengths:\n- The methodology is rigorous and the datasets considered is extensive\n- The paper is well written\n\nConcerns:\n- Isomorphism is not necessarily a bad thing in graph classification tasks. Especially in chemistry where a bond decides if a compound is poisonous or not. Also, as the authors themselves mention, taking node/edge labels decrease the isomorphism in most datasets.\n- The results and recommendations presented in the paper are intuitive and somewhat trivial\n- I am not sure if ICLR is the right venue for this work"}
