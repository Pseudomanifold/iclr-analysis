This is a bias which jeopardises the validity and the reproducibility of several studies, and it is theoretically analogous to data leakage effects.\nThe authors fairly discuss the problem in the introduction, with a good coverage of the related literature; the background theory is reasonably discussed, although is not very deep. The experimental part is extensive and well described, and it shows the overfitting effect very clearly. However, the novelty of the work is limited, and also the proposed solutions cannot be claimed as superior to other approaches, due to the small improvement in accuracy."}
