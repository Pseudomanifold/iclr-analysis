It first showed that stacking multiple layers with one-hop message propagation does not yield an advantage to learn node embedding from higher-order neighbors. Then it presents a solution based on learnable kth-order weight matrix, which can aggregate high-order neighbors in a more flexible and reasonable way. The approach itself is interesting. However, there are the following concerns:\n1)\tThe computational complexity. Although authors didn\u2019t provide complexity analysis, it is definitely costly to run the proposed model on large graph. That\u2019s also the reason why evaluation on Pubmed dataset was done on a sampled subset.  \n2)\tNo significant improvement over other baselines on graph embedding results, as shown inn Table 4 and 5. \n3)\tAuthors are suggested to read \u201cSimplifying graph convolutional networks\u201d in ICML 2019, which also studied the neighborhood aggregation issue and presents a simplified GCN model. \n"}
