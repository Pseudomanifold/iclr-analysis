These models are popular in econometrics, and aim at modelling the complex behavioural patterns of individuals or firms. Entities in these models are typically modelled as rational agents, that behave optimally for reaching their goal of maximizing a certain objective function such as maximizing expected cumulative discounted payoff over a fixed period.\n\nThis class of models, modelled as a MDP with choice-specific heterogeneity, is challenging as not all the payoffs received by the agents is externally observable. One solution in this case is finding a balance condition and a functional fixed point to find the optimal policy (closely related to value function iteration), and this is apparently the key idea behind \u2018nested fixed point\u2019 methods used in Econometrics.\n\nThe paper proposes an alternative. First it identifies a subclass of discrete choice models (essentially MDP with stochastic rewards) where the value function is globally concave in the policy. The consequence of this observation is that a direct method, such as the policy gradient that circumvents explicitly estimating the value function, can (at least in principle) converge to the optimal policy without calculating a fixed point. The authors illustrate computational advantages of this direct approach. Moreover, the generality of the policy gradient method enables the relaxation of extra assumptions regarding the behaviour of agents while facilitating a wider applicability/econometric analysis. \n\nThe key contribution claimed by the paper is the observation that in the class of dynamic discrete choice models with unobserved heterogeneity, the value function is globally concave in the policy. This enables using computationally efficient policy gradient algorithms with convergence guarantees for this class of problems. The authors also claim that the simplicity of policy gradient makes it also a viable model for understanding economic behaviour in econometric analysis, and more broadly for social sciences.\n\nThe paper deals with Discrete choice models with unobserved heterogeneity as a special class of MDP\u2019s and is relevant to ICLR. However, the writing style is quite technical and terse -- while I could appreciate the rigour, the authors develop the basic material until page 5 -- Notation is also somewhat non-standard at places (alternating using delta or sigma for a policy and pi for thresholds of an exponential softmax distribution) and makes it harder to see the additional structure from generic MDPs more familiar in RL. I suspect that a reader more familiar with the relevant econometric, marketing and finance literature could follow the model description more easily. \n\nThere are a number of assumptions in the paper, especially 2.4 and 2.5 that relate to the monotonicity and ordering of the states. These assumptions seem to be important in subsequent developments for showing the concavity but they seem to be coming from out of the blue. Unfortunately the authors do not provide any intuition/discussion -- an example problem with these properties would make these assumptions more concrete. I was hoping to find such an example in the empirical application however this section does not make the necessary connections with the theoretical development. There are not even references to basic claims \ndone in the abstract, for example, I am not able to find an illustration of \u2018significant computational advantages in using a simple implementation policy gradient algorithm over existing \u201cnested fixed point\u201d algorithms used in Econometrics\u2019. The lack of any conclusions makes it also hard for me to appreciate the contributions.\n\n\nMinor:\n\nAbstract:  \n.. Existing work in Econometrics assumes that optimizing agents are fully rational and requires finding a functional fixed point to find the optimal policy. \u2026\n\nAmbiguous sentence: Existing work in Econometrics [...] requires finding a functional fixed point to find the optimal policy.\n\nTheorem 3.1 and elsewhere  Fre\u00e9chet =>  Fr\u00e9chet\n"}
