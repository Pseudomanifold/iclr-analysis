The motivation is good and the position in the (vast) EEG-BCI literature is appropriate.\nHowever, I see neither a convincing case for computational efficiency (it is still a net requiring large training as opposed to simpler frequency binning / generalized svd methods), nor a convincing case for a classification accuracy breakthrough (results are similar to many other known methods). Furthermore the pictures showing 'activation' patterns are not necessarily revealing nor are they convincingly artifact - filtering. Overall the decision is to reject based on insufficient significance and impact of result - although the paper is otherwise fairly well written and organized."}
