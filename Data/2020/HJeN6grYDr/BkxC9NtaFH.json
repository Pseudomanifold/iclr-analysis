This\nharms readability of the contribution.\n\nNow regarding the contribution: given the amount of work on this topic\nand the marginal difficulty of the contribution, the only way I see\nto convince reviewers is to provide a massive empirical evaluation\nthat proves a clear win on the state-of-the-art. Unfortunately the\npaper reports results on only one dataset with no clear improvement.\n\nI would encourage the author(s) to get some help with writing and\nconduct a more thorough evaluation. See for example\nthe community effort on MOAB (Mother of all benchmarks) for BCI\n(https://github.com/NeuroTechX/moabb) that aims to provide a\nclear and public baseline.\n\nRemarks on text:\n\n- \"which is an affordable solution, noninvasive, easy setup, and portability\" -> \"which is an affordable solution, noninvasive, with easy setup, and portability\"\n\n- \"state of the art\" -> \"state-of-the-art\" when used adjective\n\n- check difference between \\citet and \\citep\n\nthen I stopped as there are too many."}
