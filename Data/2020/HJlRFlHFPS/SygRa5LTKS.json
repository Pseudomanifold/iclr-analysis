The method of creating syntactically equivalent (but semantically different) sentences is indeed interesting on its own. Experiments do support the main hypothesis -- the distilled embeddings are stronger in syntactic tasks than the default contextualized vectors. The authors provide the code for ease of reproducibility which is nice.\n\nThere is a short literature review, but I am wondering if something similar was done for static word embeddings. I understand that they are obsolete these days, but on the other hand, they are better researched, so were there any attempts to disentangle syntax and semantics in the classical static word vectors?\n\nOverall, I have no major concerns with the paper."}
