The novelty consists in separating the modeling of text and image latent representations on one hand and the modeling of a shared content representation on the other hand. Priors for text, image and shared representations are generated through an invertible \u2013 flow model. The motivation for this is to allow for complex priors. Training for the shared component is supervised using aligned text and image data, while training for the residual text and image components is unsupervised. Experiments are performed for text and image generation, using training data from the COCO dataset.\nThe proposed model presents several innovations: separate unsupervised modeling of text and image and joint supervised modeling of shared latent variables, the use of three normalizing flows for the priors respectively associated to these variables. The intuition behind the model is well introduced. However, the technical description of the model itself is somewhat imprecise. Particularly section 3.3 describing the shared component and the global model should be carefully checked. Both descriptions are too imprecise e.g. the d\u2019 dimensional component of z_v, z_t are not introduced; the derivation or explanation of eq. (10)  is not provided, J_phi in eq (9) not defined, etc. There are some typos or erros, check eq (7), (8), q_phi I instead of q_theta in \u00a73.3.\nThe experiments compare the model with several different baselines and are quite extensive. Please indicate whether you performed all the tests yourself or picked the numbers in the literature. A better description of the baselines characteristics and of the model variants (MSE, TXT) and  their relations with the proposed model, in this paragraph, would help appreciate the results.\nThe proposed model seems to compare well with different baselines, but the presentation of the experiments is not that clear. For example, the ablation study in Table 1 basically shows that the Phi_s flow component behaves similarly to the complete flow model. This MSE variant is not used anymore in the other comparisons, why? Same remark for the other baselines, why some are used and some not in the different tests? The same remark hold for the text to image experiments.\n Overall, there are interesting new ideas, a new model, insufficient model description and experiments details. \n"}
