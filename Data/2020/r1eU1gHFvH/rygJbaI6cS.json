From my understanding, a neuron is counted as a local code if there is a class A such that its activations of data points from A are linear separable from its activations of data points from all other classes. However, is this definition for data points in the training set, or in the test dataset, or union of them? I did not find the exact definition in the paper.\n\nIt designed experiments to study the number of local codes. It made 7 empirical findings by the experiments on a synthetic dataset, listed in Section 1.1. It's findings are purely empirical. The authors may clarify this work's novelty and importance.\n\nThis paper seems to be finished in rush, because there is question masks, e.g., \"Summary statistics and Kolmogorov-Smirnov hypothesis tests are reported in tables ?? in the appendix\" in Page 8, \"Results are shown in figure ?? and table 2.\" in Page 12, \"As can be in seen tables ?? and figure ?? low values of dropout are likely the same distribution\" in Page 12. The paper is very difficult to read for me, partly due to its writing in a language (local codes) that I'm not familiar with. I think that its presentation can be greatly improved for general audience. \n\nI'm not familiar with the concept of \"local codes\", and I do not understand part of the paper. "}
