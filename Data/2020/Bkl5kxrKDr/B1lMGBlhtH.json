Specifically the paper establishes connections between Nash and \u03b1-Rank in specific instances, presents a novel construction of best response that guarantees convergence to the \u03b1-Rank in several games, and demonstrates empirical results in poker and soccer games. \n\nThe paper is well-written and well-argued. Even without a deep understanding of the subject I was able to follow along across the examples and empirical results. In particular, it was good to see the authors clearly lay out where their novel approach would work and where it would not and to be able to identify why in both cases. \n\nMy only real concern stems from the empirical results compared to some of the claims made early in the paper. Given the strength of the claims comparing the authors approach and prior approaches, it seems that the empirical results are somewhat weak. The authors make sure to put these results into context, but given the clarity of the results in the toy domains I would have expected clearer takeaways from the empirical results as well. \n"}
