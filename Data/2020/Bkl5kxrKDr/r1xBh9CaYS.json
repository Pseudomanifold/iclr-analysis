Based on theoretical findings showing shortcomings of using the typical best response oracle, the paper finds a necessity for a new response oracle and proposes preference-based best response.\n\nThe theoretical contributions help further the community's understanding of alpha-rank but the method remains somewhat disconnected from other recent related literature. Therefore, I think the paper's subsequent impact could be significantly improved by making more direct comparison to recent results. Specifically:\n\n1) In the 2-player games comparisons are currently made to PRD based on its use in Lanctot et al (NeurIPS, 2017) instead of the more recent PSRO Rectified Nash approach proposed by Balduzzi et al. (ICML, 2019). Please make this direct comparison or justify its exclusion.\n\n2) The preliminary MuJoCo soccer results in Appendix G significantly increase the relevance of this work to the ICLR community given the prior publication of this environment at ICLR 2019. However, the results are currently incomplete. In particular, to again strengthen the link to existing work, comparison of the method proposed in this paper to the agents trained by population based training in Liu et al. (ICLR, 2019) would be a more informative comparison than the preliminary results presented in comparison to the na\u00efve uniform meta-solver.\n\n3) Appendix A includes a brief literature survey. This is important material to position the paper in relation to existing work, particularly for readers not familiar with the area that will rely on this to understand the paper as a self contained reference. Please move this section into the main body of the paper and expand to fully credit the work this paper builds upon.\n\n\nMinor Comments:\nIn Appendix C.4 should the reference to Figure C.7 be to Figure C.7a specifically? and the reference to Figure C. 7a be to Figure C. 7b-f inclusive? If so, I believe the available joint strategies in step 4 is missing (1,1,2) as shown in Figure C. 7f.\n"}
