The broader point of this paper is that there is inevitably some distribution shift going from train to test set - and the validation set can be a small curated set whose distribution is closer to the testing distribution than what the training dataset's distribution is. \n\nThe problem setup bears relationship to several areas including domain adaptation/covariate shift problems, curriculum learning based approaches amongst others. One assumption that I see which needs to be understood more is equation (6) - wherein, somehow, there is a Markov assumption used to zero out the contribution of the scoring network on parameters unto previous time step. Trying to understand the implications of this assumption (how the performance varies with/without this assumption) would be instructive for understanding potential shortcomings of this framework.\n\nI think the paper is well written, handles an important question. That said, I am not too aware of recent work in this area to make a decisive judgement on this paper\u2019s novelty/contributions. "}
