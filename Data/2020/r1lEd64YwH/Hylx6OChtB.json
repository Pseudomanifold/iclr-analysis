In general the motivation is quite strong, and research along these directions will no doubt be of value to the field.\n\nTo assess their hypothesis, the authors compare the representations learned in trained vs. random agents on the Unity Obstacle Tower Challenge, and demonstrate that trained agents develop semantically meaningful, sparse representations, without explicit regularization. \n\nUnfortunately, the work doesn\u2019t provide adequate baselines to properly assess the hypothesis. With the data presented, we can only make claims about *trained* vs. *untrained* agents (both of which are embodied!). In other words, an embodied agent with a random policy is not equivalent to a non-embodied agent. Thus, the data only support the conclusion that performance and task-relevant policies drive good representation learning in embodied agents, which is altogether not surprising, as one wouldn\u2019t expect representations to be good in a randomly initialized network. \n\nTo assess wither *embodiment* is a critical factor for driving good representations, the authors should compare to a model that learns from a static supervised dataset. Curiously, this idea is alluded to in the introduction, but not followed up on.\n\nOverall, there are some nicely presented ideas but the work is unfortunately incomplete, and the results cannot support the hypothesis laid out.\n\nAs a final note, the authors are encouraged to remove any assignments of gender to the agent (\u201che/him\u201d is unnecessarily used throughout).\n"}
