The idea of target-embedding autoencoders is extremely relevant for problems where the dimension of the label space is as large (or larger) than the dimension of the input features. The experiments are thorough, the theoretical guarantees are extremely well thought of and derived. The applications to modelling the progression of cystic fibrosis and Alzheimer's are extremely useful and timely.  I vote for a strong accept for this paper. \n\nI would like to see some references to the extreme multi-label classification problems (http://manikvarma.org/downloads/XC/XMLRepository.html) and some of the other probabilistic approaches attempted in this domain (please see https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5770-large-scale-bayesian-multi-label-learning-via-topic-based-label-embeddings and the references and citations).
