I will rely on the judgement of the other reviewers, whom I hope will have more experience and will better know the literature. I will report on a few issues with aspects related to the presentation below.\n\nIn fig. 1, the (a) and (b) should probaby appear below each diagram. \"on trained\" is repeated twice in the caption. \n\nIn fig. 2, the WAE acronym is defined only much later in the text. \n\nFig. 2 is also a bit confusing, since it seems like the order in which the diagrams appear should be swapped. Indeed, the text also refers to fig. 2 (b) before (a). The text just below fig. 2 also refers to Figure 1, but I think it should be 2? \n\nIn sec. 4.2, the text mentions table 2 when it should really be table 1. Also, table 1 should appear before table 2 in the body. \n\nIt looks as if the symbols () and [] are inverted? All references are referred to with () and text within parentheses (e.g. references to figures) have []. \n"}
