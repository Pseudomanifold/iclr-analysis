The also mathematically prove the GDD property and show the effectiveness of \n their algorithm (Continual-EP) on MNIST. They also show C-EP is conceptually closer to biological neurons than EP.\n\nThis paper tackles an important problem in bridging the gap between artificial neural networks and biological neurons. It is well-motivated and stands well in the literature as it improves its precedent algorithm (EP). The contributions are clear and well-supported by mathematical proofs. The experiments are accurately designed and results are convincing. I recommend accepting this paper as a plausible contribution to both fields. "}
