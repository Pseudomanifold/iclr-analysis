It takes equilibrium propagation -- where updates depend on local spatial information, in the sense that the information is available at each neuron -- and modifies the algorithm so updates are also local in time, thus obtaining C-EP. The key insight is that the updates in EP can be written as a telescoping sum over time points, eq (5).\n\nMaking equilibrium propagation more biologically plausible is an interesting technical contribution. But, taking a step back, the setup is misguided. It is true that humans can solve classification problems. And various animals can be trained to do so as well. However, it should be obvious that animals learn to solve these problems by reinforcement learning -- they are literally given rewards like sugar water for correct answers. \n\nMNIST is an unusual dataset with a stark constrast between foreground and background that is far from biologically plausible. I know it has a long and important history in machine learning, but if you are interested in biologically plausible learning then it is simply the wrong dataset to start with from both an evolutionary and developmental perspective. It\u2019s not the kind of problem evolution started with, nor is it the kind of problem human babies start with. \n\nMaybe C-EP can be repurposed into a component of some much larger, biologically plausible learning system that does a mixture of RL and unsupervised learning. Maybe not. The MNIST results provide no indication.\n\nThe authors have done a lot of solid work analysing BPTT, RBT, and C-EP. I suspect they are far more interested in understanding and designing efficient mechanisms for temporal credit assignment than they are in biological learning. That work can and should stand on its own feet.\n"}
