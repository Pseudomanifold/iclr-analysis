However, I have some concerns with the current version of this work. \n\nDecision: I vote for rejecting this paper. My main concerns are regarding both the motivation of this work and the quality and soundness of the claims. \n\n\u2014 Soundness: My major concern is with the datasets that are used for \u201cnatural\u201d distribution shift. ImageNetV2 is essentially from the same distribution as the original Imagenet. It\u2019s unclear what the distribution shift is and whether there is a distribution shift. In fact, the paper that produces Imagenet V2 tries very hard to minimize the distribution shift. Hence it seems unreasonable to use this dataset for a shift. Similarly, the other dataset used is from Imagenet Videos. Here again, it\u2019s unclear what the shift actually is, and hence using these datasets to measure performance to natural distribution shifts seems questionable. \n\n\u2014 Motivation: I am a little confused about the motivation of this work as presented. It does not seem unreasonable that robustness to one kind of shift doesn\u2019t transfer to another. It seems like the right questions to ask would be the following: Do the synthetic robustness goals seem like they would occur in natural settings? Does robustness on synthetic datasets and synthetic generations of such perturbations transfer to perturbations (of the same kind) but occurring in natural world. \n\nFinally, it seems like the novelty/contribution of this work is very small. The paper uses existing datasets and existing robustness measures. "}
