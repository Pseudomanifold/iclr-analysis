It was shown that in the context of natural distribution shifts, no current robustness intervention can really outperform standard models without a robustness intervention. The main strength of this paper is its extensive experimental study. However, I still have concerns on this work.\n\n1)  The authors mentioned \"an implicit assumption underlying this research direction is that robustness to such synthetic distribution shifts will lead to models that also perform more reliably on natural distribution shifts.\" However, I am uncertain about this point. Let us take adversarial robustness as an example, I am NOT surprising that the robustness on crafted adversarial examples cannot be generalized to the robustness over natural distribution shifts. Thus, I do not think that adversarial robustness obeys the 'implicit assumption'. In other words, the studied problem should be better connected to adversarial robustness.\n\n2) The significance of 'effective robustness' is not clear. It seems that most of insights were learnt from Figure 1, 3 and 4. Do they rely on the metric 'effective robustness'? \n\n3) In Figure 1, 'Trained with more' -> 'Trained with more data'\n"}
