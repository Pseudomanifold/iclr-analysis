In particular, it proves that when the data is \\eps linearly separable, adversarial training converges faster than standard trading. It also argues that when the data is not \\eps linearly separable, adversarial training is more robust to outlier. Simulations are constructed to verify the arguments in the paper but there is no experiments on real dataset. \n\nThe first result of this paper is interesting, that adversarial training converges faster than standard training. Studying the difference between the convergent points between adversarial training and standard training is also an interesting research problem. However, I still have two main concerns about the current version of the paper.\n1. The paper is trying to develop rigorous results, but its writing is arguably not rigorous. Many statement are not clear and some notations are used without definition. Section 4.1 has many vague statements. See more concrete comments below. \n2. I am not sure about the significance of the results in the paper. The results highly depend on the linear setting with convex losses. More than that, Theorem 1 assumes the \\eps strongly linear separable, and Theorem 2 assumes a large \\eps (if the statement is that |w* x_{k,i}| is less than a large number, it seems much less interesting). These are very strong assumptions that are usually not true in practice. Experimental results only cover carefully designed simulation as well.\n\nDetailed comments for item 1 above:\n1. Assumption 3, what is the quantifier for w? Is it for every w? There exists some w? How do you guarantee by \u201crescale the norm of w\u201d (from the footnote) to make sure that c_1 is not -\\infty?\n2. Lemma 1, this is for every x_i, or some particular x_i?\n3. What is w(t)?\n4. What is the condition on \\eta in Theorem 1? Why it is O(\\eta) in equation (11) or equation (24)?\n5. The claims in section 4.1 seem to be depended on carefully designed examples. Would it still true rigorously for general cases? \n6. In section 4.1.2 first paragraph, why ||w_t|| can not go to infinity? in the third paragraph, how assumption 2 implies p^k_i / p^k`_j = o(1), or later  p^k_i / p^k`_j = O(1)?\n7. In section 4.2 second paragraph, what is \u201ck_th category\u201d?\n8. Is w^* unique in Theorem 2?\n"}
