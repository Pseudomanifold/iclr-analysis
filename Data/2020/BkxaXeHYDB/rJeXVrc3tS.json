The structure proposed by the author(s) shows less parameters to get comparable performance with ResNet. \n\nQuestions:\n1. Does last term in (2) is a scalar? What's the dimension of $x_t$, please specify the vector dimension since it is confusing.\n2. Why compare with removing activation? We need nonlinear activation to improve the performance. What's normalization you use and why use normalization?\n3. Due to the limit motivation of your structure, maybe you need more comparation with other structures."}
