The authors first derived the theory of F-pooling to be optimal anti-aliasing down sampling and is shift-equivalent in sec 2, and then demonstrated the experimental results of 1D signals and image classification tasks. \n\nThe experimental results are actually less impressive than what are claimed in contribution and conclusion. The authors stated that \"F-pooling remarkably increases accuracy and robustness w.r.t. shifts of moderns CNNs\"; however, in Table 1-3, the winning margin of accuracy is actually quite small (<2%), and the consistency (<3.5% compared to the second best baseline except resnet-18 on CIFAR 100 has large improvement ~7-8%). \n\nQuestions:\n1. For the experiment of 1D signal on sine wave, the AA-pooling and F-pooling give the same result? \n2. Compared to AA-pooling, it seems that F-pooling has a better theoretical guarantee (i.e. the optimal anti-aliasing down sampling operation given U). But other than this, the empirical performance seem not showing particular advantage over AA-pooling. Are there any other advantages for F-pooling s.t. people might want to use it as opposed to AA-pooling?\n3. What are the limitations of the F-pooling? It is good to me that the authors discuss one limitation on the imaginary part of output and I would like to hear more on other potential limitations for this method. \n- also, if the authors can explain more on sec 2.5 it will be helpful. If we simply ignore the imaginary part, although the theory is not applicable, but what would the empirical performance be? \n\n"}
