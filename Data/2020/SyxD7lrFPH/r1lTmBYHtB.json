The method is very simple: first, transform the input 1D/2D signal into the spectrum domain based on discrete Fourier transform (DFT), then cut the high-frequencies, then transform back to the time domain using the inverse DFT. The method can be implemented using FFT and auto differentiation frameworks. The method is tested on Resnet/Desnet on CIFAR-100 and subsets of ImageNet, showing better performance than the original models.\n\nThe reviewer votes for rejection as the method has limited novelty. Spectrum pooling has been used in the community of computer vision and machine learning. Taking a random example (there are others by simple searching), in the ECCV paper \"DFT-based Transformation Invariant Pooling Layer for Visual Classification, Ryu et al., 2018\" The DFT magnitude pooling is almost the same as the authors' propositions, where the \"Fourier coefficients are cropped by cutting off high-frequency components\". \n\nThe reviewer encourages the authors to make further new developments and have a more comprehensive literature review. But in the current form, the paper has less value to be published in ICLR."}
