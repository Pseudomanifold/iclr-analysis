While the text, motivation, and experiments are fairly clear, there are some spelling/grammar mistakes throughout, and the draft could use a solid pass for overall clarity.\n\nWhile the idea of using the log trace covariance as a regularizer for the manifold is certainly interesting, it seems fairly incremental upon previous work (i.e., DMWGAN).  Even modulo the work being incremental, I still have concerns regarding the comparison to baselines/overall impact, and thus I suggest a Weak Rejection.\n\nTable 1 seems to indicate that the author's proposed method is on par with or worse than every method compared against except for 3D chair (bright).  Additionally, the lack of comparison against DMWGAN for every task (except the first) is a bit concerning, considering its similarity to the proposed method.  If the authors could check DMWGAN's performance for all of their tasks and report it, I would be more likely to raise my score."}
