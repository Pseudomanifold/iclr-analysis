The authors investigate theoretical properties of some popular f-divergences from newly developed tools. Then, the expression is used to investigate GANs with the non-saturating training scheme.\n\nThe expressions in Section 3 can be a useful tool to investigate the statistical properties of estimators with f-divergences. However, I think that the usefulness of alternative expressions in Section 3 is not very clear, though an intuitive interpretation is presented. Moreover, the numerical experiment is not sufficient to support some new expressions. Detailed theoretical analysis of the non-saturating training based on the proposed expression would be required for publication from ICLR.  In addition, the authors could shorten the paper within 8 pages that is the standard length of ICLR paper. In the paper \"On topological properties of f-divergences\" (1967), Csiszar intensively studied non-saturating properties of f-divergences\nin the paper. It would be helpful for readers to add some comments on the relation between the theoretical development in this paper and Csiszar's paper."}
