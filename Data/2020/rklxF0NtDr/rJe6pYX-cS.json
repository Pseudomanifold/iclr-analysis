In particular, the message passing procedures for individual edges are individualized (i.e. not homogeneous) while a common memory pool is also shared among these procedures. It also aims at doing message passing in the distribution level instead of singling out a particular message passing rule. The idea is new (to my understanding) and interesting. Empirical results demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed methods. On the other hand, the main concerns are:\n*Only a rough idea is introduced and discussed, then followed by some nice practical results. In the middle, there is lacking of concrete execution of the proposed idea. The devil could lie in the details. \n*many details are missing. Throughout the paper, it is not clear at all how the message functions and the inference procedure functions (or called reasoning agents) are realized in practice. Also I do not see the practical implementation would be made publicly accessible. \n"}
