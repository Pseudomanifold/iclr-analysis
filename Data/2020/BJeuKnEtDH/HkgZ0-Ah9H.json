However, the proposed method does not solve the limitations of any previous methods. Instead, it is as simple as an easy combination: the proposed SST is a sequential combination and the proposed PST has no difference with running each single method separately. To me this is more like an engineering effort rather than a research work. \n\n(1) For SST, it just connects N existing methods, using the output of method 1 as the input of method 2. The quality of results might be improved but there is little novelty. I agree combing methods can be a contribution only when there are principle designs and in-depth analysis. \n\n(2) For PST, I do not see its difference with running single method separately. Putting all previous methods altogether cannot be called being more flexible. As said in the paper, when for photorealistic transfer, the proposed PST set the loss weight of other methods except Luan et al. as 0. Then is it the same with running the single method of Luan et al.?\n\nIn general, I do not encourage such a way of exploring research. Authors should focus more on the unsolved issues in style transfer, e.g., how to do geometric style transfer (shape)."}
