This can be fruitful in settings where negotiation settings.\n\nI have some basic questions.\n\nWhy not a direct comparison with the models proposed by Wang et al., 2019, He et al., 2019?\n\nWhy is human evaluation performed only w.r.t. HED and its variant but not Sequicity?\n\n How do you come up with number 37.6 in negotiation dialogue?\n\nI think, there is a long way to go to solve the considered dialogue modeling problem. I like the application of FSTs for the problem. Why not compare w.r.t. HMMs as you mention it as a choice in the intro?\n\n\n"}
