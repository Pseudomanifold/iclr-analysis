The authors describe why this might be beneficial. The method works by finding labels that are not too far from the source image's ground-truth labels, and moving the source image in that direction. To find the target label, the authors use a threshold on the confidence of predicted ground-truth labels. The authors test their algorithm using a newly proposed metric of how much a method allows imperceptibility for a human observer. They show that their method creates images whose perturbations are more impercetible to humans, compared to other methods, but are also imperceptible to machines.\n\nMy concern is as follows: If the misclassification is between A and B, and they are related classes, is the attack so bad? And what are the scenarios in practice when a user simply wants to create an attack, without regards to the target label chosen? I imagine normally the attacker has a target label in mind, so the part of the paper that chooses a target label is not very useful; and this is the main element of novelty, since the rest of the method is from DeepFool, as the authors explain. Some specific use cases of this methods should be discussed. \n\nMinor suggestion: It would be useful to see examples like in Fig. 5 but with the classes (true/target) listed."}
