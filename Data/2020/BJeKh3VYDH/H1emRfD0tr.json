Building on the basis of pointNet and PU-net, the main contribution of the paper is identifying the problem of temporal incoherence in the process of upsampling a point cloud shape representation as well as a training loss to encourage temporal coherence. In the cases showed in the paper, the proposed method seems effective comparing to previous work which is not done on sequence data. My main concern about the work is that the experimental evaluation is limited.\n\nStrengths:\nInteresting problem and novel idea.\nThe proposed method is technically sound. From the provided results, the newly introduced training loss seems effective: the result sequences are visually more plausible and smooth.\nWeaknesses:\nQualitative results are limited and in most cases seemingly simple. In the paper as well as the companion video, there are very few examples provided. The scale of the evaluation demonstration is not convincing enough for the readers that this work could be generalized to more complicated testing scenarios.\nQuantitative results are also limited. Since the method is handling the coherence of shape deformation over time, it would be much more convincing and helpful to introduce a dense-correspondence evaluation as a benchmark. For example, one can create ground-truth correspondence from parametric morphable models and evaluate the coherence of the sequence by comparing the generated results with the ground truth.\n"}
