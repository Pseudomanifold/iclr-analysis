The present work follows the previous work on undirected acyclic graphs, where the key constraint is (3), ensuring the acyclic property. The proposed method performed favorably on artificial/real data compared to previous baselines. \n\nComments: \nI do not understand yet if the proposed formulation really ensures the acyclic condition. More precisely, the condition (3) ensures undirected acyclic property, which also implies the directed ones. However, I am afraid that the condition (3) might also eliminate DAGs containing \u201cundirected\u201d cycles, i.e., cycles when we neglect directions of edges as well. So, I think a formal proof is necessary to show that the proposed formulation can output all possible DAGs, not a subset. \n\nThe present work heavily relies on the previous work of Zheng et al. (2018). The proposed formulation is designed for DAGs, but due to my concern about the correctness raised above, it is difficult for me to evaluate the originality of the present work. \n\nMinor comments:\n-\u201cX_\\pi_j^G denote the random vector containing the variables corresponding to the parents of j in G.\u201d \u2013 this definition is not clear.
