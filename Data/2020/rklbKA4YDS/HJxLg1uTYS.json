The proposed approach is an extension of the NOTEARS algorithm which uses a neural network for each node in the graph during structure learning. This adaptation allows for non-linear relationships to be easily modeled. In addition to the proposed adaptation, the authors employ a number of heuristics from the causal discovery literature to improve the efficacy of the search. Empirical results are provided which compare the proposed algorithm to prior art. \n\nOverall, I found the paper to be well written and sensible. However, there are a few items that prevent me from recommending acceptance at this time: \n\n1) The proposed approach seems to necessitate a fair number of hyperparameters. How were these chosen? On what basis should practitioners choose their hyperparameters for real-world application?\n\n2) The authors employ causal language in both the introduction and the experiment section. However, there is no notion of (a) whether the proposed algorithm is sound and complete,  and (b) under what assumptions we can expect a fully directed graph to be reasonable (I assume the additive noise model?). \n\n3) The experiments seem to indicate that prior work (CAM) outperforms or performs similarly to the proposed method. While this shouldn't prevent a paper from being published, it would be nice to see an extended discussion as to why the authors think this is occuring. "}
