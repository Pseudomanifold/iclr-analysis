The general idea is to first figure out a few important objectives, add some helper-objectives to the original problem, and learn the weights for each individual objective by trying to keep the same order as Pareto dominance. This paper has potential, but I lean to vote for rejecting this paper now, since it is still not ready. I might change my score based on the reviews from other reviewers.\nStrengths\n- The idea is novel. Learning weights for each objective by keeping the order as Pareto dominance is an interesting idea to me.\nWeaknesses\n- The lack of experiments. The authors tested their method in only one scenario, which makes me feel unsafe. Only testing on one simple scenario does not demonstrate the effectiveness. The authors are supposed to test their method on more (complex) scenarios to show the effectiveness of their method.\nPossible Improvements\nAs mentioned before, the proposed method can be tested on more scenarios (e.g., Deep Sea Treasure, SuperMario, etc.)."}
