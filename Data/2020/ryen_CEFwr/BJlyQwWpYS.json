It builds upon previous work [Jakab 2018, Lorenz 2019] who proposed to train by reconstructing the original image from one version of the image with perturbed appearance and another with perturbed pose. It extends this approach by introducing an additional separation of foreground and background in the image. \n\nStrengths:\n+ Nicely motivates the approach of separating foreground and background\n+ Fewer landmarks are needed than in previous work\n+ Approach seems beneficial for video prediction\n+ Clear and well written\n+ Detailed description of architecture and training\n \nWeaknesses:\n- The changes and improvements feel somewhat incremental\n- Some uncertainty about the solidity of the evaluation/comparability with baselines\nResults on CelebA somewhat weak\n\nOverall the paper is well written, easy to follow, presents a straightforward extension of previous work and appears to show an improvement. I\u2019m thus generally supportive of the paper.\n\nOne question I\u2019d like to see addressed in the response is about the evaluation: as you state, the details about cropping are not known for previous work, introducing some uncertainty into the external comparisons. It would be great if you could provide some more details about the steps you took to verify that your internal baseline is indeed comparable to previous work (e.g. Lorenz 2019). For instance, on CelebA your baseline seems to fall short of Lorenz 2019, which may suggest that your substantial looking improvement on BBC Pose is indeed due to more favorable cropping.\n\nThe second concern is about the results on CelebA presented in Fig. 6 in the Appendix: It looks like the background net reconstructs almost the entire image. I would have expected that hair style, shape of ears or existence of a beard would equally warrant landmarks and appearance. It seems a bit odd that the foreground is so focused on the central part of the face. Do you have an explanation for that?\n\nMinor comments:\n- Test in Fig. 1 too small and not readable when printed\n- Fig. 1 seems to be missing an arrow pointing from image to appearance encoder\n- Why are there more than 8 points in Fig. 2 for \u201cOurs8\u201d (and more than 12 for \u201cOurs12\u201d)?\n"}
