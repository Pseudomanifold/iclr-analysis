Many techniques have been used for modelling this similarity, including predictive models, cliques and graphs. The paper uses a simple autoregressive model for generating pixel values based on the values of previously processed pixels, estimating the differences between these neighboring pixel values. \n\nThe method is implemented through copying the pixel values and adjusting the differences.  Three types of prediction, based on absolute, or relative values are examined, for image generation, colorization, super-resolution. The problems are significant, but the approach rather superficial. A small experimental study is presented, based on CIFAR-10 and downsampled ImageNet datsaets. Much more experiments, including quantitative and qualitative results are reuired, to validate the prospects of the method in different types of (complex) problems and contexts. Marginal improvements are observed in the presented results. Since image generation and image to image translation are targeted, comparison and/or combined use with Sota methods, i.e., GANs should be examined. \n\nMoreover, the paper presentation needs improvement; for example, symbols are undefined when used for the first time in the text (see eq. 3), etc.  \n\n   ", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I carefully checked the derivations and theory."}
