Content\nThe paper is very clear and easy to read, I would like to point out how well structured it is. \nThe method yields very interesting results, the whole work is very complete experimentally (saliency methods used, adversarial perturbations, models etc) and the process coherent. I would love to see it applied to different datasets: Imagenet focuses more on the foreground, whereas \"Places\" focuses more on background objects and could be interesting to use. \nThe authors referred to Sanity Checks for Saliency Maps (Adebayo et al) without using it for their results, it would be nice to add it to the experiments.\n\n\n2.
