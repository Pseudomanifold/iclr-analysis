In the new environment (where we we aim to conduct imitation learning), the expert demonstrations are unavailable, making the objective function (5) unavailable. To deal with this, the authors derive a lower bound to replace (5). \n\nIn the experiment section, the performance of the proposed method is clearly demonstrated. Environment change is a challenging case for existing imitation learning methods, while the proposed one works. \n\nWhile empirically, the performance of the proposed method is justified, I am curious how tight the bound used to replace (or approximate) (5) is. The submission offers few discussions on the error may induced by replacing (5) with the lower bound. Will such an error decrease or converge to 0, as we iterate according to the algorithm? "}
