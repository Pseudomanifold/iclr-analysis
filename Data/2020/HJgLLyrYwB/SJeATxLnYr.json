The paper proposes Indirect Imitation Learning (I2L), which aims to perform imitation learning with respect to a trajectory buffer that contains some of the previous trajectories of the agent. The trajectory buffer has limited capacity and adds trajectories based on a priority-queue that prefers trajectories that have a similar state distribution to the expert. Similarity is hereby measured by the score of a WGAN-critic trained to approximate the W1-Wasserstein distance between the previous buffer and the expert distribution. By performing imitation learning with respect to a trajectory buffer, state-action trajectories of the agent's MDP are available, which enables I2L to apply AIRL (Fu et al. 2017). By using those trajectories for the transition buffer that have state-marginals close to the expert's trajectory, I2L produces similar behavior compared to the expert. I2L is compared to state-only GAIL, state-action-GAIL and AIRL on four MuJoCo tasks with modified dynamics compared to the expert policy. The experiments show that I2L may learn significantly better policies if the dynamics of agent and the expert do not match.\n\nDecision:\nI think that the submission is below borderline in its current state. The main reason for rejecting would be the insufficient justification of some algorithmic choices, improper presentation of the experiments and the description of MaxEnt-IRL, which seems quite wrong in my opinion. However, I think that the work is interesting and sufficiently novel and could be accepted if the mentioned issues were adequately addressed.\n\nSupporting Arguments:\n- Novelty / Significance: Imitation learning from state-only observations under dynamic mismatch is an important problem and a promising approach for training robots by non-experts. The idea of performing imitation learning with respect to carefully updated trajectory buffer seems simple and effective. Although self-imitation has been applied in reinforcement learning (references in submission), I am not aware of a similar approach in imitation learning.\n\n- Soundness / Correctness:\n1. The description of MaxEnt-IRL seems quite wrong. The paper claims in Section 2.1. that MaxEnt-IRL maximizes the likelihood of the policy by optimizing the advantage function and thus only learns shaped rewards. However, the referenced paper (Ziebart et al. 2008) optimizes the weights of a linear reward function which in general does not correspond to the advantage of the learned policy. Also, the policy is not (only) proportional to the exponentiated advantage but equal to it and the normalizer of the trajectory distribution (Eq. 1) would be therefore 1.\n\n2. I think that the selection of trajectories for the buffer is not sufficiently well motivated. I2L is derived based on a lower bound but it seems that it does not even ensure improvement on that lower bound. It is not fully clear to me how the trajectory buffer is updated (see \"Clarity\") but it does not seem to ensure that the Wasserstein distance decreases compared to the last iteration. The trajectories are chosen greedily, i.e., without considering the remaining trajectories in the buffer which can be especially problematic for multimodal demonstrations. \n\n- Clarity / Presentation:\nThe paper is well-written in general and only has few typos. It is not clear to me how exactly the trajectory buffer is updated. The submission merely states that the buffer is a priority-queue structure of fixed lengths, where the trajectory priorities are given by the average state score based on the Wasserstein critic. This description leaves several open questions (see \"Questions\") and further does not seem well motivated.\n\n\n- Evaluation:\nThe presentation of the experimental results seems odd. For the imitation learning experiments (no dynamic mismatch) the (apparently) same runs of I2L are compared to GAIL-S (Table 1) and GAIfO (Table 2) in separate tables. For the experiments under dynamic mismatch, the comparison with GAIL-S are shown with learning curves (Figure 3-5) and shaded error bars, whereas the results of GAIfO are only shown in in terms of final mean performance in Table 2. This presentation may make the impression or hiding learning curves or confidence intervals. Both tables could be removed by adding a single curve to each of the plots in Figure 3-5 and 7. It is also not clear to me, why only the mean of the final performance for AIRL and SA-GAIL is shown in Figure 3-5. Instead, the performance of the expert--which is currently not shown--would be better suited as a baseline level. The paper also does not seem to mention the number of evaluations and the meaning of the error region in the figures. Furthermore, some hyper-parameters, e.g., the architectures for the AIRL reward/value-function networks are not presented.\n\nQuestions:\n- Please precisely state when the trajectories are removed from the trajectory buffer and the heap of the priority queue. May the same trajectories be used during several iterations?\n- Please elaborate: under which assumptions does the update of the trajectory buffer ensure that the W1-distance of the individual trajectories decreases with respect to the expert's trajectories? \n\n\nMinor comments:\nTypo: \"upto a constant\""}
