In the standard and linear MAB settings, the authors propose algorithms and show that they achieve optimal regret up to logarithmic factors with communication costs that are almost independent of the horizon T. In addition the authors establish interesting lower bounds on the communication cost to obtain sublunar regret.\n\nOverall I found the paper very well motivated and clearly written. I did not go through the proofs in the appendix carefully, but I did check a few sections and found them to be correct. I did have a few concerns. \n\nI found the discussion around load balancing very confusing. Perhaps the authors could provide a picture to explain the issue? In addition, there is a lack of experiments- it is always nice to see comparisons to baseline even though the theory implies you would do better. Finally, the algorithm doesn\u2019t seem extremely practical from an applied point of view - for a linear amount of time all the bandits are pulling the same arms and there is no communication at all. I understand this repeated work doesn\u2019t affect the regret - but it is an artifact of using elimination. In general optimism based approaches (such as UCB) tend to work significantly better than elimination-style methods. I\u2019d be curious to hear the authors comment on whether they think a UCB style algorithm is possible in this setting.\n\nOverall I recommend the paper for acceptance. \n\n\n"}
