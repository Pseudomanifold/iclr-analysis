The formulation is sound and the experiments are complete. My main concern is regarding the related work and experimental validation being incomplete, as they don't mention a very recent and similar work published in ICIP19 https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8803498: \"Optimizing the bit allocation for compression of weights and activations of deep neural networks\". A reference in related work as well as a comparison in experimental validation would be necessary  and the novelty of this work is rather weak given the above mentioned 2019 publication."}
