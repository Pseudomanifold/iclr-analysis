Unfortunately, the lack of clarity in the paper and poor writing prevents me from writing a thorough review. Given that the authors seem to apply off-the-shelf machine learning algorithms to NFL data, and spend a significant amount of time discussing low-level details of data storage, preprocessing, and underlying hardware/software pipelines, this paper does not appear to be a good fit for ICLR and would be better served at either a data science conference, or alternatively a sports medicine/science conference."}
