Methods such as K-NN, XGBoost, and SVM are used for the analysis and predictive modeling.\nAlthough the research is important for NFL and sports industries, there are several problems as an ICLR paper: \nFirst, it is not formatted correctly. I guess using single column, the content may be overlength. Second, the methods used in the paper are conventional and there is no novelty from the algorithmic perspective. Third, the findings is useful within the sports industry, but does not conveys much insight for the ICLR community.\n"}
