The paper discusses several system settings on data streaming and processing, along with model selection and other hyper-parameter tuning details. The problem itself is very important. However, there are several disadvantages of the current status of the paper.\n\nThe writing of this paper needs to be largely improved. The description is very redundant and the texts are very hard to read. Therefore, it makes the paper much less clear to the reader.\n\nSecond, the proposed system is not related to the focus of ICLR and it lacks the novelty. Both the data processing and model selection methods are already well-known practicies. Experiments are also not established well enough to demonstrate the advantage of the proposed solution to this problem.\n\nDue to the above issues, I think the paper is not ready for publication."}
