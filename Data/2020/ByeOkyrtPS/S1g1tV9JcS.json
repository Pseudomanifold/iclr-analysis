This probabilistic approach seems plausible, but I would honestly be surprised if something like this has not been attempted before. \n\nThe paper contains very little discussion of the relevance of the results to the state of the art and about other related techniques, making it hard for someone not from the field to judge the contribution of this work. The proposed approach seems straightforward and reasonable. I am not sure if the 50 salads database is not maybe considered a toy task, and how the results presented here compare to other work - this should definitely be addressed before publication.\n\nFinally, the paper is not well formatted, and most images have very small captions (font size), making it hard to read.\n"}
