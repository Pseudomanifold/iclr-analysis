MAHALANOBIS distance based methods were discussed, and the shortcomings of using mahalanobis distance were given (i.e. assumption that features are independent, etc). They propose to use compression based distance measures off the shelf from standard compression techniques to detect spatial feature patterns in feature space and demonstrate its effectiveness on several datasets and comparison with baselines is reported and well discussed.\n\nThe motivation of the proposed approach is clear, and the method seems novel. However, the experiments could have been done in a more complex setting. The out-of distribution samples pose a danger in safety critical applications such as autonomous driving, for example a car deployed in environment that it has not seen during the training might crash. So, it would be interesting to see the performance of both baselines and proposed approach in those settings where inputs are similar in nature but very different in some aspects. I do not necessarily see something wrong with the paper, but I'm not convinced of the significance (or sufficient efficiency) of the approach. There is also  theoretical guarantees showing exhaustiveness of the proposed methods in detecting all possible out-of distribution examples. \n"}
