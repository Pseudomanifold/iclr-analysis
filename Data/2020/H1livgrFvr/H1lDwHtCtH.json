The authors evaluate the method broadly and against the state of the art and provide a thorough explanation of the background material and formulation. \n\nThis work is strong in it\u2019s cleverness, novelty, and evaluation when limited to the class of solution stipulated in section 2; however, it is not clear or presented why this restrictive choice is or could be necessary.    For this reason, I am borderline unless that caveat is addressed as described below, in which case I would be happy to accept. \n\nIt is unclear to me as it was not presented in the work when or if the problem that is being solved by the paper is particularly either important or frequent.  Obviously, not having to retrain is more efficient than having to and not having to validate on out-of-distribution samples is helpful in times when we don\u2019t know them ahead of time, but it is unclear to me if it is the case that we will have a situation in which both of the above are, for instance, not possible at all.  To me, if the work could be changed to compare against works which are not so tightly constrained, not for the purposes of holding it to the same standard but to understand it\u2019s relative standing, or to better justify the very strict constraints which somehow, despite out-of-distribution detection being a popular upcoming topic, apparently only has one other paper that matches it.\n \t\t\nThe paper could use some extra proofreading, for instance the first sentence of the abstract doesn\u2019t make much grammatical sense especially with the first phrase included. \nIt may be nice to cite works such as http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.132.6389&rep=rep1&type=pdf and others in that vein as this is certainly not the first work to involve compressive principles in image classification related tasks.
