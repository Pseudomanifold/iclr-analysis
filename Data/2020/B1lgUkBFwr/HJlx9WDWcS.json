The paper goes on to describe some heuristic methods that resemble the gradient reversal methods due to Ganin et al for handling both problems. \n\nThe novel part of the paper over DANNs is the joint, end-to-end training of latent representations for missing data, \u00a0While it is sloppy with terminology, the paper is overall reasonably easy to follow although it might mislea a novice reader and sufficient details are provided to replicate their results.  \n\nThe major problem here is the problem appears to be underspecified, and its not clear under what conditions if any the proposed methods are valid. Moreover it\u2019s not clear to what extent the experimental results should ameliorate these concerns. \n\nIf the data is not missing at random then there is presumably confounding. The authors dance around this topic, just asserting that they are handling non-stochastic missing data but do not say precisely what is assumed about the relationship between the observed and missing data. \n\nIn short the paper addresses an under-specified problem with a heuristic technique based upon domain-adversarial nets which have recently been shown have a number of fundamental flaws. It's never made clear under what assumptions this proposed procedure is valid and the paper misrepresents the prior work on lable shift, including the theoretically sound work, e.g.:\n\n\"we assume covariate shift as in most UDA papers e.g. Ben-David et al.
