The paper\u2019s primary technical contributions are the network, and a large dataset of contact bridge games, which the authors make publicly available. \n\nI believe that the work that the authors did in regards to this paper is valuable. However, I had a very hard time following along with the paper. The major issue is the language, which I mean both in terms of particular phrases or terms going unexplained, and the grammar and phrasing of the sentences. \n\nThe most clear early example of terms and phrases going unexplained is the second section describing contract bridge. Many terms are used without any explanation. For example, what a target contract is or what a trump means in the case of contract bridge. This made the remainder of the paper, including the results difficult to understand. \n\nAs an indication of the grammar and phrasing issues in the paper I have below included issues from just the first page of the paper: \n- \u201cIn real world\u201d-> \u201cIn the real world\u201d\n- \u201chave to made decision\u201d -> \u201chave to make decisions\u201d\n- \u201cresearchers steers towards\u201d -> \u201cresearchers have focused on\u201d\n- \u201cChess, best action\u201d -> \u201cChess, the best action\u201d\n- \u201cit is independent of opponent and action history\u201d -> \u201cit is independent of the opponent or action history\u201d\n- \u201chistory actions\u201d -> \u201caction histories\u201d\n- \u201cIn early ages there are heuristic based system to assign different prior\u201d -> \u201cEarly approaches employ heuristic based systems to assign different priors\u201d\n- \u201ctry to convert the problem to a perfect\u201d -> \u201ctry to convert the problem into a perfect\u201d\n- \u201cexplicitly with neural networks, and try to optimize it\u201d -> \u201cexplicitly with neural networks, trying\u201d\n- (not a phrasing issue but I would have appreciated a citation for the claim at the end of the third paragraph of the intro)\n- \u201cSimulation based approach usually requires large\u201d -> \u201cSimulation based approaches usually require a large\u201d\n- \u201csequences of existing player and opponent\u201d -> \u201csequences of the existing player and opponent\u201d\n- \u201ca few underlying complete information state\u201d -> \u201ca few underlying complete information states\u201d \n\nThis issue of readability came up in the figures as well. The figures in the paper are dense and very difficult to parse. There is little explanation in the text, and I found them difficult to glean anything from without an understanding of contact bridge.\n\nFrom what I can gather from the paper this is good and valuable work. However, I think the paper is not yet ready for publication as a communication of this work. \n"}
