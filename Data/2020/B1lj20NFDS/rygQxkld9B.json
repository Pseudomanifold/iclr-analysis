The variational inference is implemented with MLP (amortized inference). In experiments, the results show that the proposed approach outperforms VAE-based collaborative filtering on Gowalla datasets and MovieLens datasets.\n\nMy overall judgement of this paper leans to acceptation. However, by doing a quick comparison with Liang's VAE-CF paper. The proposed algorithm seems to be an extension or modification of Liang's framework. Therefore I guess the main contribution of this paper is Eq. (9). If so, I'm expecting more detailed comparison with VAE-CF in the paper (not only quantitive evaluation).\n\nQuestions:\n\n- In Liang's paper, I see they report the evaluation results on both ML-1M and ML-20M dataset. However, in this paper, the results are reported on ML-100K and ML-1M. Why not evaluate the model on the bigger ML-20M dataset?\n\n- In Liang's paper and also He's paper (Neural Collaborative Filtering), they report NDCG@10 on ML-1M dataset. The NCF approach reaches a NDCG@10 of 0.426, Multi-DAE (denoising version of Liang's model) reaches 0.446. You are reporting NDCG@100, which is a different measure. However, the numbers in Table 4 seem to be lower than what I expected. Can you compare with them in the same condition?"}
