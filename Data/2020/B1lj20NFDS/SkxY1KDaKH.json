The model generalizes the kernel density-based intensity and applies variational inference. The model is applied to synthetic datasets, a location-based social network dataset, and a recommender system dataset. \n\nThe paper is well motivated and clearly written. I found the probabilistic modeling interesting. My major concern is that, with added complexity, the experimental results suggest that VAE-SPP is not significantly better than the existing VAE-CF on most tasks.\n\nFor the MovieLens task, it seems that the GNN is an important component in the pipeline, but no further detail is provided about it, including the network architecture. The authors might also want to provide the definitions of NDCG@k and Recall@k, at least in the appendix."}
