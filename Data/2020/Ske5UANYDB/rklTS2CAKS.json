The authors investigate the bene\ft, mainly\ntheoretical, of the proposed interpolation. They study minimax rates of\nthe proposed interpolated-NN for both classi\fcation and regression. The\nstatistical stability of the Interpolated-NN is adressed.\nThe paper is easy to understand and correctly written. Nevertheless,\nIt is a particular case of ( \\Over\ftting or perfect \ftting? Risk bounds for\nclassi\fcation and regression rules that interpolate\", Belkin, M., Hsu, D.,\nand Mitra, P. (2018a)) with an explicit interpolation schemes given by the\neuclidien distance power gamma. It appears as an application of the above\npaper which brings only few theoretical advantages and not enough to justify,\nalthough intuitive, the choice of these weights. Only few discussions and\nno comparison to others bounds (as those in the above paper) of the main\ntheorem are given. The paper is too much incremental from the papers of\nBelkin et al. (2018) and Xing et al. (2018) and the bene\fts of the proposed\ninterpolation are limited. Furthermore, the empirical performance of the\ninterpolate-NN is clearly not convincing and show no signi\fcant practical\nadvantages of the proposed method. As the goal of the paper is clearly\ntheoretical, the 'real data analysis' part is not necessary in my opinion."}
