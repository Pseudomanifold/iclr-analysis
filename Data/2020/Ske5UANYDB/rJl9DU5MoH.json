They give theoretical justifications albeit with strong assumptions.\n\nI think the paper is a good paper. However, I have concerns with the presentation quality of the paper. It is very tough to get through the paper till the end. \n\nIn my view, it would have been an Accept if the paper was well written.", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I assessed the sensibility of the derivations and theory."}
