The synthetic scene is parameterized by a vector of parameters (beta), and the Authors propose a method to optimize the evaluation loss with respect to beta by gradient descent. The key contribution is a method for calculating the gradient of the evaluation loss with respect to beta, which is done half-analytically (by differentiating the evaluation loss with respect to the training images using unrolled SGD) and half-numerically (differentiating the training images with respect to beta by sampling in the beta space).\n\nThe idea is conceptually simple and neat, but practically it seems fairly complicated to chain all these derivatives together to obtain an accurate-enough estimate of the gradient for gradient-descent.\nIt is very impressive IMO that in the end of the day this loop can indeed be closed, and synthetic scenes can be automatically optimized for transferability to real data, as the results prove.\n\nGiven the great importance of sim-to-real in computer vision and robotics, the neatness of the method, the strong results, and the clear presentation, I am rating this paper \"accept\". At the same time, I admit that I have little experience myself with sim-to-real problems and generating simulated environments, and it is thus harder for me to assess the novelty and the comparison of this approach to others.\n\n"}
