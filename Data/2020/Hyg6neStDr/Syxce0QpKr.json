However, I am inclined for weak reject as it seems to be a simple extension of previous work (Mu and Viswanath 2018) with Hard Debias (Bolukbasi et al 2016). \n\nSupporting argument:\n1. The experiments seem solid compared with previous vanilla embedding and Hard Debias work. However, due to the commonly used contextual embeddings and subword units. It wonder whether the improvement in this direction is significant. The proposed technique cannot generalized to those cases.\n2. Through among the fairness benchmark, the proposed approach seems promising. I wonder how does it change some downstream tasks that uses word embeddings.\n3. As mentioned earlier, the proposed approach is a simple extension of Mu and Viswanath 2018 and Hard Debias. \n\n\nAdditional feedback:\n1. Footnote 1 should be after the period.\n2. In Section 4.1, \u2018a better Debias result\u2019 -> `a better debias result\u2019.\n"}
