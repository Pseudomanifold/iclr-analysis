The premise is that the predictor is trained on other similar graphs. The predictor (a variational graph autoencoder) performs transfer learning through gradient-based metalearning with a combination of global and local parameters. \n\nThe paper is conceptually solid, however, it is hard to claim novelty in individual ideas in the paper. The major concern I have is with the benchmarks. It seems like the (meta) training data is very similar to the validation data. So, even though it is supposed to be a few shot prediction problem, it seems like the meta-training phase has already provided more than a \"few\" training points. Please correct me if this observation is incorrect. My rating is neutral so far (not an option in the system) and ready to change upon comments from the authors."}
