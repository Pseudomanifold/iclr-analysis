To do so, each graph is treated as a link prediction \"task\". Different from the tasks in conventional meta-learning, the graphs here are generally non i.i.d. Based on the variational graph auto-coders, the method learns two important components: the global parameters used for GNNs and a graph signature function used to modulate the parameters of inference model based on the history of observed training graphs. \nThe idea of formulating link prediction as a few-shot learning problem and solving it via multi-graph meta-learning is novel. The approach basically takes advantage of meta-learning and is expected to generalize well across graphs. The numerical study is extensive in discussing the properties of meta-graph and showing more attractive empirical performance than the existing approaches. \n\n\nComments:\n\n1. The explanation of Figure 1 needs to be improved. In its current form, the figure does not illustrate the idea of this paper very clearly. It would be better to provide more explanations on the graphical model for meta-graph and the meta-graph architecture in the context. \n\n2. The description of Algorithm 1 is confusing in some places. For example, the operation in Line 6 is commented as *compute graph signature*. However, what's actually going on is to set the signature function to stop gradient computation which seems not matching the comment. \n\n3. In section 4.2, the 5-gradient update AUC is reported to show the fast adaptation of meta-graph. However, in my opinion, it could be much more informative to show the accuracies of different gradient steps, like what has done in the experimental study of MAML. I don\u2019t think the current experimental results can well explain the property of fast adaptation. \n"}
