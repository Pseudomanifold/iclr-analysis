They argue that Fourier networks have lower confidence and thus better estimates of uncertainty in areas far away from training data. They also argue for using \u201clarge\u201d initializations in the first layers and sin(x) as the activation function for the final hidden layer.\n\nThe paper does not seem to have any significant logical reasoning on why their specific architecture works, but \"describes\" what they did. It is not clear what the novelty is, besides that they found an architecture that seems to work. Additionally while Fourier networks have lower confidence, that does not necessarily mean they are more accurate estimates of uncertainty. However the reviewer does acknowledge that the estimates are mostly likely better than ReLU networks that are well known for having terrible estimates of uncertainty.\n"}
