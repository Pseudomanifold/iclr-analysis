The main idea is to train an RL-based controller for choosing the OR operations necessary for improving & reinitializing the solution. Additionally, an ensemble method for diversifying the solution is proposed. The proposed method is shown to empirically outperform the existing OR method LKH3 for solving CVRP. \n\nOverall, this paper provides a solid contribution by proposing a new learning-based algorithm that beats conventional solver, which is quite hard to achieve. The writing is clear and easy to read. The reference and related works look complete to my knowledge. \n\nOne weakness of the paper is the lack of experiments. Since the paper focuses on the CVRP problems, it would have been nice to compare with the LKH3 on larger graphs, e.g., the case when N > 100. One could also verify the scalability of the algorithm by examining larger-scale benchmarks and compare with heuristics faster than LKH3, e.g., see [1]. I think this is crucial for demonstrating the applicability of the algorithm to real-world problems.\n\n[1] Uchoa et al., New benchmark instances for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem, EJOR 2017"}
