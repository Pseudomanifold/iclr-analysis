In experiment, the robustness of the networks increases by 20% when removing the tracking part, but the test accuracy on the clean images drops a lot. Afterwards, the authors propose RobustNorm, which performs better than BatchNorm for both natural and adversarial scenarios.\n\nDetailed Comments: \n+ The paper is well written. The paper structure is clear and figures are well illustrated.\n+ The paper understands and carefully investigates BatchNorm in a interesting and important direction. After the investigation, the improved version RobustNorm shows more potential.\n+ The experimental results seem good. The RobustNorm performs better than BatchNorm for both natural and adversarial scenarios.\n- More results on ImageNet would be better to verify the proposed RobustNorm method."}
