Specifically, it could use either DCT or DHWT to do the transforming job and explores the optimal block structure to use this new kind of PC layer. Extensive experimental studies are provided to verify the new PC layer and experimental results show that the new layer could reduce the parameters and FLOPs while not loosing accuracy.\n\nOverall, this paper provides a promising PC option for the CV community and the experiments seems solid. Although the novelty is limited, which is just to combines the DCT/DHWT with NN, the experiments are sufficient and I am glad to see that this simple idea works in practice. \n\nConcerns: This paper is based on the practical validation. Is there any theory to support that using DCT/DHWT could achieve better performance. In Image Processing, DCT/DHWT could be used to compress images or videos, but what is the benefit to use them in computer vision?"}
