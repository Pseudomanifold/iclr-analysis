While the problem formulation is interesting, the paper is not very easy to follow and there are some aspects that the paper needs to get improved to get published, in my opinion. \n\nCon & Questions:\nThe notations for the mathematical expressions are not very clearly explained. I think it causes unnecessary confusions. \nDeferring the main algorithm to the Supplementary seems weird. I think the algorithm pseudo-code should be included in the main paper so that the full method can be appreciated properly. \nThe quality of the figures is very poor. Fonts are too small and hard to read. \nTable 1 is  confusing. The numbers it presenting is not clearly described. In the caption, it says they are cross-entropy risk / accuracies, but the caption also says Pareto-Fair achieves the lowest mean risk and risk disparity. Where is the information about the risk disparity? What exactly are the number for the row Discrimination? "}
