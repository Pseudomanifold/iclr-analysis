In particular, the authors extend generalized matrix factorization (GMF) and design a dual version of GMF, which is shown in Figure 1. The proposed model is called augmented GMF (AGMF).\n\nEmpirical studies on four public datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed model, i.e., AGMF. Overall, the paper is well presented and easy to follow.\n\nSome comments/suggestions:\n\n1 The novelty of the proposed model is a bit limited from the perspective of combining two GMFs together in a dual manner.\n\n2 For the empirical studies, some details about the parameter configurations are not sufficient enough for reproducibility, e.g., for BPR-MF and SVD++. Moreover, some strong baseline methods are not included such as CDAE [WSDM 2016] and Mult-VAE [WWW 2018]. Hence, the results may not be very convincing in the context of the state-of-the-art recommendation methods with users' implicit feedback.\n\n3 The dual form of GMF may cause efficiency problem especially for the right part in Figure 1, because there may be many users who have interacted with a certain item. The authors are thus suggested to include some analysis or empirical studies on time complexity or time cost.\n\n"}
