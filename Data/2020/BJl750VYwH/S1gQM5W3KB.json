In particular, the proposed AGMF model augments conventional GMF model with 1) multi-hot encodings of historical items and users, and 2) an attention-based pooling layer to dynamically integrate the information of those items and users. Experiments on four datasets show that AGMF can outperform several baselines w.r.t. HR and NDCG.   \n\nOverall, the paper is well-organized and easy to follow. However, I have several concerns as follows:\n\nD1: It seems that the proposed method is inspired by SVD++, which leverages the interacted items of users. Thus, I suppose that the contributions of this paper are to bring this idea for both users and items, and to use attention for a better integration. From this perspective, it seems that the technical contribution is a bit weak, and it lacks critical technical challenges to be addressed. Please elaborate the technical contributions of this paper more clearly.\n\nD2: The explanations about why AGMF would be better than the other MF methods are not clearly stated. In the introduction, some claims can be found, but they are not very intuitive and may confuse the readers, such as\n-\t\u201cthe connection between user embedding and item embedding is only weakly enforced by fitting the given individual rating value\u201d. What is the meaning of \u201cweakly enforced\u201d and why?\n-\t\u201cthe latent features of a user could be potentially enriched by taking into account the latent features of the user\u2019s interacted items\u201d. How do we know that the user\u2019s interacted items can provide extra information for the user? In conventional MF model, a user embedding itself might be containing the information of the user\u2019s interacted items, as those are fed into the model as training data. As such, what is the benefit of integrating the historical item embeddings, as their information might be already contained in the user embedding. \n-\t\u201cuser embedding and item embedding may be interpreted as some high-level descriptions or properties of user and item, which are supposed to have some explicit connections.\u201d If possible, please use examples to further elaborate what are the \u201chigh-level descriptions\u201d and \u201cexplicit connections\u201d.\nOverall, the authors are suggested to find a more intuitive explanation and draw more insights for the propose model, and better with some experiments to support them. That would be more meaningful than just proposing a model that can beat baselines.\n\nRemark on D2: A possible explanation is that a user\u2019s preference might be complex or having some uncertainties, which can hardly be encoded in a single embedding vector. When having additional historical item embeddings for a user, they can collaboratively reflect more complex user preference. This is similar to using a distribution to represent a latent concept instead of using a point estimate (e.g., an embedding vector). From this perspective, AGMF is better than GMF because it increases the model flexibility. Please feel free to comment or argue this.\n\nD3: The proposed method is not compared with some recent studies:\n-\tEbesu, Travis, Bin Shen, and Yi Fang. \"Collaborative memory network for recommendation systems.\" The 41st International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research & Development in Information Retrieval. ACM, 2018.\n-\tTran, Thanh, et al. \"Signed Distance-based Deep Memory Recommender.\" The World Wide Web Conference. ACM, 2019.\n-\tWang, Xiang, et al. \"Neural Graph Collaborative Filtering.\" The 42nd International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research & Development in Information Retrieval. ACM, 2019.\nThese papers also leverage attention to integrate the information from other users or items as well. Please also discuss how the proposed method is different from them and try to include them in the experiments.\n\nD4: Why do we need to filter out both users & items (with interactions<10) for Yelp, but only users for the Amazon datasets?\n\nD5: It is not suggested to use the leave-one-out evaluation method, as it is not aligned with the real recommendation scenarios. It would be better to use all the items as the candidate set, rather than 99 randomly-sampled negative items + 1 positive item.\n"}
