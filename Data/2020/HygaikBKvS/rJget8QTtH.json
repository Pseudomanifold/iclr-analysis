The authors first analyzed the cause of instability in the prior work, from the perspective of bias and variance. Two remedies were then presented: (i) mixing the experience replay with online learning; (ii) proposing a trust region scheme to select the behavior policies. The authors finally tested the proposed method on Atari games, and showed the better results, compared with the state-of-the-art methods.\n\nIn my opinion, the empirical results are impressive, and the authors also provided some insights for the motivation. Given the results on Atari games, this paper could be a great contribution on the actor critic methods. The propositions are presented to support relevant claims, while their significance seems a bit limited, and some further clarification is necessary. The authors also need to address a few confusing statements and missing details.\n\n1. In Proposition 3, the authors claimed that mixing with on-policy data can reduce the bias. I checked the proof but did not find anything relevant. Also, what is the amount of bias reduced?\n2. In Equation (1), could you provide a formal definition for \"V\"? \n3. The authors claimed at the beginning of Section 4 that the trust region method was proposed to mitigate the bias and variance problem of V-trace. However, I did not see how this is reflected in Propositions 4 and 5. Is this statement only based on empirical results?\n4. It was mentioned right below Equation (4) that \"Observe how this inner expectation ... matches the on-policy return...\". Could you provide a formal proof?\n5. What are the hyperparameters for the 9 agents used in Figure 1? Also, how did you choose \"b\" in trust region?\n6. A few notation issues / typo:\n(1) it's -> its\n(2) In Equation (5), should \"z \\in M_{\\beta, \\pi} (s_t)\" be \"\\mu_z \\in M_{\\beta, \\pi} (s_t)\"?\n(3) At the 2nd line of Page 7, should the content for the indicator function be \"\\beta (\\pi, \\mu, s_t) < b\"?\n"}
