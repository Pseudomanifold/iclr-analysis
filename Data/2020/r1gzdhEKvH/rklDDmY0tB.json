The idea is to calibrate the prior mean and variance when the neural representation of context is updated. Overall the paper is well written and explained clearly. Some experiments are provided to show that the proposed method is able to achieve a performance competitive to Bayesian linear regression with infinite memory.\n\nThe result of this paper is interesting. But I am not sure if the current experimental results are convincing enough to justify the significance of the proposed method. \n1. The results in Section 4.2 seem to be following the setting in Riquelme 2018. These datasets are all in a supervised learning setting. It is a bit disappointing that the proposed method is not tested on RL datasets. \n2. No other baseline is provided in the experiments for comparison. \n    a. There are other methods in the literature to overcome catastrophic forgetting of neural networks, e.g regularizing the update of the network. How would that be compared to the proposed method?\n    b. What about other methods, like [1]?\n3. Most of the experiment details are missing. For example, how is the reward defined in section 4.3? What is the overhead in computation in practice, especially for the SDP?\n\n\nOther comments:\n1. Why would solving a SDP require only O(g^{0.5}) in section 3.1?\n2. In the discussion in section 3, even if equation (5) and (6) can be exactly solved, how does the heavy tailed problem mentioned in section 2 been solved?\n\n\n[1] Elmachtoub, Adam N., et al. \"A practical method for solving contextual bandit problems using decision trees.\"\u00a0arXiv preprint arXiv:1706.04687\u00a0(2017)."}
