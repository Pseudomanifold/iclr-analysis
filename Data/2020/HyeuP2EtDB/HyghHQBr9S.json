The main idea is to employ the following modeling approach on top of the model-based RL framework: a local convolution network is used to compute a score for each local state action pair, and then another network is used to aggregate all the scores. While the problem being studied is important and the experimental results seem positive, there are a few concerns.\n\nFirst, the baselines presented in the experiments are relatively weak. In Related Work, the authors discuss the differences between the proposed method and the related methods, but few of the related methods are used as baselines for comparison with the proposed method. Moreover, the experiments are quite insufficient in terms of ablating different components of the proposed methods.\n\nSecond, essentially the proposed method is trying to solve the zero-shot generalization by parameter initialization; a model is pretrained on related tasks and used as initializations for target tasks. The authors claim that it is different from prior work mainly because of the neural architecture that deals with sparse rewards via score aggregation. While the proposed architecture might be more suitable for solving tasks with sparse rewards, it is not intuitive whether it has something to do with learning zero-shot generalization. And apparently, the method will also rely on the similarity between the pretrained task and the target task, and such a scope constraint is not discussed in the paper. In other words, I'm not quite sure a better architecture is fundamental progress towards zero-shot RL."}
