The asymmetric property lies in the feature level.\n\nThis paper criticize that the task loss used in previous works may be unreliable as a measure of the knowledge from the task. However, the feature uncertainty used in the proposed model can also be unreliable and I cannot see any reliable guarantee. \n\nThe organization of Section 3 is not good. The logics in different subsections are not so clear. Some notations seem undefined.\n\nEq. (4) defines p(z_d|x,\\omega). But later it defines z_d is from p(z_d|x,y_d,\\omega). The difference between these two distributions lies in y_d. I don\u2019t know which one is used. What is p_\\theta(z_d|x,\\omega)? The notations need to be properly defined.\n\nBased on Section 3.3, the proposed model seems to require different tasks have the same total time step T and this requirement is a bit strong.\n\nIt seems that there is no Figure 2c."}
