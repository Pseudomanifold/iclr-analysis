The originality of this study lies in the use of Riemannian geometry. Specifically, the standard condition of Lipschitz continuity is replaced with a more general condition involving Riemannian distances and called Riemann-Lipschitz Continuity (RLC). Based on an appropriate definition of Riemannian regularizer and a generalization of Fenchel coupling to Riemannian geometry, the authors provide $O(\\sqrt T)$ regret (resp. risk) bounds for the online (resp. stochastic) mirror descent algorithm, under the Riemann-Lipchitz condition. The performance of the algorithm is validated on Poisson inverse problems.\n\nOverall, this is a dense, yet interesting, paper. I am not an expert in Riemannian geometry but, as far as I could check, the proofs look correct. Notably, the analysis of OMD is relatively standard, once we get a bound (Prop B.1) on the Fenchel coupling, using the Riemannian dual norm. \n\nI have essentially one main comment. Clearly, the concept of \u201cRiemann-Lipschitz continuity\u201d is different from the notions of \u201crelative continuity\u201d and \u201crelative smoothness\u201d that have been recently proposed in the literature. But it is not clear that the Riemann-Lipschitz condition can tackle convex optimization tasks in which relative continuity and relative smoothness do not hold. In particular, Poisson (linear) inverse problems have already been handled under the relative smoothness condition, using Mirror Descent or Bregman proximal methods (Hanzely and Richtarik, 2018; Hanzely et. al. 2018). Thus,\n* from a conceptual viewpoint, it would be interesting to provide some applications in which the RLC condition hold, but the relative smoothness condition does not; \n* from an experimental viewpoint, in Sec. 6, it would be legitimate to compare the present \u201cRiemannian Mirror Descent\u201d algorithm with respect to the APBG method (Hanzely et. al. 2018) and the relSGD method (Hanzely and Richtarik, 2018). \n"}
