The maximizing angular deviation formulation makes sense and seemingly correct. The heuristic solver toward this objective is shown to be relatively effective in the experiments. While the theoretical novelty of the method is limited, the application in adversarial settings may be useful to advance of this research field, especially when it is relatively easy to apply by practitioners.I recommend toward acceptance of this paper even though can be convinced otherwise by better field experts.\n\n"}
