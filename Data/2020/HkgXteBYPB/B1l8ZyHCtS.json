The question is relevant and interesting.\n\nThe authors bring in two improvements to the HRN model by (Mrowca et al., 2018). They drop the hierarchy from the shape loss, which is decipeted in Figure 3, and provide a change in the recurrent training decipited in Figure 4.  Figure 4 is only showing the modified training, not the initial HRN training, although Figure 3 contains both. For the sake of consitency and good read the Figure 4 should contain the original training image.\n\nThe description of the system is very verbose, but a concrete description of the system is only in the references, which make the manuscript hard to read and it does not fit well in a conference where one cannot assume that the audience is not an expert of this particular subfield.\n\nAs a remedy, I would suggest, a simple one-hieararcy level architecture with hyperparameters to show what is really happening. One could use the system in Figure 1 as a more thorough example.\n\nThe results looks good and valuable, altough the images provided are quite small.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
