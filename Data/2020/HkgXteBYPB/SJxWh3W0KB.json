In particular, the hierarchical relation network (HRN) as proposed by Mrowca et al. (2018). However, HRN is deterministic. This is problematic for long-term predictions because of the uncertainty of physical world. This paper builds on top of HRN. It proposes a Monte Carlo sampling based graph-convolutional dropout method that can sample multiple plausible trajectories for an initial state given a neural-network based forward dynamics predictor. It also introduces a shape preservation loss and trains the dynamics model recurrently to better stabilize long-term predictions. It demonstrates the two techniques improve the efficiency and performance of model-free reinforcement learning agents on several physical manipulation tasks.\n\nStrengths\n\nLearning physics models which accounts for the multi-modal nature of the problem is very important. Graph-convolutional dropout is one method to deal with the multi-modal nature of the problem. It is a very good contribution. \n\n The tasks evaluated are not very sophisticated. \n\nWeaknesses\n\nThe paper's contribution is very incremental. \n\nThere should be a discussion on the different type of methods to account for uncertainties, e.g. bayesian neural networks and how they differ in terms of multi-modal predictions.\n\nBecause the tasks are not very complicated, it is not clear how good the whole neural physics predictor is.  \n"}
