We can\u2019t know whether adopting the hierarchical mechanism will improve the segmentation performance or not.\n \n2 For the image classification experiments, the authors only evaluated the situation of two levels of labels. What is the performance of more than two levels? \n \n3 It seems like there are no validation datasets in the experiments. It is not clear whether they are overfitting or not. \n \n4 In the real-world, the classes often have tree-like hierarchies. This manuscript did not consider this situation. There are also no experiments in dealing with the tree-like label hierarchy.\n \n5 Training by alternating optimization (apply twice loss update from both cross-entropy and complement loss) doubles training steps. Not quite a fair comparison (not sure / also not explained).\n \n6 Not supporting details on why one method is better than the other in specific cases. Lack of insight into why it is better than the state of the art."}
