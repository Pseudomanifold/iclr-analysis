One major point of confusion however is that, while early on in the paper (introduction), it is stated repeatedly that one of the strengths of the proposed model is that it is sensitive to word order on a sentence level, this particular aspect of the model is neither evaluated nor analysed. Instead the empirical analysis focuses on sentence length, punctuation and semantics. The analysis of all these three aspects is superficial: for sentence length, it consists of  computing the sentence mean and median; for punctuation,  it consists of masking punctuation; and the last part just computes vectors of nouns only (and states that this is \"semantics\"). But there is no analysis per se.\n\nOverall, the paper presents a model and shows gains over baselines. The extent to which these gains are due to tuning as opposed to the inherent design of the model is not clear. The analysis is superficial.\n"}
