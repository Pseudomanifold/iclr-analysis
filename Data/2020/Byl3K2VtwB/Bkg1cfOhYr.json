This approach programs the data through encoder to generate membership likehood matrix H, and then generates corresponding membership matrix P using node selection. The matrix P and adjacency matrix are coupled to generate community adjacency matrix to minimize the cutting. However, despite such attractive points, the novelty and strength of this study is not outstanding enough for publication in ICLR. Details comments are as follows,\n1. Similar work such as the methods of transferring matrix E to H then to P have already been published , which reduce the novelty of this study.\n2. Though there is a schematic, the learning embedding process is still not described clearly. More details of the algorithms need to be discussed to such as how to get the node embedding matrix E."}
