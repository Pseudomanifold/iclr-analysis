However, it is difficult for me to understand the paper and I feel that it is not clearly written.\n\n1. The algorithm is not written in a box as in Algorithm 1. At first I thought algorithm 1 is the main method, but only after reading it I realized that it is one step of the algorithm. I would appreciate it if the complete algorithm (including input, output, parameters) can be summerized clearly.\n\n2. I am confused about the claim \"spectral approach underperforms significantly on the bibliographic datasets as it only uses the structure information in the graph.\" I thought the input of all methods are the adjencency matrix A.\n\n3. In table 2 and table 4, why does the paper compare different methods with different measures? Is it possible to compare all methods using all measures?"}
