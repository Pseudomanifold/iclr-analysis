I'm aware of work on general semi-supervised learning and see the much better performance of this approach compared to things like label propagation, but cannot say for sure whether the idea is novel/significant.\n\nOne q for authors -- I don't understand the core component of the proposal, is the key ingredient that have different weighting between low vs high that causes the better performance on tasks ? or is that we have less dependencies across variables (as reflected in the computational costs) that gets the better performance ?"}
