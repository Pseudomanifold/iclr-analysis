Results in a VizDoom testbed show favorable performance compared to both frontier and RL baselines, and the author's approach is more sample-ef\ufb01cient and generalizable than RL-based approaches.\n\nI wouldn't consider any particular aspect of this paper to be that novel, but it is a nice combination of leveraging active self-supervised learning to generate spatial affordance information for fusion with a geometric planner.\n\nAs humans show the best performance on the tasks, it might be worth considering learning a policy from human demonstrations through an imitation learning approach."}
