The idea is to incorporate the attention scheme in SNP and carry out the so-called attentive sequential neural process (ASNP) for sequence learning.\n\nStrength:\n1. A combination of attention into SNP.\n2. Some formulations were provided.\n3. Different tasks were evaluated to investigate the merit of this method.\n\nWeakness:\n1. The comparison for time complexity and parameter size was missing.\n2. The labels in figures were inconsistent.\n3. An incremental research."}
