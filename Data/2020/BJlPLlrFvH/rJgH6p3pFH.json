In the univariate case, the authors propose a new method to learn causal directions by exploiting the complexities of cause and effect variables. In the multi-dimensional case, where the complexity can be balanced, the authors proposed a method that learns causal direction based on independence loss.\n\n1. The independence loss part looks confusing to me. Standard results in SCM yields that the error term E is a function of both the outcome Y and X. How can you learn the term E just from Y itself? In other words, I am not sure if the conditions required in Theorem 2 is feasible. The authors need to provide some examples to justify that the conditions in Theorem 2 are feasible conditions.\n\n2. In fact, the novel idea of learning causal directions based on independence test has been extensively studied in the previous literature. I regret that this has not been mentioned in the current manuscript. Examples include:\n\nhttp://www.jmlr.org/papers/v12/shimizu11a.html\n\nIn conclusion, since the idea of using independence relations for learning the causal directions is not a very new idea and a lot of discussion of the theoretical analysis is still missing. I regret that this work seems not strong enough to be accepted by ICLR."}
