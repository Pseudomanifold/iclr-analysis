For the multivariate case, this paper extends the PNL model and use GAN for enforcing the independence between cause and noise.\n\n- However, my main concerns are regarding the assumption of this work, seeing that the assumption h(X)>h(Y) in the univariate case is easy to violate. For example, let Y=f(X)+N (a special case of PNL) with some high entropy N, then h(Y) could higher than the h(X). \n\n- In the multivariate case, it can be seen as incremental for PNL but does not offer new insights."}
