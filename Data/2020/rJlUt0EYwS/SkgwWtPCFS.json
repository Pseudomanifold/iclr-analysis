In order to tackle this problem, the system proposed in this paper, called NMET, aims at labeling sentences by exploiting the explanations given by humans. First it converts the explanations into logical formulas. This logical formulas are then exploited for partitioning the dataset into two datasets: labeled dataset and unlabeled dataset. Then, NMET relaxes the logical formulas for labeling unlabeled examples by exploiting a neural architecture that uses four modules to deal with different types of predicates. \n\nThe paper is pretty clear and well-written. It can be understood even by non-experts. The proposed approach seems technically sound and pretty novel. Moreover, the experimental results show that the proposed system achieves better performances than traditional label-only supervised models.\nThe only concern that I see in the paper is that the Deterministic Function Module is not explained very well. It is not clear to me its purpose.\n\n[Minor]\nPage 3\n\u201cthe the logical form\u201d\n"}
