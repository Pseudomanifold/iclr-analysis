This is probably not surprising, given the small size and specific nature of the STS-B task and dataset. \n\nI could agree with many of the problems that the authors describe, but the proposed solution seems to be a very specific solution that works on a given dataset (for which supervised training data is available), but I do not think it will generalize well to unseen test data in different domains. I also do not understand how the BLEU score can simply be rescaled from 0-5 - how do you determine the maximum BLEU score before rescaling?\n\nThe paper should be proofread by a native speaker, many sentences are unclear, and spacing as well as punctuation are used in weird ways.\n"}
