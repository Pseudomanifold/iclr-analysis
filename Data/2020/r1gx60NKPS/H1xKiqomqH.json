These criteria include: high correlation with human judgement; being able to distinguish similar but contradicting statements; penalizing grammatical errors, and hard to game.\n\nThe paper, as its current form, is not ready for publishing. Some suggestions and comments:\n\n- Please carefully check the paper and fix typos and confusing sentences. I was collecting these errors but eventually stopped. Some examples. Sec. 2.3: punctuation missing between \"RUSE\" and \"this method\", comma missing after \"a discrete space\"; Sec. 4.1.1: \"made to ,for example\"....\n\n- The motivation of the paper is unclear. Is your criticism only about BLEU and ROUGE, or the state of the arts in NLP evaluation in general? To make JAUNE appealing, one has to argue that the state of the arts in NLP evaluation is ineffective. For this, the paper needs to review a boarder range of metrics beyond just BLUE and ROUGE. \n\n- While the authors suggest a data-driven metric, it reads to me like a model-driven metric (RoBERTAa specifically). Doesn't it systematically bias towards a certain family of metrics? \n\n- Better and more comprehensive experimental results are highly desired. "}
