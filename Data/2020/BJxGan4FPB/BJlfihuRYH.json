Though the problem itself seems real and interesting, the solution in this work makes the problem quite trivial. In fact, any other domain adaptation method can be applied to address the problem, while the authors even did not compare with existing UDA methods which can be intuitively adapted.\n\nPros:\n-\tThe problem that this work aims to address, i.e., domain adaptation under privacy constraint, seems reasonable and important.\n\nCons:\n-\tThe authors proposed a quite trivial solution to solve this problem, which in turn makes all existing UDA adaptation methods off-the-shelf. For example, the most widely accepted DA algorithms, such as MMD and DANN, can be adapted to minimize the distance between the target encoder and the source encoder by training the weights for the target encoder. In this case, the aligner introducing more parameters is not even necessary. \n-\tThe results are not promising and inspiring. S(UL), directly applying a model trained on a source dataset, has already achieved as competent results as TAN. \n-\tThe datasets used are at a toy level from UCI. More profound discoveries are expected on DA benchmarks. \n-\tThe paper needs significant proof-reading, as there are many grammatical errors and typos.\n"}
