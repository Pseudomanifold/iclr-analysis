The main conclusion is the environment should be dynamic and non-episodic, and the environment shaping is introduced to be effective. In general, the idea is well-presented and easy to follow. However, I have some concerns about the proposed method and experiments:\n\n----\n1. In general, I think the arguments in the paper are still a bit vague to be demonstrated using only experimental results. One improvement could be using some mathematical formulation to describe the argument and conducting some analysis. For instance, the paper can formulate the environment shaping and reward shaping concretely and prove that environment shaping could replace reward shaping. \n\n\n2. For the experiment comparing the reward shaping and environment shaping: the environment shaping method is designed and more complicated than the reward shaping, I think it could be more convincing if the authors investigate and develop more approaches for reward shaping. Otherwise, it is a bit hard to argue the environment shaping could outperform reward shaping a lot. \n\n3. To argue that the non-episodic environment is better than episodic ones, I think the paper should consider more tasks besides the two mentioned in the experiment section. From figure 3, the non-episodic dynamic environment is not very clearly better than episodic one from all scenarios. \n"}
