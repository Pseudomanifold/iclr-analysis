They introduce environments with characteristics that reflect natural environments: non-episodic learning, uninformative reward signals, and natural dynamics that cause the environment to change. These factors are shown to significantly affect the learning progress of RL agents and, unexpectedly, the agents can sometimes learn more efficiently in these more challenging conditions.\n\nClarity:\n\nThe paper seems to be clearly written. The code will be made publicly available.\n\nNovelty:\n\nThe main contribution from the paper seems to be two novel benchmark problems with characteristics that reflect natural environments and an exhaustive evaluation of the performance of standard algorithms on them. While the experimental results show some light about the performance of existing methods in the proposed environment, the paper does not contain any methodological contributions. Because of this, it is hard to assess the novelty of the work.\n\nQuality and significance:\n\nWhile the paper makes some interesting points, I feel that the proposed environments are too few, and too simple and unrealistic when compared to real-world problems. Because of this, one cannot know how general and significant the conclusions obtained are."}
