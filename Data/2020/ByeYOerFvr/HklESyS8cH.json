The goal is to improve the localization accuracy on 2D human pose estimation.\n\nFirst of all, incorrect writing even exists in the title: \"... find viewpoint the dominant factor for\". I guess it is missing an \"as\".\n\nSecond, although the proposed method is technically sound, it lacks contributions that are significant enough to support a top machine learning conference such as ICLR. Basically, the proposed method proposes to add a loss term, derived from the well-known density estimation method (MDN), to solve a well-studied offset regression task. It is hard to identify significant contributions in terms of novelty.\n\nThird, the much-highlighted (even in the title) discovery, i.e. viewpoint is the dominant factor in offset regression, is trivial since it is not only an intuitively correct fact but also a conclusion that has been thoughtfully investigated in numerous previous publications."}
