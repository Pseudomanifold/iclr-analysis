The idea of reinterpreting the traditional classifier is very interesting, and the experiments show some good results of the proposed method.  \n\nHere are my main concerns of the current paper:\n1. The training procedure seems to be very sensitive, and the SGLD may take a long time at each iteration to converge. This may be a big limitation of the proposed method.\n2. According to equation (8), the proposed method is having a trade-off between classification and generation, and this seems to be the key to improve the performance of the model in generation by sacrificing some classification accuracy. I think author should emphasize this instead of energy based model.\n3. The presentation is not very clear in section 5. What is the task of calibration, and what is the definition of ECE?\n4. The robustness guarantee seems too good to be true. Although the authors claim that they allow the attacker to have access to the gradient  of SGLD, the SGLD will add noise during the forward process, this will obfuscate the gradient. In this sense, I don\u2019t think the proposed method will have the strong robustness as they claimed.\n"}
