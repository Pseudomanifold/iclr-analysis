The players can communicate with their neighborhood and share their decisions. Under the problems setting and some assumption on the neighborhood graph structure, the authors prove regret bounds for convex/strongly-convex losses and full-info/bandit settings. Specifically, the paper allows the algorithm to violate domain constraints but the sum of violation has to be sublinear in the number of trials. They also show the violation bounds simultaneously. \n\n\nComments:\nThe key assumption is Assumption 4, that the players share a doubly-stochastic matrix which is used to mix neighbors\u2019 decisions. This assumption allows to mix all players\u2019 decisions in a long run and the derived regret bounds make sense. The theoretical results are non-trivial. \n\nAs a summary, I feel the results are beyond standard previous work and has certain values. Note that I have not evaluated correctness of the results, but the results are likely under Assumption 4. \n"}
