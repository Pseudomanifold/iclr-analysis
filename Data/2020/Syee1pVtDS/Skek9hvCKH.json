The authors prove optimal regret bounds for a proposed decentralized algorithm and experimentally evaluate the performance of their algorithms on distributed online regularized linear regression problems.\n\nThe paper seems well written and well researched and places itself well in context of current literature. The authors also improve the state of the art in the field. The main weakness of the paper is the limited experimental evaluation and applicability of the assumptions and the theoretical setting that underpins this work."}
