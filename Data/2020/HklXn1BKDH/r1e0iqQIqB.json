The paper combines classical methods with learning based approaches, allowing the final system to work competitively with raw sensory inputs without requiring unreasonable amounts of training samples.\n\nI think this is a well-written \"ML-systems paper\" and I'm especially happy that real-world aspects of mobile robots are taken into account. I was able to follow the overall idea of the approach as well as the description of the three components. I also think that the experiments are well done, showing convincingly ANMs competitive performance and demonstrate, through the ablation studies, the importance of its constituting parts."}
