In this way, the robustness of the classifier is expected to be improved. For the generator, the input includes the original data sample, the gradient of the classifier, and the true label of the data sample. The paper is clearly presented and easy to follow. The experimental results relatively support the main claims of the paper.\n\nThe reasons that I go towards mild rejection for this paper are as follows:\n\n1. The general idea of improving the robustness of a classifier to by feeding adversarial examples to it is not a new idea. As shown in the paper, the idea has been adopted in Goodfellow et al. (2015) and Madry et al. (2018). In addition, [1] comprehensively studied how to ensemble different adversarial attacks as \"training data\" of a classifier to improve its robustness. The paper generates adversarial examples with a generator that takes various things as inputs, which can be viewed as an extension to the method in [2]. [2] introduced a generator that only takes the data sample as inputs and the difference to the paper is that the one in this paper additionally takes gradients and label as inputs. With Goodfellow et al. (2015), Madry et al. (2018), and [1], it may not be too hard to apply the method in [2] to improve classifier robustness. Therefore, it is questionable whether the additional information used in the generator of this paper helps and how it helps. I did not see any comparison in the experiments.\n\n2. Although the experiments look to be well conducted, it is not comprehensive enough. For the defence methods in comparison, only two approaches that fall into the exact same line of the proposed method are included. In this line, I think it is necessary to compare with [1], which combines various attacks. Moreover, I would also expect a comparison with other closely related methods such as [3] and [4], to further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed one.\n\n3. It is also suggested to do ablation tests on the inputs of the generator to see how each part of the inputs helps. If gradients and true label are removed from the generator, it reduces to [2]. Therefore, those ablation tests also help the comparison with [2].\n\nMinor comments:\n\n1. It could be interesting to visualise the perturbations that are generated from the generator.\n\n2.
