The major aim is to conduct variational inference for VAE and encoding real-world samples for GAN. My understanding is that the authors tried to achieve this by decomposing the framework into a wasserstein GAN and a standard autoencoder. I believe this paper contains promising idea.\n\nThe experiment is very thorough, and the results show that LIA achieves good empirical performance.\n\nThe method is not presented in a user-friendly fashion, and the presentation can be improved.\n\nI must admit that I do not work on this field, and cannot judge this paper with more details."}
