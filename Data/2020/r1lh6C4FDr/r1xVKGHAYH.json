They also propose a method to regularize the activation function parameters.\n\nThe authors propose an activation function that helps very little in certain cases. I am not familar with this stock prediction dataset, but the differences shown are often less than 1%. I am familiar with CIFAR-10 and the architecture they use give bad baseline results and their method of regularizing a previous learned activation function (PReLU) gives marginally better results in half the cases.\n\nThere have been many learned activation functions proposed that give significantly better results than these. This paper is simply proposing another one and showing little to no improvement."}
