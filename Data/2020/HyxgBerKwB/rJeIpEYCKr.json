Identifying the 1-D sequence of a protein is straightforward. Each protein folds to a 3D structure. Determining the 3D structure of a protein (the protein folding problem) is expensive and hard.  It is well known that the function of a protein is determined by its 3D structure. Several computational methods have been proposed for protein structure prediction, but none of these models perform well in all circumstances. Different models perform well for different kinds of proteins. The current work deals with evaluating the different models to determine which model is likely to perform better on which protein. \n\nThe authors use Graph Convolutional networks with messaging to solve this problem of evaluating protein quality. Their method is evaluated using the Global Distance Test Total Score and Local Distance Difference Test (which is done at a residue level). They use several node and edge level features like DSSP, Partial Entropy and Self Intro. \n\nPros: \n\nTheir methods perform better than comparable methods using 1D and 3D CNNs. An ablation study is conducted to show the importance of various features. The paper is well written and the source code is provided for reproducibility. Overall, this is a good application paper showing the application of a known technique to solve a problem in a new domain. \n\nCons: \n\nThe novelty is minimal and the problem is of interest only to specialists in this domain.
