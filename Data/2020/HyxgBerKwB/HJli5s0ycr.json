The major idea is to model a protein 3D model using a graph. That is, each residue in a protein is modeled as a node and one edge is added to connect two residues if they are spatially close to each other.  Based upon this graph representation, the manuscript describes a graph convolutional neural network (GCN) to predict both local (i.e., per residue) and global quality. The authors showed that this GCN method works well on the CASP11 and CASP12 data. Unfortunately, there is no experimental result on CASP13 models, which significantly reduce my interest on this paper.\n\nMinor concerns:\n\nReferences are missing or misplaced at some places. For example, in the 1st sentence of the 4th graph, \"While computational protein folding has recently received attention...\", only protein design papers are cited. Some representative protein structure prediction papers shall be cited here."}
