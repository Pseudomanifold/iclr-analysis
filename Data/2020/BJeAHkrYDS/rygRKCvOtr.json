The proposed paper ameliorates the need of defining the reward function as linear in some grounded feature space by resorting to variational autoencoder arguments. The derivations are correct, the motivation adequate, the experiments diverse and convincing. The literature review us up to date and the comparisons proper. This is a valuable contribution to the field. \n"}
