The fundamental difference between these two formalisms is that Markov Games aka Stochastic Games (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_game) are fully observed while EFGs in general are not fully observed. EFGs are called Partially-Observed Markov Games in the RL literature. \"Go\" is actually a MG, in contradiction with the authors' statement in the intro.\n\nThe authors make an artificial distinction that \"turn-based\" games cannot be handled under the MG formalism. In fact, turn-based games (even when the turn order is dynamic/stochastic) is easily handled by the MG formalism, by assigning \"no-op\" moves to players who are not active at this decision point. Therefore, I don't see why any additional mechanics are needed to apply MA-GAIL to turn-based games.\n\nSimilarly, I don't understand the necessity of (t+1)-step constraints in order the achieve a SPE, which appears to be the central contribution of this work. The one-shot deviation principle still holds even if some players' actions are \"no-ops\" at certain decision points.\n\nI did not read the proofs or experiments closely since I believe there are flaws in the central idea of this work. I'd be happy to do a more thorough review if I am incorrect about these central points."}
