As a result, a stronger equilibrium SPE is becomes the target of the proposed method. To  this end, the submission takes advantage of the previous game theory results, to formulate the problem, and transform the model to a MAGAIL form. The empirical performance of the proposed method is demonstrated using experiments.\n\nI believe the submission considers an interesting and challenging problem, and has extended the existing multi-agent IRL methods to the extensive Markov game case.
