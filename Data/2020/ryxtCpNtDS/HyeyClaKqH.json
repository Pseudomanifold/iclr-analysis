The idea is good, but it seems like GANs have been suggested for Imbalanced data sequences before. A quick search on google, I found this paper:\n\"Multi-Task Generative Adversarial Network for Handling Imbalanced Clinical Data\" by Mina Rezaei et al., arXiv:1811.10419v1\n\nMoreover, the paper doesn't seem to be comparing their results with other state of the art imbalanced sequence classification methods. The comparisons are all between different proposed GAN methods. \n\nFor these two reasons, I do not recommend this paper for publication at this point. "}
