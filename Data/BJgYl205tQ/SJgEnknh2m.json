{"title": "Authors coupled a local intrinsic dimensionality measure to assess GAN frameworks concerning their ability to generate realistic data. The proposal is straightforward and would be applied in different GAN-based approaches, mainly, being sensitive to mode collapse.", "review": "The paper is clear regarding motivation, related work, and mathematical foundations. The introduced cross-local intrinsic dimensionality- (CLID) seems to be naive but practical for GAN assessment. In general, the experimental results seem to be convincing and illustrative. \n\nPros: \n- Clear mathematical foundations and fair experimental results.\n- CLID can be applied to favor GAN-based training, which is an up-to-date research topic.\n- Robustness against mode collapse (typical discrimination issue).\n\nCons:\n-The CLID highly depends on the predefined neighborhood size, which is not studied properly during the paper. Authors suggest some experimentally fixed values, but a proper analysis (at least empirically), would be useful for the readers.\n- The robustness against input noise is studied only for small values, which is not completely realistic.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
