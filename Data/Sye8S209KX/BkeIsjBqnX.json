{"title": "Unclear Contribution and Novelty, Lack Ablation Study", "review": "The paper studies several variants of BiLSTM-max for feature transfer learned from text classification tasks, shared or not shared. It also includes experiments with an adversary that attempts to improve the transferrability of the features.\n\nThe main issue of the paper is that the contribution and novelty cannot be clearly identified. All of the proposed models have appeared before, and these respective papers offer enough experiments to showcase their effectiveness. Furthermore, there is not a clear winner for any of the models studied in this paper. This makes it impossible to assess the novelty of the particular combination of methods.\n\nSecondly, since the methods are different combinations of previously proposed approaches, better ablation study should be included that compare each component individually. The study offered in the paper only assesses the weights between transfer tasks, but not on the individual component.\n\nBased on these comments, I recommend rejection of the paper", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}
