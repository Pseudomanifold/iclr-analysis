{"title": "Need improvements", "review": "Need improvements\n\n[Summary]\n\nThis paper addresses the problem of correcting noisy labels for binary classification. It assumes the exists of fully clean data, trains an energy-based autoencoder using contrastive learning objective, and use the estimated energy to determine if a training label is corrupted or not. \n\n[Pros]\n\n1.\tThe paper summarizes different types of label noise in a sensible way. And, it is reasonable to bootstrap the learning process with a small fully clean dataset.\n2.\tThe proposed method shows encouraging results under controlled noise.\n\n[Cons]\n\n1.\tIt is not well-motivated why a contrastive objective or an energy-based autoencoder can be a good solution for label correction. In particular, the connections are not established between the discriminative feature learned by an energy-based model and the label correctness. The proposed method looks more like a binary classifier with a better-regularized structure, but still, it is unclear why an energy-based autoencoder is a good choice. \n2.\tThe proposed method is limited to binary classification, and there is no obvious way to extend it to multiple classes. \n3.\tThe experiments are on toy/small-scale datasets with controlled label noise (but the way to control the noise is not clear). To show the effectiveness of the proposed methods, experiments need to be done on larger-scale datasets with truly realistic unknown noise, Establishing state-of-the-art classification accuracy using a large-scale dataset with noisy labels can serve as strong support for this paper.\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
