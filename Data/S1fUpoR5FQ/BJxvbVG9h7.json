{"title": "Review", "review": "The authors introduce a class of quasi-hyperbolic algorithms that mix SGD with SGDM (or similar with Adam) and show improved empirical results. They also prove theoretical convergence of the methods and motivate the design well. The paper is well-written and contained the necessary references. Although I did feel that the authors could have better compared their method against the recent AggMom (Aggregated Momentum: Stability Through Passive Damping by Lucas et al.). Seems like there are a few similarities there. \n\nI enjoyed reading this paper and endorse it for acceptance. The theoretical results presented and easy to follow and state the assumptions clearly. I appreciated the fact that the authors aimed to keep the paper self-contained in its theory. The numerical experiments are thorough and fair. The authors test  the algorithms on an extremely wide set of problems ranging from image recognition (including CIFAR and ImageNet), natural language processing (including the state-of-the-art machine translation model), and reinforcement learning (including MuJoCo). I have not seen such a wide comparison in any paper proposing training algorithms before. Further, the numerical experiments are well-designed and also fair. The hyperparameters are chosen carefully, and both training and validation errors are presented. I also appreciate that the authors made the code available during the reviewing phase. Out of curiosity, I ran the code on some of my workflows and found that there was some improvement in performance as well. \n\n\n", "rating": "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
