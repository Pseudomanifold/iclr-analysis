{"title": "Interesting paper that can be significantly improved by a better organization.", "review": "This is an interesting paper on a topic with real-world application: anomaly detection.\n\nThe paper's organization is, at times quite confusing:\n- the introduction is unusually short, with a 1st paragraph virtually unreadable due to the abuse of citations. Two additional paragraphs, covering in an intuitive manner both the proposed approach & the main results, would dramatically improve the paper's readability\n- section 2.1 starts quite abruptly with he two Lemmas 7 and Theorem 3 (which, in fact, is Theorem 1). This section would probably read a lot better without the two Lemmas, as the authors only refer to the main result in the Theorem. The second, intuitive part of 2.1 is extremely helpful.\n- it is unclear why the authors have applied the approach in \"4.3\" only to a single dataset, rather than all the 11 datasets\n\nOther comments:\n- please change the color schemes for Figures 3 & 4, where the red/orange (Fig 3) and various blues (Fig 4) are difficult to distinguish \n- bottom of page 3: \"are rare as expected\" --> \"are as rare as expected\"", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}
