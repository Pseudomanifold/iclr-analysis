{"title": "Review", "review": "This paper describes a new op: Inner Average Ensemble (IAE). This op is constructed by $m$ convolution ops followed by an averaging op. The author claims using this IAE op is able to improve CNN classification performance. The experiments include MNIST and CIFAR-10 with a few network structures. \n\nFirst of all, this new proposed op is not efficient. Replace a traditional conv layer with one IAE layer it will introduce $m$ times more parameters, while, the performance gain from the authors\u2019 experiment is relatively small, which indicates, most learning capacity is wasted.\n\nSecondly, only MNIST and CIFAR-10 is not convincing that this structure change will be widely useful.\n\nThirdly, this work is not practical to apply on real tasks, because it introduced $m - 1$ times more computation. \n\nOverall, I am not convinced this structure change meets innovation standard. \n\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
