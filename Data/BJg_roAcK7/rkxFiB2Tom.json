{"title": "Simple idea, but good results", "review": "In the paper, the authors proposed a new algorithm for instance-wise feature selection. In the proposed algorithm, we prepare three DNNs, which are predictor network, baseline network, and selector network. The predictor network and the baseline networks are trained so that it fits the data well, where the predictor network uses only selected features sampled from the selector network. The selector network is trained to minimize the KL-divergence between the predictor network and the baseline network. In this way, one can train the selector network that select different feature sets for each of given instances.\n\nI think the idea is quite simple: the use of three DNNs and the proposed loss functions seem to be reasonable. The experimental results also look promising.\n\nI have a concern on the scheduling of training. Too fast training of the predictor network can lead to the subotpimal selection network. I have checked the implementations in github, and found that all the networks used Adam with the same learning rates. Is there any issue of training instability? And, if so, how we can confirm that good selector network has trained?\n\nMy another concern is on the implementations in github. The repository originally had INVASE.py. In the middle of the reviewing period, I found that INVASE+.py has added. I am not sure which implementations is used for this manuscript. It seems that INVASE.py contains only two networks, while INVASE+.py contains three networks. I therefore think the latter is the implementation used for this manuscript. If this is the case, what INVASE.py is for?\nI am also not sure if it is appropriate to \"communicate\" through external repositories during the reviewing period.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
