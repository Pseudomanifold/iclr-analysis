{"title": "Not double blind", "review": "Unfortunately, while this is interesting work, the authors emails are listed on the first page and the acknowledgments are very revealing. I am a big fan of Google, UCL, and the Royal Society, and this strongly biases my view of the work. \n\nMy biased review:\n\n- the paper is interesting, and should go to another venue. I do not think the authors will get benefit from presenting this work at ICLR (there is a tiny quantum focus).\n\n- how is the cost function justified? I'd be curious to see how the authors derived it. Right now above Eq 2.4 it seems like it is heuristic to balance successful/erroneous/inconclusive rates. If it is a heuristic, the paper should clearly state this. \n\n- using simple examples of quantum data and quantum states would go a long way towards helping me understand the problem setup (Eq 2.1). It took me a while to grok this.\n\n- The acronym POVM is never defined.
