{"title": "A challenging new task and dataset", "review": "The paper introduces a new task called \"Talk the Walk\", where a tourist and a guide has to communicate in natural language to reach a common goal. It also introduces strong baselines for the task. The descriptions are thorough and clear. My only worry is that the task is too hard and has too many complexities to be a stand alone task.  Future work will probably focus on sub-parts of the task.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
