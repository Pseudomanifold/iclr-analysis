{"title": "Nice idea, insufficient baselines", "review": "The authors focus solely on universal adversarial perturbations, considering both epsilon ball attacks and universal adversarial patches. They propose a modified form of adversarial training inspired by game theory, whereby the training protocol includes adversarial examples from previous updates alongside up to date attacks.\n\nOriginality: I am not familiar with all the literature in this area, but I believe this approach is novel. It seems logical and well motivated.\n\nQuality and significance: The work was of good quality. However I felt the baselines provided in the experiments were insufficient, and I would recommend the authors improve these and resubmit to a future conference.\n\nClarity: The work was mostly clear.\n\nSpecific comments:\n1) At the top of page 5, the authors propose an approximation to fictitious play. I did not follow why this approximation was necessary or how it differed from an stochastic estimate of the full objective. Could the authors clarify?\n\n2) The method proposed by the authors is specifically designed to defend against universal adversarial perturbations, yet all of the baselines provided defend against conventional adversarial perturbations. Thus, I cannot tell whether the gains reported result from the inclusion of \"stale\" attacks in adversarial training, or simply from the restriction to universal perturbations. This is the main weakness of the paper.\n\n3) Note that as a simple baseline, the authors could employ standard adversarial training, for which the pseudo universal pertubations are found across the current SGD minibatch.\n\n\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
