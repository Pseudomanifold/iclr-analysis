{"title": "Theoretical study and empirical testing of improvement of machine translation classifiers using dual and cyclical paths among languages", "review": "The paper addresses a means of boosting the accuracy of automatic translators (sentences) by training dual models (a.k.a. language A to B, B to A), multipath (e.g. A to B to C) and cyclical (e.g. A to B to C to A) while starting with well initialized models for translating simple pairs. The idea that additional errors are revealed and allow classifiers to adapt, thus boosting classifier performance, is appealing and intuitive. That a theoretical framework is presented to support this assumption is encouraging, but the assumptions behind this analysis (e.g. Assumption 1) are rather strong. Equation 2 assumes independence. Equations 3-5 can be presented more clearly. Not only are translation errors not uniform in multiclass settings, but they can be highly correlated - this being a possible pitfall of boosting approaches, seen as general classifier errors. The same strong assumptions permeate from the dual to the cyclical case. On the other hand, the (limited) empirical test presented, using a single dataset and baseline classifier method, does support the proposed improvement by boosting, albeit leading to improvements which are slight.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
