{"title": "A new adversarial training with domain adaptation demonstrating fair performance improvement", "review": "Authors propose a new adversarial training with domain adaptation method to overcome the weak generalisation problem in adversarial training for adversarial examples from different attacks. Authors consider the adversarial training as a domain adaptation task with limited number of target labeled data. They demonstrate that by combining unsupervised and supervised domain adaptation with adversarial training, the generalisation ability on adversarial examples from various attacks can be improved for efficient defence. The experimental results on several benchmark datasets suggest that\nthe proposed approach achieves significantly better generalisation results in most cases, when compared to current\ncompeting adversarial training methods. Paper is clearly written and well structured. The novelty of the proposed technique is fair and the originality alike. The results are not very conclusive therefore I think more experiments are needed and possible further adjustments.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
