{"title": "Qualitative analysis lacking key insights and not comprehensive enough?", "review": "I like the idea of trying to qualitatively illustrate the behavior of SGD when optimizing parameters of complex models, such as Deep and Conv Nets, but I think that the contribution is not very substantial. The connection between SGD and diffusion has been pointed out in previous papers, as acknowledged by the Authors. The study of the effect of batch size is interesting, but again somewhat derived from previous works. \n\nIt would helpful to illustrate the difference between \"crossing\" and \"moving over\" a barrier with a simple figure. \n\nThe experimental validation is interesting, although I think it is limited and perhaps the conclusions that can be drawn from it are not so surprising. I believe it would have been interesting to study other important factors that affect the behavior of SGD, such as learning rate and type of momentum. For example, a larger learning rate might allow for more crossing of barriers. Also, different SGD algorithms (ADAGRAD, ADAM, etc...) would behave considerably differently I expect. At the moment these important factors are overlooked. \n\nIt is not clear to me why we would want to avoid larger batch sizes. A larger batch size allows for a lower variance of stochastic gradients, and therefore faster convergence. I think this point requires elaboration, because this forms the motivation behind theoretically grounded and successful SGD works, such as SAGA and the like. I agree that a smaller batch-size is preferable at the beginning of the optimization, but again this is a well known fact (again, see SAGA) and it is for computational reasons mostly (being far away from the (local) mode, a noisy gradient is enough to move in the right direction - no need to spend computations to use an accurate gradient). There is no guarantee that the local optimum close to initialization is a bad local optimum in general, so I don't think that using a large batch size at the beginning is a bad idea for this reason - again it is just computational. \n\nAnother thing missing I think is the discussion around why it is potentially a good thing to cross the barrier, either at the beginning of the exploration or towards convergence to a local optimum. At the moment, the paper seems to report the behavior of SGD without key insights on the importance of crossing or avoiding crossing barriers.\n\nAs a concluding remark - there has been a lot of work on the connections between diffusions and MCMC algorithms (see e.g., the Metropolis Adjusted Langevin Algorithm - MALA) and a lot of the considerations made in the paper are somewhat known. That is, random walk/diffusion type MCMC (and even gradient-based MCMC like Hybrid Monte Carlo) struggle a lot in non-convex problems and they hardly move across modes of a posterior distribution (equivalent to crossing barriers of potential). So I'm not at all surprised that SGD does not cross barriers during optimization and I would challenge the statement in the introduction saying \"Intuitively, when performing random walk on a potential, one would expect barriers being crossed quite often during the process.\"", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
