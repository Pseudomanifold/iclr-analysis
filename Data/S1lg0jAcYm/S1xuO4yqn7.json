{"title": "This paper is very good but needs improvement", "review": "For binary layers, how to calculate and backpropagate gradients is a big problem, particularly for the binary neural networks. To solve the problem, this paper proposes an unbiased and low variance augment-REINFORCE-merge (ARM) estimator. With the help of an appropriate reparameterization, the antithetic sampling in an augmented space can be used to drive a variance-reduction mechanism. The experimental results show that ARM estimator converges fast, has low computational complexity, and provides advanced prediction performance.\n\nThis paper is well-organized. The motivation of the proposed model is well-driven and algorithm is articulated clearly. Meanwhile, the derivations and analysis of the proposed algorithm are correct. The experimental results show that the proposed model is better than the other existing methods.\n\nA few minor revision are list below.\n1) In figure 1, it seems difficult to decide which one is better from the trace plots of the true/estimated gradients. Also, why the author choose to compare the REINFORCE instead of REBAR and RELAX, since REBAR and RELAX improve on REINFORCE by introducing stochastically estimated control variates. Also, about trace plots of the loss functions, I am curious why REINFORCE has a big vibration during 1500~2000 iterations. \n2) About Table 2, are all compared methods in the same experimental settings?\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
