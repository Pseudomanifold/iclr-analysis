{"title": "Good work", "review": "This work proposes a brand new dataset to fill in the vacancy of current conversational AI community, specifically the introduced dataset aims at providing a platform to perform large-scaled knowledge-grounded chit-chat. Overall, the dataset is well-motivated and well-designed, its existence will potentially benefit the community and inspire more effective methods to leverage external knowledge into dialog system. Besides, the paper also utilizes many trending models like Transformers, Memory Networks, etc to ensure the state-of-the-art performance. The clear structure and paragraphs also makes the paper easy to read and follow.\n\nHere are some questions I want to raise about the paper:\n\n1. First of all, the design of the conversation flow though looks reasonable, but it is pretty uncommon for a human to ground his/her every sentence on external knowledges. Therefore, it would probably be better to introduce some random ungrounded turns into the conversation to make it more humanlike.\n\n2. Secondly, the whole framework is based on many modules and every one of them are prone to error. I\u2019m afraid that such cascaded errors will accumulate and lead to compromised performance in the end. Have you thought about using REINFORCE\nalgorithm to alleviate this issue?\n\n3. Finally, it would be better to introduce some noisy or adversarial apprentice to raise unrelated turns and see how the system react. Have you thought about how to deal with such cases?", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
