{"title": "Several Interesting New Priors Are Proposed For The Latent Variables in VAE", "review": "The authors point out several issues in current VAE approaches, including the rotational symmetric Gaussian prior commonly used. A new perspective on the tradeoff between reconstruction and orthogonalization is provided for VAE, beta-VAE, and beta-TCVAE. By introducing several non rotational-invariant priors, the latent variables' dimensions are more interpretable and disentangled. Competitive quantitative experiment results and promising qualitative results are provided. Overall, I think this paper has proposed some new ideas for the VAE models, which is quite important and should be considered for publication.\n\nHere I have some suggestions and I think the authors should be able to resolve these issues in a revision before the final submission:\n1) The authors should describe how the new priors proposed work with the \"reparameterization trick\". \n2) The authors should at least provide the necessary implementation details in the appendix, the current manuscript doesn't seem to contain enough information on the models' details.\n3) The description on the experiments and results should be more clear, currently some aspects of the figures may not be easily understood and need some imagination. \n4) There are some minor mistakes in both the text and the equations, and there are also some inconsistency in the notations.\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
