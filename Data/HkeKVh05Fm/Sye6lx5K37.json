{"title": "Nested NER dection", "review": "This paper describes multi-grained entity recognition. Experimental results show that the proposed Multi-Grained Proposal Network achieve better performance on NER tasks.\n\nMajor comments:\n\n- A major weakness of this paper is lack of citations to recent related studies. There are studies on nested NER published this June:\n\nA. Katiyar and C. Cardie, Nested Named Entity Recognition Revisited, NAACL/HLT 2018, June, 2018.\nM. Ju, et al., A neural layered model for nested named entity recognition, NAACL/HLT 2018, June 2018.\n\nYou need to compare these conventional methods to your proposed method.\n\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
