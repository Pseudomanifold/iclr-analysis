{"title": "Several Questions", "review": "The paper is very well written and the clarity is overall high. However, I was left with some questions about the significance of this work after reading this paper.\n\nThe authors approach the problem in the Bayesian inference framework. Essentially, the message is modeled as a linear neural network with a single latent layer. The authors only specify the distributions for the posterior and prior in the experimental section, where they set them both to Gaussians. This naturally raise the question how is this model different from the probabilistic PCA model? Moreover, I am confused why would it be necessary to introduce an approximation q(y|s) of the posterior p(y|s), when there is a well known closed form expression for Gaussians? Furthermore, this Gaussian model is well known to have non-unique maximum likelihood solution (due to the invariance to an arbitrary orthogonal transformation). How does that influence the addressed compression problem? Going back to equations (1)-(2), if the authors chose different distributions and the need for the ELBO was justified, wouldn\u2019t that lead to an approximate representation? That is, wouldn\u2019t that necessary imply some loss in compression? And if yes, wouldn't then the proposed approach be not a lossless but a lossy compression algorithm? And then why would this particular approach be better than other numerous lossy compression algorithms which the authors cite?", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
