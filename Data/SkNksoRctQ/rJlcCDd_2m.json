{"title": "A nice attempt to understand the stationary equilibrium of SGD but the paper not easy to follow", "review": "Understanding the stationary equilibrium helps to understand the practical performance of stochastic gradient descent. In this paper, the authors propose two fluctuation-dissipation relation to link measurable quantities and hyperparameters in the stochastic gradient descent algorithm. An advantage over the existing study is that the results here hold for any stationary state and do not need the analogy with continuous-time differential equations. Empirical results are also reported to verify these fluctuation relation.\n\nComments:\n\n(1) I do not quite understand the second identity of (16). In particular, it seems that the authors replace the first two $\\theta(t+1)$ with $\\theta(t)$, and do not use this replacement for the third $\\theta(t+1)$ (this was addressed by (1)).\n\n(2) It would be helpful to the readers if the authors can give the deduction process of (12). It is not easy for me to understand how it holds.\n\n(3) It is not clear to me how the second fluctuation-dissipation relation helps to determine the properties of loss function landscape.\n\n(4) In Section 2.3.1, can you give some explanation for the harmonic approximation. Also the notation $\\theta^*$ seems not to be defined.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
