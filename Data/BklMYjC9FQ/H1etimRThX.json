{"title": "Need more work", "review": "The authors propose a method to improve sample diversity of GANs. They introduce multiple discriminators, each aims to not only compare real and fake examples but also compare different \"micro-batch\" of examples. The diversity is controlled by a hyperparameter \\alpha, and some strategies to set \\alpha are studied empirically. \n\nI don't fully understand how the proposed objective can promote diversity. Under what situation will the discriminator fail to discriminate different fake samples? \n\nMany questions are unanswered in the paper. \n1. What is the equilibrium of the proposed objective? Does the proposed objective has an equilibrium?\n2. How to choose the number of discriminators?\n3. How does the proposed approach compare to other papers trying to prevent mode collapse?\n\nThe experiment Table 2 and 3 doesn't look convincing to me. The inception score and FID of the proposed approach clearly lack behind state-of-the-art approaches. I don't see any evidence showing that FID of microGAN can be better than, for example, WGAN.", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
