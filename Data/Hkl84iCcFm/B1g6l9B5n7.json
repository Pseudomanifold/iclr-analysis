{"title": "Review of \"Residual Networks Classify Inputs Based On Their Neural Transient Dynamics\"", "review": "This paper aims to view the computations performed by residual networks through the lens of transient dynamical systems. A rough intuition is provided, followed by experiments in a toy concentric circle example and on MNIST. Finally, a method to determine the appropriate depth of ResNets is proposed, though experiments are only performed in the toy concentric circle experiment. \n\nThe approach of attempting to interpret feedforward networks through a dynamical systems perspective is an interesting and worthwhile one. However, this paper suffers from a number of flaws, and is clearly not ready for publication. \n\nThe clarity of this paper can be significantly improved. In general, the text is confusing, and as currently written, it is difficult to understand the central narrative of the manuscript. The review of literature in the introduction is relatively complete, though again, the presentation makes this section difficult to understand. \n\nScientifically, it is clear that further experiments on less toy datasets and settings will be required. While MNIST is useful for prototyping, experiments on datasets such as CIFAR (or ideally ImageNet) will be necessary to evaluate whether the observations made hold in more realistic settings. Moreover, the primary claim: that ResNets sum the residuals across layers is by definition true and by design. The scientific contribution of this statement is therefore questionable.\n\nIn addition, the case analyzed in the majority of the paper -- weight sharing across all layers -- is an unusual one, and as Figure 3 shows, clearly changes the network dynamics. The use of sigmoid activation functions is also an unusual one given that ResNets are generally trained with ReLU activations. \n\nFinally, the proposed method for determining the optimal depth for ResNets is an interesting idea, and worth further examination. However, the paper currently evaluates this only on an an extremely toy dataset of concentric circles. Evaluation on more realistic datasets (comparatively) with appropriate baselines will be required to determine whether this method is in fact helpful. \n", "rating": "2: Strong rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
