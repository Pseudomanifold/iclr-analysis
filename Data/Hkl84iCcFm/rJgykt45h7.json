{"title": "Interesting direction, but questionable significance of contributions ", "review": "This paper presents the following main insight (quoting the authors): Resnets classify input patterns based on the sum of the transient dynamics of the residuals in different layers.\nThe authors formulate this insight mathematically, and experimentally demonstrate its validity on a toy binary classification problem. They also show that the behaviour of a Residual network trained on MNIST is in line with the claims. Finally, a method to adapt the depth of a Residual network during training is proposed and applied to the toy classification problem.\n\nThe paper is generally of good quality and easy to understand. My only complaint: the introduction (including related work) is too long and I think it will be unclear to a general reader before reading section 2, where the terms used in the paper are explained and clarified. I think it will be an improvement to leave out detailed discussion of related work for a separate section, and focus on clarifying what the paper is about.\n\nOverall, while the paper is related to an interesting and potentially fruitful perspective of neural networks (as dynamical systems), in my view the contributions are not significant at this stage. That the sum of transients determines network outputs is almost by design, and can be shown without a dynamical systems perspective. Using the paper\u2019s notation, one can sum over the equations for all the layers to obtain this.\n\nx(1) = x(0) + y(1)\n\u2026\nx(T) = x(T-1) + y(T)\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nx(T) = x(0) + sum(y(t))\n\nSince the classification is performed using x(T), it is clear that the sum of transients is what causes the change in representation and that y(T) can be the same or not for different class inputs.\n\nBased on my understanding, I don\u2019t find the findings to be significantly novel or surprising. In particular, I don\u2019t see any concrete benefits of employing a dynamical systems perspective here. Nevertheless, the experimental analysis is interesting, and I\u2019m hopeful that this direction will lead to more insights in the future.\n\nThe final contribution is a new method to learn the depth of Residual networks during training, but this is insufficiently explored (only tested on the toy dataset) so its practical significance can not be evaluated at this stage.\n\n\nMinor notes:\n- Note that many citations are textual when they should be parenthetical.\n- The reference \u201cNo & Liao (2016)\u201d has incorrect author name.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
