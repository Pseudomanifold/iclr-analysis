{"title": "Review", "review": "The authors present a study on scheduling multi-agent communication. Specifically, the authors look into cases where agents share the same reward and they are in a partially observable environment, each of them with different observations. The main contribution of this work is that authors provide a model for communication scheduling for dealing with cases where only a certain number of agents is allowed to communicate.\n\nThe paper is very clear, positions the work very well in the literature of MARL and communication. The authors perform experiments in two environments and include a number of reasonable baselines (e.g., adapted DIAL for top(k))  as well as the full-communication upper bound. \nThe authors moreover provide a nice analysis on the messages in the predator-pray experiment.\n\nMy only concern is that authors report \"DIAL(1) performs worse than SchedNet-Top(1)\".  However, Figure 3a clearly shows that Dial(1) to be within the variance of Sched-Top(1) -- from this it's not clear that the null hypothesis can be rejected. The authors should probably verify this with a statistical test cause at the moment their claim is unsupported. Moreover, why Figure 3c does not contain the same models as Figure 3a (e.g., DIAL appears to be missing)?\n\n\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
