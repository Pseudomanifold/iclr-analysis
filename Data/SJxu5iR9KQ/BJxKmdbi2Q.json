{"title": "Well written, easy to follow.", "review": "The authors present a setting of MARL communication where only a number of agents can broadcast messages in a shared and limited bandwidth channel. The paper is well written and easy to follow, and the authors run an extensive number of baselines to illustrate the contributions.\n\nComments:\n\n1) It's not clear to me how do the authors tackle partial observability without the use of recurrent connections or time-steps?\n\n2) Do the agents know if they were chosen to be broadcasted at the previous timestep?\n\n3) Many times it's important to know who sent the message, do the agents share this information?", "rating": "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
