{"title": "Idea not convincing enough", "review": "The paper proposes a method to use videos paired with captions to improve sentence embeddings. They report improved performance on several semantic similarity benchmarks. I do not find the ideas significant. The cluster hypothesis and the perceptual hypothesis should both be naturally captured by projections between visual and textual space. The improvements over projections are also minimal. \n\nI was curious about how the model performance compares to the best model on STS (not just among multimodal baselines).   \n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
