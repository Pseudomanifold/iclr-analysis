{"title": "Review for \"Generative model based on minimizing exact empirical Wasserstein distance\".", "review": "The authors propose to estimate and minimize the empirical Wasserstein distance between batches of samples of real and fake data, then calculate a (sub) gradient of it with respect to the generator's parameters and use it to train generative models.\n\nThis is an approach that has been tried[1,2] (even with the addition of entropy regularization) and studied [1-5] extensively. It doesn't scale, and for extremely well understood reasons[2,3]. The bias of the empirical Wasserstein estimate requires an exponential number of samples as the number of dimensions increases to reach a certain amount of error [2-6]. Indeed, it requires an exponential number of samples to even differentiate between two batches of the same Gaussian[4]. On top of these arguments, the results do not suggest any new finding or that these theoretical limitations would not be relevant in practice. If the authors have results and design choices making this method work in a high dimensional problem such as LSUN, I will revise my review.\n\n[1]: https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.00292\n[2]: https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02511\n[3]: https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.07822\n[4]: https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00573\n[5]: http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~gretton/papers/SriFukGreSchetal12.pdf\n[6]: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0377042794900337", "rating": "2: Strong rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
