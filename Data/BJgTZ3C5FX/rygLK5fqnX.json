{"title": "promising results and idea", "review": "The paper proposed to use the exact empirical Wasserstein distance to supervise the training of generative model. To this end, the authors formulated the optimal transport cost as a linear programming problem. The quantitative results-- empirical Wasserstein distance show the superiority of the proposed methods.\n \nMy concerns come from both theoretical and experimental aspects:\nThe linear-programming problem Eq.(4)-Eq.(7) has been studied in existing literature.\nThe contribution is about combining this existing method to supervise a standard neural network parametrized generator, so I am not quite sure if this contribution is sufficient for the ICLR submission.\nIn such a case, further experimental or theoretical study about the convergence of Algorithm 1 seems important to me.\n \nAs to the experiments, firstly, EWD seems to be a little bit biased since EWD is literally used to supervise the training of the proposed method.\nOther quantitative metric studies can help justifying the improvement.\nAlso, given that the paper brings the WGAN family into comparison, the large scale image dataset should be included since WGAN have already demonstrated their success.\n \nLast things, missing parentheses in step 8 of Algorithm 1 and overlength of url in references.\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}
