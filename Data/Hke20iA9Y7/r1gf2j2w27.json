{"title": "Good work overall", "review": "This paper proposes a method for estimating non-linear similarities between items using Gramian estimation. This is achieved by having two separate neural networks defined for each item to be compared, which are then combined via a dot product. The proposed innovation in this paper is to use Gramian estimation for the penalty parameter of the optimization which allows for the non-linear case. Two algorithms are proposed which allow for estimation in the stochastic / online setting. Experiments are presented which appear to show good performance on some standard benchmark tasks. \n\nOverall, I think this is an interesting set of ideas for an important problem. I have two reservations. First, the organization of the paper needs to be addressed in order to aid user readability. The paper often jumps across sections without giving motivation or connecting language. This will limit the audience of the paper and the work. Second (and more importantly), I found the experiments to be slightly underwhelming. The hyperparameters (batch size, learning rate) and architecture don\u2019t have any rationale attached to them. It is also not entirely clear whether the chosen comparison methods fully constitute the current state of the art. Nonetheless, I think this is an interesting idea and strong work with compelling results. \n\nEditorial comments:\n\nThe organization of this paper leaves something to be desired. The introductions ends very abruptly, and then appears to begin again after the related work section. From what I can tell the first three sections all constitute the introduction and should be merged with appropriate edits to make the narrative clear.\n\n\u201cwhere x and y are nodes in a graph and the similarity is wheter an edge\u201d \u2192 typo and sentence ends prematurely. \n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}
