{"title": "Experimental results are too preliminary to assess the contribution", "review": "Summary/contribution:\nThis paper focuses on the problem of incorporating uncertainty into RL. The primary contribution is exploring the use of successor features for uncertainty prediction over Q-values. The proposed approach builds on O\u2019Donoghue et al. (2018). The authors provide experiments that demonstrate improved performance on a chain MDP environment and a Tree environment. \n\nPros:\n- I found this paper to be above average in terms of clarity.\n\nCons:\n- The experiments evaluation is restricted to simplistic environments. The authors make an argument for why using successor features would be more \"stable\", but I found the experimental evidence to support this claim to be underwhelming. \n\nJustification for rating:\nThis paper does a good job of articulating an interesting approach to the exploration problem using successor representations.  In the current form however, it is really lacking in experimental evidence to support the main claims/contributions. Currently the domains considered are somewhat toy which I do not find convincing enough to demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach. \n\nOther:\n- I would appreciate a discussion on the relationship to Machado et al. 2018 which explored count based exploration with successor representations.
