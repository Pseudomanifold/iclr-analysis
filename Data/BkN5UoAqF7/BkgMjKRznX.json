{"title": "Efficient imitation learning ", "review": "This paper proposes a new method to imitate expert efficiently. The paper first proposes a way to compute reward function from expert demonstration and uses the log probability to represent this reward function.  Then they find a form of bellman equation that can optimize the reward stably. After the 'Q learning without IRL', an off-policy RL off-pac is applied. So this paper achieves comparable results to GAIL but uses much less data amount. \n\nclarity:\nThis paper is clearly written.\n\noriginality:\nThis paper is original.\n\npros:\nComparable performance with GAIL.\nBetter performance than Behavioral Cloning\nNew way of using demonstrations\n\ncons:\nAlthough both the method and the experiments look promising, there is a very simple yet competitive baseline missing. This baseline is also mentioned in the original GAIL paper: you initialize GAIL with BC, and then train GAIL. That's the baseline for a set of fair comparison.\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
