{"title": "Interesting ideas on domain separation, impressive results on GZSL, but some problems with clarity and comparative evaluation", "review": "This paper describes an approach to domain separation based on bootstrapping to identify similarity cutoff thresholds for known classes, followed by a Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test to refine the bootstrapped in-distribution zones. The authors apply these techniques to two general recognition problems: open-world recognition, and Generalized Zero-shot Learning (GZSL). Experimental results are given on a variety of datasets, and a thorough comparative evaluation on GZSL is performed.\n\nThe paper has the following strong points:\n\n 1. The motivations for each element of the proposed approaches are fairly well presented and are compelling.\n \n 2. The experimental results on GZSL are impressive, especially compared to established approaches.\n\nThe paper also has the following weak points:\n\n 1. The writing is a bit rough throughout, though not to extreme distraction. The abstract starts right off with the awkward \"This paper studies the problem of domain division problem...\" The manuscript needs more careful revision for clarity.\n\n 2. Related to the previous point, there are several elements of the technical exposition that are lacking in clarity. For example, it is unclear what eq. 9 is defining exactly. It seems to be the final decision rule, but it is not clear how seen, unseen, and uncertain samples are determined. Algorithm 1 is clear, but there is never a clear, complete definition of the end-to-end decision pipeline given. I feel like it would be difficult to reproduce the results of this article without significant trial-and-error.\n\n 3. The authors seems to have relied on the Xian et al. paper to extract data for their comparative evaluation on GZSL. There are more recent works from 2018 that should be included, such as:\n\n Arora, Gundeep, Vinay Kumar Verma, Ashish Mishra and Piyush Rai. \u201cGeneralized Zero-Shot Learning via Synthesized Examples.\" CVPR 2018.\n\nIn summary, this paper has many interesting ideas, and the GZSL results are indeed impressive (with respect to the results in the comparison). However, there are many problems with clarity and missing, recent work in the comparative evaluation.\n\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
