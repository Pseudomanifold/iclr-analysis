{"title": "Good but lengthty paper; approach seems solid and results are generally convincing but could show more comparisons and examples", "review": "This paper proposes to introduce a new domain, the uncertain domain, to better handle the division between seen/unseen domains in open-set and generalized zero-shot learning. The approach handles test samples estimated to be from the seen class in one way, and ones that belong to either the unseen or uncertain domain in another way. This idea handles the problem that test instances may incorrectly be attributed to one of the seen classes. The authors evaluate their approach on several relevant datasets against a wide variety of methods for OSL and ZSL, and show convincing results. \n\nI have three concerns. One is that the method sections of the paper are fairly lengthy, including an extensive explanation of prior work, e.g. EVT, so time is spent reading before the reader gets to the interesting part of the proposed method, and this time could be better focused around the contributions of *this* work. \n\nFor the G-ZSL experiments, most of the methods seem to be older methods tackling ZSL not G-ZSL so perhaps more relevant baselines could be found.\n\nOn a related note, it would be good to include some qualitative examples that might reveal some intuitive reasons for the large margin between the performance of the proposed work, and other approaches; in some cases this margin seems rather large, and while the authors attempt to explain it, something beyond a textual explanation might be useful.
