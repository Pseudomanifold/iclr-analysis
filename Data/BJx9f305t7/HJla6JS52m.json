{"title": "Interesting approach to OT GAN for Wasserstein distances with regularised Kantorovitch duals", "review": "\npros\n\n- formal approach to the problem and a clear understanding of what is missing (Section 6.6); I appreciated Section 3 at large in particular.\n\n- I like Theorem 1 and Corollary 1. Is it is possible to reason about an imperfect generator class and undertrained discriminator, and get sufficient conditions for convergence (not necessarily exponential) ?\n\n\ncons\n\n- In Proposition 1, I suspect that p > 2 (see below), which makes the p=2 choice a limit case of the proposition.\n\n- The paper should have cited the paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.05488.pdf which goes along similar lines in its Section 3 and make proper comparisons.\n\n - experimental results do not do a great favour to the technique proposed: in Table 1, W2-OT is not better than Barycentric-OT (see spiral); in Table 2, W2GAN is not better than WGAN-LP; Figure 1-a is maybe the only Figure with a clearcut advantage. However, the CIFAR examples in Figure 1b look quite bad after zooming. Do the authors have more experiments and comparisons on images ?\n\nDetail:\n\n* In proposition 1, (6), use the Holder conjugate of p: ||\\nabla||^{1(p-1)-1} =1/||\\nabla||^{2-q}. Also better to understand as $q\\leq 2$. \n\n* looking at the proof of proposition 1, I do not know how you derive the inverse gradient, but I suspect you need in fact $p>2$, which also implies $q<2$ above.\n\n* Sentence after (10) grammatically incorrect\n\n* In the interpretation of the equation after (16), isn\u2019t is possible to interpret the Jacobian terms as a geometric tweak for the update of G ?\n\n* Lots of mistakes in references: Mistake in the first ref in references, many @JOURNAL/CONF titles do not appear.\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
