{"title": "Not a thorough paper", "review": "The paper aims to come up with a criterion for evaluating the quality of samples produced by a Generative Adversarial Network. The main goal is that the criterion should not reward trivial sample generation algorithms such as the one which generates samples uniformly at random from the samples in the training set. I personally feel that if sample generation is the only goal, then this trivial algorithm is perfectly fine because, statistically, the empirical distribution is in many, though not all, ways, a good estimator of the underlying true probability measure (this is the idea that is used in the statistical technique of Bootstrap for example). However the underlying goal in unsupervised learning problems where GANs are used is hardly sample generation. The GANs also output a whole function in the form of a generative network which converts random samples into samples from the underlying generating distribution. This generative network is arguably more important and more useful than just the samples that it generates. An evaluation scheme for GANs should focus on the generative network directly rather than on a set of its generating samples. \n\nEven if one were to regard the premise of the paper as valuable, the paper still does a poor job meeting its objective. A measure D_CNN is proposed as a benchmark. It must be remarked that D_CNN is not even properly defined (for example, there is a function \\Delta in its definition but it is never explained what this function is). D_CNN is a variant of the existing notion of Neural Network Divergences. Only a numerical study (with no theory) is done to illustrate the utility of D_CNN for evaluating samples generated by GANs. The entire paper is very anecdotal with very little rigorous theory.
