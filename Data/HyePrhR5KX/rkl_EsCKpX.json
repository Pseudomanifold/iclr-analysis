{"title": "An interesting idea which could use clearer theoretical justification and larger scale experimental validation.", "review": "Overall the paper suffers from a lack of clarity in the presentation, especially in algorithm 1, and does not communicate well why the assumption of different dynamical processes should be important in practice. Experiments show some improvement compared to (Trivedi et al. 2017) but are limited to two datasets and it is unclear to what extend end the proposed method would help for a larger variety of datasets. \n\nNot allowing for deletion of node, and especially edges, is a potential draw-back of the proposed method, but more importantly, in many graph datasets the type of nodes and edges is very important (e.g. a knowledge base graph without edges loses most relevant information) so not considering different types is a big limitation. \n\nComments on the method (sections 2-4).\n\nAbout equation (1):\n \\bar{t} is not defined and its meaning is not obvious. The rate of event occurrence does not seem to depend on l (links status) whereas is seems to be dependent of l in algorithm 1. \n\nI don\u2019t see how the timings of association and communication processes are related, both \\lambda_k seem defined independently. Should we expect some temporal dependence between different types of events here? The authors mention that both point processes are \u201crelated through the mediation process and in the embedding space\u201d, a more rigorous definition would be helpful here. \n\nThe authors claim to learn functions to compute node representations, however the representations z^u seem to be direct embeddings of the nodes. If the representations are computed as functions it should be clear what is the input and which functional form is assumed.\n\nI find algorithm 1 unclear and do not understand how it is formally derived, its justification seems rather fuzzy. It is also unclear how algorithm 1 relates to the loss optimisation presented in section 4. \n\nWhat is the mechanism for addition of new nodes to the graph? I don\u2019t see in algorithm 1 a step where nodes can be added but this might be handled in a different part of the training. \n\nComments on the experiments section.\n\nSince the proposed method is a variation on (Trivedi et al. 2017), a strong baseline would include experiments performed on the same datasets (or at least one dataset) from that paper. \n\nIt is not clear which events are actually observed. I can see how a structural change in the network can be observed but what exactly constitutes a communication event for the datasets presented?\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
