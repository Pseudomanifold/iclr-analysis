{"title": "Review", "review": "This paper proposes a benchmark for for reinforcement learning to study generalization in stationary and changing environments. A combination of several existing env. from OpenAi gym is taken and several ways to set this parameters is proposed. Paper provides a relatively thorough study of popular methodologies on this benchmark.\n\nOverall, I am not sure there is a pressing need for this benchmark and paper does not provide an argument why there is an urgent need for one.\n\nFor instance, paragraph 3 on page 1 details a number of previous studies. Why those benchmarks are in-adequate?\nOn page at the end of second paragraph a  number of benchmarks from transfer learning literature is mentioned. Why not just use those and disallow model updates?\nIn the same way, it is not clear why new metric is introduced? How does it correlate with standard reward metrics?\n\nOverall, as empirical study, I think this work is interesting but I think paper should justify why we need this new benchmark.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
