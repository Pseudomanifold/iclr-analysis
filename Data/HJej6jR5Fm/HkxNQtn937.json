{"title": "review", "review": "To my knowledge, this paper is probably the first one to apply few-shot learning concept into high-level computer vision tasks. In this paper's sense, segmentation. It proposes a general framework to few from the very few sample, extract a latent representation z, and apply it to do segmentation on a query. Cases of semantic, interactive and video segmentation are applied. Experiments are very thorough.\n\nWe see too many variants of few-shot learning papers on mini-imagenet or omniglot. For the reason of applying to high-level segmentation, the paper already deserves an acceptance for the first work. I believe this work would inspire many follow-ups in related domain (especially for high-level vision tasks)\n\nComments:\n\n- what is interactive segmentation? I looked through the related work, it just mentioned some previous work without defining or describing it.\n\n- z is the network output of g? is there any constraint on z? Like Gaussian distributions like what z is like in VAE models. \n\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
