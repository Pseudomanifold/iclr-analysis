{"title": "A great paper and a solid contribution to computational neuroscience", "review": "I enjoyed reading this paper which is a great example of solid computational neuroscience work.\n\nThe authors trained CNNs under various biologically-motivated constraints (e.g., varying the number of units in the layers corresponding to the retina output to account for the bottleneck happening at the level of the optic nerve or varying the number of \"cortical\" layers to account for differences across organisms). The paper is clear, the hypotheses clearly formulated and the results are sound. The implications of the study are quite interesting suggesting that the lack of orientation selectivity in the retina would arise because of the bottleneck at the level of the optic nerve. The continuum in terms of degree of linearity/non-linearity observed across organisms at the level of the retina would arise as a byproduct of the complexity/depth of subsequent processing stages. While these results are somewhat expected this is to my knowledge the first time that it is shown empirically in an integrated computational model.\n\nMinor point: The authors should consider citing the work by Eberhardt et al (2016) which has shown that the exists an optimal depth for CNNs to predicting human category decisions during rapid visual categorization.\n\nS.
