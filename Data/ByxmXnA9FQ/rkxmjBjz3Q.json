{"title": "new method approximating the distribution of classification probability", "review": "This paper provides a new method that approximates the confidence distribution of classification probability, which is useful for novelty detection. The variational inference with Dirichlet family is a natural choice.\n\nThough it is principally insightful to introduce the \u201chigher-order\u201d uncertainty, I do see the fundamental difference from the previous research on out-of-distribution detection (Liang, Lee, etc.). They are aimed at the same level of uncertainty.  Consider a binary classier, the only possible distribution of output y is Bernoulli- a mixture of Bernoulli is still Bernoulli.   \n\nIn ODIN paper,  the detector contains both the measurement of the extent to which the largest unnormalized output of the neural network deviates from the remaining outputs (U1 in their notation) and another measurement of the extent to which the remaining smaller outputs deviate from each other (U2 in their notation).  In this paper, the entropy term has the same flavor as U2 part?\n\nI am a little bit concerned with the VI approach, which introduces extra uncertainty.  I do not understand why there is another balancing factor eta in equation 6, which makes it no longer a valid elbo. Is the ultimate goal to estimate the exact posterior distribution of p(z) through VI, or purely some weak regularization that enforces uniformity?  Could you take advantage of some recent development on VI diagnostics and quantify how good the variational approximation is?\n\nIn general, the paper is clear and well-motivated, but I find the notation sometimes confusing and inconsistent. For example, the dependency on x and D is included somewhere but depressed somewhere else.  alpha_0 appears in equation 4 but it is defined in equation 7. \n\nI am impressed by the experiment result that the new method almost always dominates best known methods, previously published in ICLR 2018. But I am not fully convinced why it works theoretically.  I would recommend a weak accept.  \n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
