{"title": "Model has high bias and low variance ", "review": "The paper proposes a framework for data-dependent DNN regularization which claimed to be capable of producing highly discriminative features residing in orthogonal-low-rank subspaces. The main claim is that the proposed regularization makes the neural network not memorizing from the training data and motivate learning the intrinsic patterns.  The experiments were done with three image dataset. \n\nThe main problem with this paper is the low training accuracy, but the high testing accuracy (Table 1). This implies that the model has a high bias and low variance. Intuitively the model is consistently predicting a wrong target function (probably from the self-validation).\n\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
