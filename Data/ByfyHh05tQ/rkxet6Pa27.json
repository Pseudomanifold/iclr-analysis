{"title": "RNA sequence design with deep reinforcement learning", "review": "This work tackles the difficult RNA design problem, i.e. that of finding a RNA primary sequence that is going to fold into a secondary/tertiary structure able to perform a desired biological function. More specifically, it used Reinforcement Learning (RL) to find the best sequence that will fold into a target secondary structure, using the Zuker algorithm and designing a new primary sequence 'from scratch'. A new benchmark data set is also introduced in the paper along .\n\nQuestions/remarks:\n - I struggle with your notations as soon as section 2.1. What is the star (*) superscript for? Was expecting the length of the RNA sequence instead. Same on p4, when introducing the notation of your decision process $ D_w $, explicitly introduce all the ingredients.\n - in Equation (2) on p4, maybe clarify the notation with '.', '(' and ')' for example as the reader could really struggle.\n - I didn't really understand the message in Section 4, not being an expert in the field. Could you clarify your contribution here?\n - your 'Ablation study' in Section 5.2; does it correspond to true uncertainty/noise that could be observed in real data?\n - why a new benchmark data set, when there exist good ones to compare your method to, e.g. in competitions like CASP for proteins?\n - do you make your implementation available?\n - quite like the clarification of the relationship of your work to that of Eastman et al. 2018. Could you also include discussions to other papers, e.g. Chuai et al. 2018 Genome Biol and Shi et al. 2018 SentRNA on arXiv?\n\nAltogether the paper reads well, seems to have adequate references, motivates and proposes 3 variations of a new algorithm for a difficult learning problem. Not being an expert in the field, I just can't judge about the novelty of the appraoch.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess"}
