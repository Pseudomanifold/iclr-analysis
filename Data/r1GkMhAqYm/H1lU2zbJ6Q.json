{"title": "Mostly a dataset paper, writing is not coherent, results are not convincing", "review": "In this paper a new task namely CoDraw is introduced. In CoDraw, there is a teller who describes a scene and a drawer who tries to select clip art component and place them on a canvas to draw the description. The drawing environment contains simple objects and a fixed background scene all in cartoon style. The describing language thus does not have sophisticated components and phrases. A metric based on the presence of the components in the original image and the generated image is coined to compute similarity which is used in learning and evaluation.  Authors mention that in order to gain better performance they needed to train the teller and drawer separately on disjoint subsets of the training data which they call it a cross talk.\n\nComments about the task:\nThe introduced task seems to be very simplistic with very limited number of simple objects. From the explanations and examples the dialogs between the teller and drawer are not natural. As explained the teller will always tell \u2018ok\u2019 in some of the scenarios. How is this different with a system that generates clip art images based on a \u201cfull description\u201d? Generating clip arts based on descriptions is a task that was introduced in the original clip art paper by Zitnick and Parikh 2013. This paper does not clarify how they are different than monologs of generating scenes based on a description.  \n\nComments about the method:\nI couldn\u2019t find anything particularly novel about the method. The network is a combination of a feed forward model and an LSTM and the learning is done with a combination of imitation learning and REINFORCE. \n\n\nComments about the experimental results:\nIt is hard to evaluate whether the obtained results are satisfying or not. The task is somehow simplistic since there a limited number of clip art objects and the scenes are very abstract which does not have complications of natural images and accordingly the dialogs are also very simplistic. All the baselines are based on nearest neighbors. \n\nComments about presentation:\nThe writing of this paper needs to be improved. The current draft is not coherent and it is hard to navigate between different components of the method and different design choices. Some of the design choices are not experimentally proved to be effective: they are mentioned to be observed to be good design choices. It would be more effective to show the effect of these design choices by some ablation study. \nThere are many details about the method which are not fully explained: what are the details of your imitation learning method? Can you formalize your RL fine-tuning part with the use of some formulations? With the current format, the technical part of the paper is not fully understandable.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
