{"title": "Solid Paper", "review": "This paper proposes a new method to embed a graph onto a product of spherical/Euclidean/hyperbolic manifolds. The key is to use sectional curvature estimations to determine proper signature, i.e., all component manifolds, and then optimize over these manifolds. The results are validated on various synthetic and real graphs. The proposed idea is new, nontrivial, and is well supported by experimental evidence.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}
