{"title": "a tree extension to previous work rSLDS", "review": "This paper introduces a probabilistic model to model nonlinear dynamic systems with multiple granularities. The nonlinearity is achieved by using multiple local linear approximations. The method is an extension to rSLDS (recurrent switching linear dynamical systems),  which in turn is an extension to SLDS. \n\nPros:\n1. Introducing the tree structure is a neat way of extending the existing rSLDS model to multiscale scenarios. \n2. The paper is written clearly. The background is well illustrated and the idea rises naturally from there. The paper is also solid in the part describing the model. \nCon:\n1. from the rSLDS paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.08466.pdf), the authors there was experimenting with some settings similar to those used in this paper. However, I am not able to find some explicit comparison between the TrSLDS and rSLDS in this work. I think it should be needed since TrSLDS itself is derived out from rSLDS, it would be good to show explicitly the advantage of the new model.\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}
