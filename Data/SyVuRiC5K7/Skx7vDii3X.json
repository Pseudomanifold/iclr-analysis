{"title": "interesting empirically", "review": "This paper proposes to address few-shot learning in a transductive way by learning a label propagation model in an end-to-end manner.  Semi-supervised few-shot learning is important considering the limitation of the very few labeled instances. This is an interesting work. \n\nThe merits of this paper lie in the following aspects: (1) It is the first to learn label propagation for transductive few-shot learning. (2) The proposed approach produced effective empirical results.\n\nThe drawbacks  of the work include the following: (1) There is not much technical contribution. It merely just puts the CNN representation learning and the label propagation together to perform end-to-end learning. Considering the optimization problem involved in the learning process, it is hard to judge whether the effect of such a procedure from the optimization perspective.  (2) Empirically, it seems TPN achieved very small improvements over the very baseline label propagation.  Moreover, the performance reported in this paper seems to be much inferior to the state-of-the-art results reported in the literature. For example,  on miniImageNet, TADAM(Oreshkin et al, 2018) reported 58.5 (1-shot) and 76.7(5-shot), which are way better than the results reported in this work. This is a major concern.\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
