{"title": "Transductive few-shot by meta-learning to propagate labels for . Solid work.", "review": "The paper studies few-host learning in a transductive setting: using meta learning to learn to propagate labels from training samples to test samples. \n\nThere is nothing strikingly novel in this work, using unlabeled test samples in a transductive way seem to help slightly. However, the paper does cover a setup that I am not aware that was studied before. The paper is written clearly, and the experiments seem solid. \n\nComments: \n-- What can be said about how computationally demanding the procedure is? running label propagation within meta learning might be too costly. \n-- It is not clear how the  per-example scalar sigma-i is learned. (for Eq 2)\n-- solving Eq 3 by matrix inversion does not scale. Would be best to also show results using iterative optimization \n\n\n\n\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
