{"title": "New approximate inference approaches for phylogenetic trees", "review": "This paper explores an approximate inference solution to the challenging problem of Bayesian inference of phylogenetic trees. Its leverages recently proposed subsplit Bayesian networks (SBNs) as a variational approximation over tree space and combines this with modern gradient estimators for VI. It is thorough in its evaluation of both methodological considerations and different datasets.\n\nThe main advantage would seem to be a large speedup over MCMC-based methods (Figure 4), which could be of significant value to the phylogenetics community. This point would benefit from more discussion. How do the number of iterations (reported in Figures 3&4, which was done carefully) correspond to wallclock time? Can this new method scale to numbers of sites and sequences that were previously unfeasible?\n\nThe main technical contribution is the use of SBNs as variational approximations over tree-space, but it is difficult to follow their implementation and parameter sharing without the explanation of the original paper. Additionally, the issue of estimating the support of the subsplit CPTs needs more discussion. As the authors acknowledge, complete parameterizations of these models scale in a combinatorial way with \u201call possible parent-child subsplit pairs\u201d, and they deal with this by shrinking the support up front with various heuristics. It seems that these support estimation approaches would be feasible when the data are strong but would become challenging to scale when the data are weak. Since VB is often concerned with the limited-data regime, more discussion of when support estimation is feasible and when it is difficult would clarify how widely applicable the method is.\n\nOverall, this work is an interesting extension of variational Bayes to a tree-structured inference problem and is thorough in its evaluation. While it is a bit focused on classical inference for ICLR, it could be interesting both for the VI community and as a significant application advancement.\n\nOther notes:\nIn table 1, is the point that all methods are basically the same with different variance? This is not clear from the text. What about the variational bounds?\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
