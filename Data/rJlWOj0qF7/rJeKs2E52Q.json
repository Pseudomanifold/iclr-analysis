{"title": "Interesting task but weak evaluation mainly dominated by qualitative analysis", "review": "This paper focuses on adjusting the pretrained word embeddings so that they respect the hypernymy/hyponymy relationship by appropriate n-ball encapsulation. They propose to do so by augmenting the word embeddings with information from a resource like Wordnet and applying 3 kinds of geometric transformations to enforce the encapsulation.\n\nThe motivation of doing this is not very clear and experimental results are mainly qualitative (and subjective) showing that hypernymy relation can be predicted and preserved by their adjustment. Since, this work relies on Wordnet, the coverage of vocabulary is severely limited and as the authors discus in the results with the section titled \"Experiment 3: Method 2\", they had to remove many words in the standard semantic similarity datasets which casts shadow on the usefulness of the proposed approach. It is unclear what the main contribution of such an approach.\n\nApart from this, the paper is diffcult to read and some parts (especially those pertaining to Figure 3) encode a simple concept that has been expressed in a very complicated manner.\n\nOverall, I give a score of 4 because of the limited coverage of the approach because of reliance on Wordnet and inadequate empirical evidence of usefulness of this approach.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
