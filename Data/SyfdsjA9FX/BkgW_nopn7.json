The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified qualitatively and quantitatively. Although the novelty of the method is not impressive, the proposed method seems to be useful for face-related applications and the experimental results are convincing to me.\n\nPros:\n- This method is simple, apparently effective and is a nice use of adversarial encoder-decoder for a practical task. The paper is written clearly and the English is fine.\n\nCons:\n- My main concern with this paper is regarding the novelty. The authors seem to claim a novel GAN architecture by using an auto-encoder-based network architecture with a pre-trained face recognition network and multi-image perceptual loss. However, it is not clear to me what aspect of their GAN is particularly new.\n\n- Missing experimental comparisons with state-of-the-arts. The most recent work that compared in the Experiment section is the work of Samarzija & Ribaric (2014). Detailed experimental comparisons with more recent state-of-the-arts are needed to justify the superiority of the proposed method.\n\n- Missing ablation study and more in-the-wild comparisons in the Experiment section. The proposed framework contains several modules, an ablation study is needed to verify the separate contribution of each component. Moreover, more in-the-wild qualitative and quantitative experiments on recent benchmarks with large facial variations (e.g., expression, occlusion, blur, etc.) are needed to verify the efficacy of the proposed method.\n\nAdditional comments:\n- How did authors update each component and ensure stable yet fast convergence while optimising the whole GAN-based framework? \n\n- How did authors choose the value of \\alpha in Eq. (2-4)?", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
