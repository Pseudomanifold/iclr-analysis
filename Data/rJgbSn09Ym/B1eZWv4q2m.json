{"title": "Impressive work", "review": "This work demonstrates that a particle dynamics model can be learned to approximate the interaction of various objects. The resulting differentiable simulator has a strong inductive bias, which makes it possible to efficiently solve complex manipulation tasks over deformable objects.\n\n# Quality\n\nThis work is an impressive proof-of-concept of the capabilities of differentiable programming for learning complex (physical) processes, such as particle dynamics. In my opinion, the resulting particle interaction network would deserve publication for itself. However, this work goes already one step further and demonstrates that the resulting differentiable simulator can be used for the manipulation of deformable objects.\n\nThe method is evaluated on a well-rounded set of experiments which demonstrates its potential. More real-world experiments would be welcome to leave any doubt.\n\nEDIT: However, the current manuscript lacks a proper comparison with (cited) previous work, such as 1806.08047. \n\n# Clarity\n\nThe paper is well written, although I do feel it was difficult to remain within the 8-page limit given the breadth of the work.\n\n# Originality\n\nAs far as I know, this work is (very) original. (That being said, I am not too familiar with the related work.)\n\nEDIT: This work is actually quite similar to 1806.08047. A proper discussion of the differences should be included. \n\n# Significance\n\nThis work will certainly be of interest for several research communities, including deep learning, physics, control and robotics.\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
