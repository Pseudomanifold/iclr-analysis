{"title": "Meta-Learning Language-Guided Policy Learning", "review": "Summary:\nThis paper studies how to teach agents to complete tasks via natural language instructions in an iterative way, e.g., correct the behavior of agents. This is a very natural way to learn as humans. The basic idea is to learn a model that takes correction and history as inputs and output what action to take. This paper formulates this in meta-learning setting in which each task is drawn from a pre-designed task distribution and then the models are able to adapt to new tasks very fast. The proposed method is evaluated in a virtual environment where the task is to pick up a particular object in a room and bring it to a particular goal location in a different room. There are two baselines: 1) instruction only (missing information), 2) full information (not iterative), the proposed method outperforms 1) with higher task completion rate and 2) with fewer number of corrections.\n\nStrength:\n- This paper addresses a very interesting problem in order to make agents learn more human like.\n\nComments:\n- Only one setting is studied. And, the task distribution seems not very complex.\n- How the proposed model performs if the task is a little bit out of distribution?\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
