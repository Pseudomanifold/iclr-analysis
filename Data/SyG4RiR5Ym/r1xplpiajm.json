{"title": "Important clarifications should be given about the task and the model ", "review": "The paper \"Neural Distribution Learning for generalized time-to-event prediction\" proposes HazardNet, a neural network framework for time-to-event prediction with right-censored data. \n \nFirst of all, this paper should be more clear from the begining of the kind of problems it aim to tackle. The tasks the proposal is able to consider is not easy to realize, at least before the experiments part. The problem should be clearly formalized in the begining of the paper (for instance in the introduction of section 3). It the current form, it is very hard to know what are the inputs, are they sequences of various kinds of events or only one type of event per sequence. It is either not clear to me wether the censoring time is constant or not and wether it is given as input (censoring time looks to be known from section 3.4 but in that case I do not really understand the contribution : does it not correspond to a very classical problem where events from outside of the observation window should be considered during training ? classical EM approaches can be developped for this). The problem of unevenly spaced sequences should also be more formally defined. \n\nAlso, while the HazardNet framework looks convenient, by using hazard and survival functions as discusses by the authors, it is not clear to me what are the benefits from recent works in neural temporal point processes which also define a general framework for temporal predictions of events. Approaches such at least like \"Modeling the intensity function of point process via recurrent neural networks\" should be considered in the experiments, though they do not explicitely model censoring but  with slight adapations should be able to work well of experimental data. \n\n\n", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
