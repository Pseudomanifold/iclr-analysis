{"title": "Justifying style transfer via conditioning needs more analysis.", "review": "The introduction is written to perfection. The paper discusses a core failing and need for I2I translation models. The one-to-one mapping assumption does not apply to most tasks. While the approach seems novel the analysis of the results are insufficient to convince me that the method is really working. This should be a workshop paper.\n\nFor the motivation of the approach I am not convinced how the conditioned style is being used. It would be nice to see some analysis of how the latent space changes given different input images. Why would style information be propagated through the network? Why wouldn't noise work just as well? Although an abiliation study is performed there is no standard deviation reported so it is unclear if this number is fair. \n\nIn Figure 5 the t-sne doesn't look correct. The points all seems to be projected on walls which could indicate some sort of overflow error. The text only devotes 3 lines to discuss this figure. It is not mentioned what part of the model the t-sne is computed from. To me this experiment that studies the internal representation is critical to convincing a reader to use this method. \n\nThe segmentation results sound good. Where is the improvement coming from? The experimental section is cut short. The experiment section is really squeezed in the last two pages while the other sections are overly descriptive and could be reduced.\n\nThe figures should be changed to be visible without color (put a texture on each block).\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
