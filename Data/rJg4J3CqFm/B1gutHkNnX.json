{"title": "Very Limited Contribution", "review": "The paper proposes embedding the data into low-dimensional Wasserstein spaces. These spaces are larger and more flexible than Euclidean spaces and thus, can capture the underlying structure of the data more accurately. However, the paper simply uses the automatic differentiation to calculate the gradients. Thus, it offers almost no theoretical contribution (for instance, how to calculate these embeddings more efficiently (e.g. faster or more efficient calculation of the Sinkhorn divergence), how to motivate loss functions than can benefit the structure of the Wasserstein spaces, what the interpretation of phi(x) is for each problem, e. g. word embedding, etc.). Additionally, the experiments are unclear and need further improvement. For instance, which method is used to find the Euclidean embedding of the datasets? Have you tried any alternative loss functions for the discussed problems? Are these embeddings useful (classification accuracy, other distortion measure)? How does the 2-D visualizations compare to DR methods such as t-SNE? What is complexity of the method? How does the runtime compare to similar methods?", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
