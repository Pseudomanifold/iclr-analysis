{"title": "algorithm not guaranteed to work", "review": "Disclosure: I reviewed this paper for a different conference but have read the new manuscript and noted the changes.\n\nSummary:\nThe paper considers a very novel (but important) RL context where the agent has a constrained amount of information for representing a policy.  The authors use techniques from rate-distortion theory to generate a clever Bellman loss function that can be used (1) in a context where V*(s) is already known, and more importantly (2) with an actor-critic architecture (CL-AC) where the value function is being learned online.  CL-AC is shown to actually achieve higher converged and cumulative rewards than AC in many grid world domains and is shown to be advantageous in a transfer learning setting as well.\n\nReview:\n\nThe ideas in the paper are very well described and laid out.  The experiments are on grid worlds but for such a novel problem like this I think they are at the right level because they allow the reader to understand the results.  The empirical results are compelling, but I have a strong technical concern about the convergence issue noted by the authors (which was also communicated to the authors in a previous conference\u2019s review session).  \n\nMy main concern is, as the authors noted, the required state occupation probability p(s) for RDT is approximated in a way that could lead to bad behavior in the RL algorithm.  What we\u2019re seeing here is the application of an RDT procedure that was designed for a static distribution being applied to a dynamic distribution of states (that can change based on the policy).  In RL, there is no guarantee that the previous occupation probabilities have anything to do with the current policy\u2019s induced distribution.  In a hallway world with a decent reward down the left and a bigger reward to the right, an algorithm might start off by going down the left side several times, making the probabilities of states on the right 0.  If I am reading the algorithm right, the states on the right are going to be essentially dismissed as unlikely, and the \u201cgo right\u201d action (which is optimal) will likely be compressed out, since the states it should be used in are considered unlikely.  More succinctly, early trajectories will bias p(s) and cause the algorithm to essentially want to optimize the policy for that distribution, likely causing it to stay in that distribution.  Even more dangerously, there may be cases where this could cause the algorithm to thrash between policies as p(s) oscillates between different parts of the state space.  \n\nIn order to improve this paper and make it suitable for publication, the authors should at least empirically demonstrate how different state occupation probability approximations affect the algorithm.  A good example is the trace-decay probabilities mentioned (but not implemented) in the paper.  If the paper compared that approach to the current approach, and showed an environment where one or both approaches failed to act correctly, that would complete the scientific result. Right now, only one approximation is demonstrated, and as detailed above, its behavior is suspect. \n\nWhile most of the empirical results are well explained, the behavior in Figure 2B, where CL-AC is outperforming standard AC remain unclear. I understand that in 2A (avg. cumulative reward), CL-AC may be inducing a more efficient exploration policy and therefore the rewards during learning will be better.  But in 2B, we are just looking at the final policy.  Was standard AC not able to find the optimal policy after 100 episodes?  \n\nThe results in the transfer learning context (Figure 3) are well done and produce a very interesting curve.  \n\nReference 9 appears to only be available as an arXiv pre-print.  Papers that have not been properly vetted by peer review should not be cited in an ICLR paper unless they are extremely necessary, which this does not appear to be.\n\n\nTypo: Page 6 \u2013 sate -> state\n\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
