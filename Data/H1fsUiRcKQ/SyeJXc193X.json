{"title": "A good paper on combining BadGAN and VAT for SSL", "review": "The authors propose to combine BadGAN framework and VAT to accelerate learning in the semi-supervised setting. The paper shows that the VAT approach is actively pushing the decision boundary away from the high-density regions. While the BadGAN approach pulls the decision boundary to low-density regions. This simultaneous push and pull lead to after convergence in testing accuracy. The authors also report competitive results on standard datasets used for SSL such as SVHN and CIFAR10.\n\nPositives:\nThe approach overcomes some of the difficulties with BadGAN which arise from training a GAN and density estimation network for generating \u201cbad samples\u201d useful for SSL. Instead of using a GAN, the proposed approach uses adversarial samples using VAT that are sufficiently confusing to the current estimate of the classifier. \nThe theoretical justifications for the VAT interpretation are interesting and convincing. The visualizations of the bad samples show qualitatively that the bad samples from the BadGAN and proposed approach differ. Several other visualization aids in understanding the behavior of the algorithm.\n\nNegatives:\nRequires additional hyperparmeter tuning in tau and rho. Tuning these with large validation sets can lead to an overoptimistic estimate of the generalization. How sensitive is the performance to these parameters? \nAs the authors point out, the method has limitations when the number of labeled samples is much smaller. It will be nice to see some results in this aspect.\nPlease include more details to clarify what is meant by \u2018the role of the second term of (1) and (2) are overlapped\u2019.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
