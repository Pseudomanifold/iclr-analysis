{"title": "Interesting investigation but needs work", "review": "\n\n\n\nReview\n\nThis paper discusses invariances in ReLU networks. The discussion is anchored around the observation that while the spectral norm of neural networks layers (their product bounds the Lipschitz constant) has been investigated as a measure of robustness of nets, the smallest singular values are also of interest as these indicate directions of invariance. \n\nThe paper consists mostly of a theoretical analysis with little empirical support, focusing on a property of matrices called omnidirectIonality. The definition given seems weird \u2014 an A \\in R^{m \\times n} is omnidirectional if there exists a unique x \\in R^n such that Ax \\leq 0. \n\nIf there is a *unique* x then that x must be 0. Else if there were a nonzero x for which Ax \\leq 0, then A(cx) also \\leq 0 for any positive scalar 0 and thus x is not unique. Moreover if x must be equal to 0 Ax \\leq 0 and at that point Ax = 0, then that means there exists no x for which Ax < 0, so why not just say this outright? Perhaps a cleaner definition would just be \u201cA is full rank and there does not exist any X such that Ax < 0? Also perhaps better to use the curly sign for vector inequality. \n\nOverall the paper, while interesting is unacceptably messy. \nThe first two pages have no paragraph breaks!!! This means either that the author are separating paragraphs with \\\\ \\noindent or that they have modified the style file to remove paragraph breaks to save space. Either choice is unreadable and unacceptable. The paper is also littered with typos and vague statements (many enumerated below under *small issues*). In this case, they add up to make a big issue. \n\n\nThe notation at the top of page 4 \u2014 see (1) and (2) \u2014 comes out of nowhere and requires explanation. |_{y>0} x + b |_{y>0}  <\u2014 what is the purpose of the subscripts here? Why is this notation never introduced?\n\nUltimately this paper focuses on the question on whether the pre-image of a ReLU layer can be concluded (based on the post-image) to be a singleton,  a compact polytope, or if it has infinite volume. The paper offers some analysis, suggesting when each of the conditions occurs, upper bounds the smallest singular value of D A (where the example dependent diagonal matrix D incorporates the ReLU activation (shouldn\u2019t this be more clearly introduced and notated?). \n\nUltimately this paper is interesting but falls well below the standards of exposition that I expect from a theory paper and doesn\u2019t go very far at connecting the analysis back to the claimed motivation of investigating practical invariances. If the authors significantly improve the quality of the draft, I\u2019ll be happy to revisit it and re-evaluate my score. \n\n\nSmall issues\n\nThe following is a *very* incomplete list of small bugs found in the paper:\n\n\u201cFrom a high-level perspective both of these approaches\u201d --> missing comma after \u201cperspective\u201d\n\n\"as well as the gradient correspond to the highest\npossible responds for a given perturbation\" --> incomprehensible \"corresponding?\" \"possible responds?\" do you mean \"response\", and if so what is the precise technical meaning here?\n\n\"analyzing the lowest possible response\" what does \"response' mean here?\n\n\"We provide upper bounds on the smallest singular value\" -- the singular value of what?
