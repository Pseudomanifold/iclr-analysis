{"title": "Review", "review": "The paper proposes a guider network which utilized unlabeled monolingual data as an augmentation to the usual dual learning framework to improve NMT performance. Furthermore, a deep Q-learning style scheduling algorithm is proposed to optimize the overall architecture.\n\nThe writing of the paper needs a major improvement. As a reviewer, I had a very hard time trying to understand the paper, while the proposed idea turns out to be conceptually simple. A few points regarding the writing:\n1) Figure 1 is impossible to understand, especially that zero explanation is given in the caption.\n2) Too many unnecessary definitions and acronyms such as ISE, CISE, GLF, GDL, AE etc. Essentially, only the notion of bi-direction attention entropy is relevant for the purpose of the paper. Much effort should have been dedicated to explaining the idea of the of bi-direction attention entropy instead of irrelevant terminologies.\n3) No objective function or algorithm description is ever shown.\n\nTechnically, I am skeptical about the use of deep Q-learning as a scheduling algorithm. Usually, a Q-net requires training before it can be deployed in an evaluation environment. However, here the paper seems to suggest that the Q-net is trained and deployed together with the NMT architecture in an online fashion. Why use a Q-net in an online setting is beyond my understanding. Ideally, one would choose a truly online algorithm (i.e. UCB for stochastic bandits) in such scenarios, which I believe would work even better than deep Q-learning in practice.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
