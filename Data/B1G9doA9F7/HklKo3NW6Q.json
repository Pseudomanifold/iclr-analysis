{"title": "Interesting paper", "review": "\nI am putting \"weak accept\" because I think the paper addresses an important problem (domain adaptation) and has an interesting approach.  As the other reviewers pointed out, it's maybe not *super* novel.  But it's still interesting, and pretty readable for the most part.  \n\nI do question the statistical significance of the TIMIT experiments: TIMIT has a very tiny test set to start with, and by focusing on the female portion only you are further reducing the amount.\n\nSmall point: I don't think GANs are technically nonparametric, as the neural nets do have parameters.\n\nI am a little skeptical that this method would have as general applicability or usefulness as the authors seem to think.  The reason is that, since the cycle constraint no longer exists, there is nothing to stop the network from just figuring out the class label of the input (say) image, and treating all the rest of the  information in that image as noise the same way a regular non-cyclic GAN would treat it.  Of course, one wouldn't expect a convolutional network to behave like this, but in theory it could happen in general cases.  This is just speculation though.  Personally I would have tended to accept the paper, but I'm not going to argue with the other reviewers, who are probably more familiar with GAN literature than me.\n\n--\nI am changing from \"marginally above acceptance threshold\" to \"clear accept\" after reading the response and thinking about the paper a bit more.  I acknowledge that the difference from previously published methods is not that large, but I still think it has value as it's getting quite close to being a practical method for generating fake training data for speech recognition.\n", "rating": "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}
