{"title": "I like the idea, but concerns with experimental evaluation", "review": "The authors propose a way to learn models that predict what will happen next in scenarios where action-labels are not available in abundance. The agents extend previous work by proposing a compositional latent-variable model. Results are shown on BAIR (robot pushing objects) and simulated reacher datasets. The results indicate that it is possible to learn a bijective mapping between the latent variables inferred from a pair of images and the action executed between the observations of the two images. \n\nI like the proposed model and the fact that it is possible to learn a bijection between the latent variables and actions is cute. I have following questions/comments: \n\n(a) The authors have to learn a predictive model from passive data (i.e. without having access to actions). Such models are useful, if for example an agent can observe other agents or internet videos and learn from them. In such scenarios, while it would be possible to learn \u201ca\u201d model using the proposed method, it is unclear how the bijective mapping would be learnt, which would enable the agent to actually use the model to perform a task that it is provided with. \nIn the current setup, the source domain of passive learning and target domain from which action-labelled data is available are the same. In such setups, the scarcity of action-labelled data is not a real concern. When an agent acts, it trivially has access to its own actions. So collecting observation, action trajectories is a completely self-supervised process without requiring any external supervision. \n\n(b)  How is the model of Agrawal 2016 used for visual serving? Does it used the forward model in the feature space of the inverse model or something else? \n\n(c) In the current method, a neural network is used for composition. How much worse would a model perform if we simply compose by adding the feature vectors instead of using a neural network. It seems like a reasonable baseline to me. Also, how critical is including binary indicator for v/z in the compositional model? \n\nOverall, I like the technical contribution of the paper. The authors have a very nice introduction on how humans learn from passive data. However, the experiments make a critical assumption that domains that are used for passive and action-based learning are exactly the same. In such scenarios, action-labeled data is abundantly available. I would love to see some results and/or hear the authors thoughts on how their method can be used to learn by observing a different agent/domain and transfer the model to act in the agent\u2019s current domain. I am inclined to vote for accepting the paper if authors provide a convincing rebuttal.
