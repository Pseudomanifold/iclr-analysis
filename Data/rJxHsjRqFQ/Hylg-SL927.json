{"title": "Refreshing approach for matching and aggregating", "review": "The authors propose a novel approach to improve relational-attention by changing the matching and aggregation functions to use hyperbolic geometric. By doing so the network can exploit the metric structure the functions live on.  Method was evaluated and showed improvements over baselines on wide range of tasks including translation, graph learning, and visual question answering.\n\nPros: \n* High quality paper. \n* Hyperbolic matching function is novel and interesting.\n* Even though the subject isn\u2019t trivial, the intuition was described well. \n* The evaluation is comprehensive on several relational related tasks. \n\nCons:\n* Baselines: The authors main contribution is the matching and aggregation operator. It always feels like the multi-modal community is divided between VQA and CLEVR datasets, but there should be a lot in common between them. Specifically, what is called here the matching operator, had several variants in VQA, such as Multimodal Compact Bilinear Pooling by Fukui et al., or Multi-modal Factorized Bilinear Pooling\u00a0by You et al. etc. I think the paper would benefit from adding other variants of matching functions. \n* Datasets: I think the approach might work as well in VQA dataset, which I find more interesting than clever because of the real-world nature of it. You can plug it into methods like MFB, or as pairwise potentials in Structured Attentions\u00a0by Zhu et al, or High-Order attention by Schwartz et al\n\nConclusion:\nA better matching and aggregating operations are always important, it can potentially improve performance in many challenges. The proposed method is novel and interesting, therefore I will be happy to see this paper as part of ICLR.
