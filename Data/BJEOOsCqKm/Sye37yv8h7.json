{"title": "Psychophysical vs. learnt texture representations in novelty detection ", "review": "\n\nThe authors describe an anomaly/novelty detection method based on handcrafted features + VGG based features. \n\nI think the paper is out of the scope of the conference (the only part dealing with learned representations uses VG), plus it addresses a problem whose relevance is not correctly motivated. Finally, the method is quite basic, and is not compared to any state of the art method for novelty detectiobn.  \n\nIn \"... the detection of visual anomalies perceived by human observer is an open challenge\u2026 \" can you provide references of people working in this particular problem?\n\nThe review of related work seems obsolete, can you provide more recent references (in addition to \"historical\" ones). More importantly, please provide references of anomaly detection from textures\n", "rating": "1: Trivial or wrong", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
