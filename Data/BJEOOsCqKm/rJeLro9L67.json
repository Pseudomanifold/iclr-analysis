{"title": "Experimentally Limited", "review": "This paper considers detecting anomalies in textures. For this task they use VGG-19 features and two human-inspired features from Portilla & Simoncelli and Schutt & Wichmann.\nWith these features, they train one-class anomaly detectors. One such anomaly detector is a one-class SVM, and they introduce a loss for one-class neural networks.\n\nThe novelty in this paper comes from the problem setup which I have not seen treated before. The loss function they propose also appears original.\n\nHowever, comparisons are limited. They compare against OC-SVMs, but these are known to be weaker than several types of anomaly detectors [1]. This paper would also do well to ground itself in more recent research on deep anomaly detection [2]. Likewise, the problem setting is limited. In all, experimentation could use more breadth and depth.\n\n[1] Andrew F. Emmott, Shubhomoy Das, Thomas Dietterich, Alan Fern, Weng-Keen Wong.
