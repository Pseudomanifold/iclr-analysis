{"title": "Review", "review": "The authors propose a framework for unsupervised meta-reinforcement learning. This aims to perform meta-learning in reinforcement learning context without an specification of the meta tasks being pre-specified. The authors propose two algorithms to acquire the task distributions (unsupervised). In particular the better performing approach relies on the recently introduced DIAYN algorithm.  Experiments are presented on several simple benchmark datasets.\n\nThe authors propose an interesting formulation of a useful problem: finding tasks automatically that aid meta-learning. To the best of my knowledge this is indeed a novel idea and indeed an important one. On the other hand the authors only take relatively early steps towards solving this task and the discussion of what is a good unsupervised task selection is underwhelming. Indeed one is not left of a clear idea of what kind of inductive biases would be a valid approach to this problem and why the authors consider specifically the two approaches described.    \n\nFor the experiments it seems a lot of the key improvements come from the DIAYN algorithm. The experiments are also presented on relatively toy tasks and mainly compare to RL from scratch approaches.  It would be interesting to see the effectiveness of these methods on harder problems. For the experiments I would be interested to know if one could compare directly to using DIAYN as in the original Eysenbach et al for example as an initialization. \n\nOverall the paper presents several interesting results and I think the high level formulation could have some potential impacts, although the limits  of such an approach are not completely clear and whether it can be effective on complex tasks is not fully known yet.\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
