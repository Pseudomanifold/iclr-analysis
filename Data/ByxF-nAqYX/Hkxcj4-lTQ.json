{"title": "Locally Linear Unsupervised Feature Selection", "review": "This paper focuses on the problem of unsupervised feature selection, and proposes a method by exploring the locally linear embedding. Experiments are conducted to show the performance of the proposed locally linear unsupervised feature selection method. There are some concerns to be addressed.\n\nFirst, the novelty and motivation of this paper is not clear. This paper seems to directly use one existing dimensionality reduction method, i.e., LLE, to explore the local structure of data. Why uses LLE rather than other methods such as LE? What are the advantages?\n\nSecond, in Section 3.3, authors state that the method might be biased due to the redundancy of the initial features. To my knowledge, there are some unsupervised feature selection to explore the redundancy of the initial features, such as the extended work of f Li et al. (2012) \"Unsupervised Feature Selection via Nonnegative Spectral Analysis and Redundancy Control\". \n\nThird, how about the computational complexity of the proposed method? It is better to analyze it theoretically and empirically.\n\nFinally, the equation above Eq. 8 may be wrong.\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
