{"title": "This work proposed variational embedding for knowledge graph inference tasks. However, neither the methods nor the results are really impressive", "review": "\nThis work proposed two variational embedding methods for knowledge graph inference tasks. The experiments show slight improvements compared to other variational embedding methods, e.g., KG2E, TransG, and slight improvement on the WN18 dataset compared with the non-variational method. On the other hand, both the embedding method and the training of variational models used in this work are already well developed. Thus, this work doesn\u2019t show too much novel contribution. However, the reviewer really appreciate the visualization provided in Fig. 4. \nMinor issues:\n1)\tNotation of the KL divergence is not conventional\n2)\tThere are some mistakes of indices for predicates, e.g., in Eq. 7, 8.\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
