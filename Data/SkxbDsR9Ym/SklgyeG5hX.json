{"title": "An OK paper on theoretical understanding the KGE", "review": "In this paper, the author proposed a way to understand the knowledge graph embedding task. More specifically, the authors try to extend the random walk model (Arora et al., 2016a) of word embeddings to KGE.\n\nSome of my detailed comments and questions below.\n\n1. To me, this paper sounds like a direct application of the method of Arora et al., 2016a to KGE. Therefore, this does look like a very obvious application, and it is not clear to me if this paper presents any new methods or if you have obtained any new insights.\n\n2. The paper claims that all prior work use some sort of heuristics in the KGE task, and their approach is a generative account that might deal with this issue? But I personally found that by using random walk and the exp function, you are also making some very strong assumptions that are similar to heuristics? How do you know it is exp function but not other function? \n\n3. I am not sure what the purpose for the evaluation section is. You mention that this paper is not about state-of-the-art results, but if you theory really works, your scoring function should beat SOTA results. \n\nOverall, I have to say that I am very disappointed with this paper, because there are no new theoretical tools being introduced, and the authors seem to be applying Arora et al., 2016a from word embedding to KGE only.
