{"title": "Poorly written paper, with lots of confusing statements and incomplete description of the concepts and references introduced. Very weak contribution.", "review": "This paper is poorly written, and looks like it was not proof-read. \nPresentation of the problem at hand is presented over so many times that it becomes confusing.\nAuthors ought to better define the image description space of the objects and the haptic space. \nMore interesting would have been a good explanation of the different sensors used in the anthropomorphic hand  and the vector built to represent the different sensed objects.\nThe most expected contribution of this work is barely explained: how the haptic sensors' values/object labels vectors were built and fed to the predictor network, what their values looked like for the various objects, how these vectors clustered for the various objects etc.\n\nAmong the many evident weaknesses:\n- Domain specific concepts and procedures of most importance to this work are not explained: \"... measure various physical properties of objects using the bio-tac sensor using five different exploration procedures (EP)\".  Page 3, Paragraph 1. Bio-tac sensor and most importantly exploration procedures (EP) should be presented more clearly.\n- Incomplete and out of nowhere sentences are common: \"The SHAP procedure\nwas established for evaluating prosthetic hands and arms. With this idea in mind, prior work (?)\nbuilt a prosthetic arm which could ...\" Page 4, Paragraph 1.\n- Many references are not well introduced and justified: \"We then trained the network using\nADAM (Kingma & Ba (2014)) with an initial learning rate set to 1e-4.\" Page 4, Paragraph 6. In the same paragraph,  authors explain using \"The groundtruth predictions were per-channel averaged haptic forces\" without having defined those channels (that one can guess but shouldn't). Concepts have to be clearly defined prior to their use.\n\n\n", "rating": "2: Strong rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
