{"title": "exciting research problem, but there are problems in the level of detail in the paper, and the approach taken is not convincing", "review": "This is an exciting research problem, and could be of broad interest in robotics.  The problem posed, and associated data sets and simulation code, if shared, could be an interesting and novel source of challenge to machine learning researchers. \n\nHowever, the paper appears to be a fairly early work in progress, with missing detail in many areas, and making some odd approximations. One concern is the use of averaged haptic readings over a series of explorations, rather than the haptic reading for a specific pose. The approach of averaging seems certain to blur and confound things unnecessarily, making it harder for the system to learn the relationship between pose, object form and sensation.\n\nThe paper itself has weaknesses, e.g. on p5 you say \"When employing the predicted means, this accuracy was a bit lower.\" when you actually have a drop from 99% to 54%! You do not specify which objects are used for this experiment. and in Section 4.2, you do not specify the exploration strategy used. \n\nCan you clarify the explanation of the images in Figure 3 - you say that the image is as in Figure 3, but are you really giving the image of the object AND hand, or just the object itself (if so, you need to change the explanation). \n\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
