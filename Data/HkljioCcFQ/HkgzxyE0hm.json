{"title": "Could this paper be used for other tasks beyond video action understanding?", "review": "This paper considers the problem of weakly-supervised temporal action localization. It proposes a marginalized average attention network (MAAN) to suppress the effect of overestimating salient regions.  Theoretically, this paper proves that the learned latent discriminative probabilities reduce the difference of responses between the most salient regions and the others. In addition, it develops a fast algorithm to reduce the complexity of constructing MAA to O(T^2). Experiments are conducted on THUMOST14 and ActivityNet 1.3.\n\nI like the theoretical part of this paper but have concerns about the experiments. More specifically, my doubts are\n\n- The I3D network models are not trained from scratch. The parameters are borrowed from (Carreira and Zisserman 2017), which in fact make the attention averaging very easy. I don\u2019t know whether the success is because the proposed MAAN is working or because the feature representation is very powerful.\n\n- If possible, I wish to see the success of the proposed method for other tasks, such as image caption generation, and machine translation.  If the paper can show success in any of such task, I would like to adjust my rating to above acceptance.\n\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
