{"title": "Nice contribution within the focus of ICLR", "review": "The authors present a method for generating points clouds with the help of graph convolution and a novel upsampling scheme. The proposed method exploits the pairwise distances between node features to build a NN-graph. The upsampling scheme generates new points via a slimmed down graph convolution, which are then concatenated to the initial node features. The proposed method is evaluated on four categories of the ShapeNet dataset. Resulting point clouds are evaluated via a qualitative and quantitative comparison to r-GAN.\n\nAs far as I know, the paper introduces an overall novel and interesting idea to generate point clouds with localized operations.\n\n\nThe following questions could be addressed by the authors in a revised manuscript:\n\n* The upsampling operation is not well motivated, e.g., neighboring node features are weighted independently, but root node features are not. What is the intuition besides reducing the number of parameters? Are there significant differences when not using diagonal weight matrices?\n* As computation of pairwise node feature distances and graph generation based on nearest neighbors are expensive tasks, more details on the practical running time and theoretical complexity should be provided. Can the complexity be reduced by rebuilding graphs only after upsampling layers? How would this impact the performance of the proposed model?\n* Although the evaluation on four categories is reported, Table 2 only gives results for two categories.\n* How is the method related to GANs which generates graphs, such as GraphGAN or NetGAN?", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
