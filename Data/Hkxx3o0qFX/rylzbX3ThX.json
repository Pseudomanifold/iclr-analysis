The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified qualitatively and quantitatively on CelebA-HQ. The proposed framework can be generalized to several face-related tasks, such as unconstrained face recognition. Although the novelty of the method is not really impressive, the proposed method seems to be useful for face-related applications and the experimental results are convincing to me.\n\nPros:\n- This method is simple, apparently effective and is a nice use of GANs for a practical task. The paper is written clearly and the English is fine.\n\nCons:\n- My main concern with this paper is regarding the novelty. The authors seem to claim a novel GAN architecture by using an adversarial auto-encoder-based architecture. However, it is not clear to me what aspect of their GAN is particularly new.\n\n- Missing experimental comparisons with state-of-the-arts. Detailed experimental comparisons with more state-of-the-arts (e.g., RLA, Zhao et al., TIP 2018, 3D-PIM, Zhao et al., IJCAI 2018) are needed to justify the superiority of the proposed method.\n\n- Missing more in-the-wild comparisons in the Experiment section. This paper mainly performed experiments on CelebA-HQ. More in-the-wild qualitative and quantitative experiments on recent benchmarks with large occlusion variations are needed to verify the efficacy of the proposed method.\n\nAdditional comments:\n- How did authors update each component and ensure stable yet fast convergence while optimising the whole GAN-based framework? \n\n- Can the proposed method solve other challenging in-the-wild facial variations except occlusion? e.g., pose, expression, lighting, noise, etc.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
