{"title": "Review", "review": "The paper proposes a complex generative framework for image completion (particularly human face completion). It aims at solving the following challenges: 1) complete the human face at both low and high resolution; 2) control the attribute of the synthetic content; 3) without the need of complex post-processing. To achieve so, this paper proposes a progressively attentive GAN to complete face image at high resolution with multiple controllable attributes in a single forward pass without post-processing. Particularly it introduces a frequency-oriented attentive module (FAM) to attend on finer details.  \n\nThe method seems interesting, however it seems to make slight change based on ProGAN (ICLR' 18   https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10196). Also similar idea could be found in many other papers, e.g., Wang et al. High-Resolution Image Synthesis and Semantic Manipulation with Conditional GANs, CVPR' 18.  \n\nThe authors should \n1) clarify why this paper makes non-incremental contribution? What are the major novelty compared with these existing works? \n2) why the frequency attention module will yield better results?\n3) Improve the experiment, compared with stronger baselines: consider at least one or two of these state-of-the-art approaches. Also in my opinion model size and training time needs to be compared as well.\n\nAlso the experimental results did not demonstrate better performance of the proposed approach. Why is that?\n\n\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}
