{"title": "review comments on \u201cDynamic Channel Pruning: Feature Boosting and Suppression\u201d ", "review": "This paper propose a channel pruning method for dynamically selecting channels during testing. The analysis has shown that some channels are not always active. \n\nPros:\n- The results on ImageNet are promising. FBS achieves state-of-the-art results on VGG-16 and ResNet-18.\n- The method is simple yet effective.\n- The paper is clear and easy to follow.\n\nCons:\n- Lack of experiments on mobile networks like shufflenets and mobilenets\n- Missing citations of some state-of-the-art methods [1] [2].\n- The speed-up ratios on GPU or CPU are not demonstrated. The dynamic design of Dong et al., 2017 did not achieve good GPU speedup.\n- Some small typos.\n\n[1] Amc: Automl for model compression and acceleration on mobile devices\n[2] Netadapt: Platform-aware neural network adaptation for mobile applications ", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
