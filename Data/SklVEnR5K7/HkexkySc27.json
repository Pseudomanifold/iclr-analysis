{"title": "A paper with technical details and analysis, but the problem addressed does not seems to be interesting and significant", "review": "This paper analyzed on the core factor that make CNNs fail to hold shift-invariance, the naive downsampling in pooling. And based on that the paper proposed the modified pooling operation by introducing a low-pass filter which endows a shift-equivariance in the convolution features and consequently the shift-invariance of CNNs.\n\nPros:\n1.\tThe paper proposed a simple but novel approach to make CNNs shift-invariant following the traditional signal processing principle.\n2.\tThis work gave convincing analysis (from both theoretical illustrations and experimental visualizations) on the problem of original pooling and the effectiveness of the proposed blur kernels.\n3.\tThe experiment gave some promising results. Without augmentation, the proposed method shows higher consistency to the random shifts.\n\nCons:\n1.\tWhen cooperating with augmentation, the test accuracy on random shifted images of proposed method did not exceed the baseline. Although the consistency is higher, it is secondary to the test accuracy of random shifted data. And it is confused to do average on consistency and test accuracy, which are in different scales, and then compare the overall performance on the averages. \n2.\tIt seems to be more convincing if the \u2018random\u2019 test accuracy is acquired by averaging several random shifts on a single image and then do average among images, as well as to show how accuracy various on shifting distance.\n3.\tSome other spatial transforming/shifting adaptive approaches should be taken into consideration to compare the performance.\n4.\tThere are some minor typos, such as line 3 in Section 3.1 and line 15 in Section 3.2\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
