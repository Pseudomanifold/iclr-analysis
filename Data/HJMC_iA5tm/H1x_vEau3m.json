{"title": "review for \"Learning a SAT Solver from Single-Bit Supervision\"", "review": "This paper trains a neural network to solve the satisfiability problems. Based on the message passing neural network, it presents NeuroSAT and trains it as a classifier to predict satisfiability under a single bit of supervision. After training, NeuroSAT can solve problems that are larger and more difficult than it ever saw during training. Furthermore, the authors present a way to decode the solutions from the network's activations. Besides, for unsatisfiable problems, the paper also presents NeuroUNSAT, which learns to detect the contradictions in the form of UNSAT cores.\n\nRelevance: this paper is likely to be of interest to a large proportion of the community for several reasons. Firstly, satisfiability problems arise from a variety of domains. This paper starts with a new angle to solve the SAT problem. Secondly, it uses neural networks in the SAT problem and establishes that neural networks can learn to perform a discrete search. Thirdly, the system used in this paper may also help improve existing SAT solvers.\n\nSignificance: I think the results are significant. For the decoding satisfying assignments section, the two-dimensional PCA embeddings are very clear. And the NeuroSAT's success rate for more significant problems and different problems has shown it's generalization ability. Finally, the sequences of literal votes in NeuroUNSAT have proved its ability to detect unsatisfied cores.\n\nNovelty: NeuroSAT\u2019s approach is novel. Based on message passing neural networks, it trains a neural network to learn to solve the SAT problem. \n\nSoundness: This paper is technically sound. \n\nEvaluation: The experimental section is comprehensive. There are a variety of graphs showing the performance and ability of your architecture. However, the theoretical analysis isn't very sufficient. For instance, why does the change of the dataset from the original SR(n) to SRC(n,u) lead to the change of the behavior of the network from searching for a satisfying assignment indefinitely to detecting the unsatisfiable cores?\n\nClarity: As a whole, the paper is clear. The definition of the problem, the model structure, the data generation, the training procedure, and the evaluation are all well organized. However, there is still a few points requiring more explanation. For instance, in figure 3, I am not sure whether darker value means larger value or smaller value because the authors only mentioned that white represents zero, blue negative and red positive. Also, in figure 7, I am not sure whether those black grids represent higher positive values or lower negative values.\n\nA few questions:\n\nWhat's the initialization of the two vectors the authors use for tiling operation? Does the initialization differ for different types of SAT problems?\n\nHow do the authors decide the number of iterations necessary for solving a particular SAT problem?\n\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
