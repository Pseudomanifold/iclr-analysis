{"title": "incremental", "review": "This paper presents a method for hiding objects from an object detector (e.g. Fast R-CNN or YOLO). This differs from prior work, which mostly focuses on object recognition. They investigate two versions of this idea: they estimate a full-size mask, and they estimate a mask that concatenates together smaller patches (an easier optimization problem with fewer parameters).\n\n- The idea of studying adversarial examples for object detectors is interesting and worthwhile.\n\n- As the paper acknowledges, the methods they use are quite similar to prior work (such as Brown et al.). The contributions (e.g. the \"piled up\" adversarial mask and monochrome masks) are fairly straightforward extensions of prior methods - in this case, applied to detection rather than recognition.  \n\n- The experimental results are not very surprising, given their similarity previous work. The experiments are also not particularly extensive, so there is not much insight to be gained from them (e.g. as an experimental paper).\n\n- The writing is not very clear. The description of the method and experiments are verbose and confusing.\n\nOverall: This is a worthwhile problem, and it is good to see a paper that addresses it. However, I do not think that the paper should be accepted. The writing is confusing, the approach is not very novel, and the experiments are fairly minimal.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
