{"title": "simple method that lacks clear motivation and validations", "review": "This paper is aimed at creating universal adversaries to fool object detectors by learning an image mask using two simple tricks:  piling-up mask patches and monochromatization. Some extensions are also discussed, such as using multiple PR models or partially converged PR models, though without clear motivation.\n\n\nOverall the method used is quite simple and is not sufficiently validated either conceptually or empirically. It remains unclear how to evaluate the proposed method besides plotting out the learned mask. How such adversaries can be useful in improving the performance of deep object detectors is unclear.\n", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
