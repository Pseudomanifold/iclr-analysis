{"title": "A Definition for Interpretability based on MDL Principle", "review": "This paper proposes a definition for interpretability which is indeed the same as model simplicity using the MDL principle. It has several issues:\n\n1) Interpretability is not the same as simplicity or number of model parameters. For example, an MLP is thought to be more interpretable than an RNN with the same number of parameters.\n\n2) The definition of explainability in Eq. (5) is flawed. It should not have the second term L(M(X)|M^o, X) which is the goodness of M^o's fit. You should estimate M^o using that equation and then report L(M^o|M^p) as the complexity of the best estimate of the model (subject to e.g. linear class). Mixing accuracy of estimation of a model and its simplicity does not give you a valid explainability score. \n\n3) In Section 2.4.2, the softmax operator will shrink the large negative coefficients to almost zero (reduces the degrees of freedom of a vector by 1). Thus, using softmax will result in loss of information. In the linear observer case, I am not sure why the authors cannot come up with a simple solution without any transformation.\n\n4) Several references in the text are missing which hinders understanding of the paper.", "rating": "2: Strong rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
