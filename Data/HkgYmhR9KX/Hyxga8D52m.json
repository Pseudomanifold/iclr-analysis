{"title": "novel reward function in adversarial VAT appliation", "review": "This is in a visual active tracking application. The paper proposes a novel reward function - \"partial zero sum\", which only encourages the tracker-target competition when they are close and penalizes whey they are too far.\n\nThis is a very interesting problem and I see why their contribution could improve the system performance. \n\nClarity: the paper is well-written. I also like how the author provides both formulas and a lot of details on implementation of the end-to-end system. \n\nOriginality: Most of the components are pretty standard, however I value the part that seems pretty novel to me - which is the \"partial zero-sum\" idea.\n\nEvaluation: the result obtained from the simulated environment in 2d and 3d are convincing. However, if 1) real-world test and results  2) a stronger baseline can be used, that would be a stronger acceptance.
