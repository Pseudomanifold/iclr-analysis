{"title": "We found this work interesting. We think that some issues need to be further addressed by the authors.", "review": "The main contributions of this work are essentially on the theoretical aspects. It seems that the proposed algorithm is not very original because its two parts, namely prediction (coefficient estimation) and learning (dictionary update) have been widely used in the literature, using respectively a IHT and a gradient descent. The authors need to describe in detail the algorithmic novelty of their work.\n\nThe definition of \u201crecovering true factor exactly\u201d need to be given. The proposed algorithm involves several tuning parameters, when alternating between two updating rules, an IHT-based update for coefficients and a gradient descent-based update for the dictionary. Therefore, an appropriate choice of their values need to be given.\n\nIn the algorithm, the authors need to define the HT function in (3) and (4).\n\nIn the experiments, the authors compare the proposed method to only the one proposed by Arora et al. 2015. We think that this is not enough, and more extensive experimental results would provide a better paper. \n\nThere are some typos that can be easily found, such as \u201cof the out algorithm\u201d.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}
