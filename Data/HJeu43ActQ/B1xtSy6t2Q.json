{"title": "Interesting paper, clear contribution. More intuition would be great.", "review": "The paper deals with the problem of recovering an exact solution for both the dictionary and the activation coefficients. As other works, the solution is based on a proper initialization of the dictionary. The authors suggest using Aurora 2015 as a possible initialization. The contribution improves Arora 2015 in that it converges linearly and recovers both the dictionary and the coefficients with no bias.\n\nThe main contribution is the use of a IHT-based strategy to update the coefficients, with a gradient-based update for the dictionary (NOODL algorithm). The authors show that, combined with a proper initialization, this has exact recovery guaranties. Interestingly, their experiments show that NOODL converges linearly in number of iterations, while Arora gets stuck after some iterations.\n\nI think the paper is relevant and proposes an interesting contribution. The paper is well written and the key elements are in the body. However, there is a lot of important material in the Appendix, which I think may be relevant to the readers. It would be nice to have some more intuitive explanations at least of Theorem 1. Also, it is clear in the experiments the superiority with respect to Arora in terms of iterations (and error), but what about computational time?", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}
