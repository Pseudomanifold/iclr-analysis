{"title": "Extensive experiments but limited novelty", "review": "This paper developed a generative model to perform simultaneous embedding/generation of images/texts, with application to zero-shot learning. The experiments are extensive.\n\nThe novelty of this work is lacking.\nThe proposed method consists of a bag of existing models proposed by previous works.\nBut why using a certain model is not justified or explanined.\nFor example, for image generation, why use GAN instead of VAE.\nFor text encoding, why use PGBN, instead of recurrent VAE.\n\nThe method seems deteched from the problem of ZSL.\nThroughout the paper, the authors mostly talk about how to perform joint embedding of texts and images. They give ZSL a touch, but as a side thing.\nI would suggest the authors to position this work as a text/iamge embedding/generation work. Then use ZSL as an application.\n\nThe writing needs to be significantly improved. In the first paragraph describing the problem of ZSL, the authors end up with talking about the evaluation metric of ZSL.\n\n\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
