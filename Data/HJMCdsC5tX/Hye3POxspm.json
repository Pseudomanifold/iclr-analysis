{"title": "A heuristic method for time series periodicity detection; topic not matching scope of ICLR", "review": "The authors present a heuristic method to detect periodicity in time series. It extends a previous approach in dealing with noise and the setting of multiple periodicities.\n\nThe topic does not match the scope of ICLR and would be better suited for a different venue.\n\nThe method is demonstrated in a purely experimental fashion. However, without detailed inspection of the datasets it remains unclear in what cases the heuristics apply and where they fail. A more thorough analysis of the robustness of the algorithm is necessary, in particular a detailed presentation of failure cases.", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
