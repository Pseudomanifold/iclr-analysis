{"title": "An ad-hoc method for period detection. Possibly unfit for this conference", "review": "This paper introduces a method to do period detection. It builds off of the autoperiod method by adding density clustering, a lowpass filter, and a linear detrending after auto correlation.\n\nThe results section was very vague. The process of  generating the synthetic signals was not specific. There were no visualizations, which would help the reader understand how this method performs better. Visualizations would have been especially useful for the real datasets.\n\nHaving said this, I don't think this paper is fit for this conference.", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}
