{"title": "Generalize mirror descent to infinite dimensional spaces. No really new theory or practice insight.", "review": "This paper proposes to consider the mixed equilibrium objective function for GANS. The authors generalize the mirror descent/mirror prox to handle continuous games. The technical challenge is to write those algorithms in infinite dimensional spaces. This reviewer finds this however to be a mere technicality, and there seems to be no conceptual obstruction. In fact other paper have already written this, see for example ``Mirror Descent Learning in Continuous Games\" by Zhou et al. at CDC 2017 (I'm sure there are other references too).\nWhile the theory part is not particularly exciting, the paper could be saved by the experiments. However as far I can tell the authors are only able to reproduce the results obtained with more classical approaches.\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
