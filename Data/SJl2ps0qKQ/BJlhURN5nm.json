{"title": "Interesting idea. Lacking technical details and error analysis.", "review": "This paper proposes a knowledge-based QA system that learns to decompose compound questions into simple ones. The decomposition is modeled by assigning each token in the input question to one of the partitions and receiving reward signal based on the final gold answer. The model achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the MetaQA dataset. \n\nMy main complaint about the paper is its lack of technical details and analysis of empirical results. Parts of the paper seem quite unclear, for example:\n\nIn the last paragraph of Section 3.1, it says \u201cWe do not assume that nay question should be divided into exactly three parts. \u2026 See section 4 for case study.\u201d Does this mean that the model can have <=3 partitions, but not more? How is this number decided?\n\nSection 3.2 describes the simple-question answer. From Eq (4), it seems that the answerer only uses the current partition, is that the case? Moreover, how is the gold relation r obtained?\n\nIt would be nice to add more explanation to the caption of Figure 4 to make it self-contained.\n\nThe case study section (4.3) only contains a single example. It would be very helpful to include more examples of question partitions (there is enough space). Error analysis would also be helpful to understand, for example, why the proposed model is worse than VRN (Zhang et al. 2017) on 1- and 2-hop questions.\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
