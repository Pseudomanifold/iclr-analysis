{"title": "Good problem formulation, Not Novel method.", "review": "This paper formulated the problem of unsupervised one-to-many image translation and addressed the problem by minimizing  the mutual information. A principle formulation of such problem is quite interesting. However, the novelty of this paper is limited. The proposed the method is a simple extension of InfoGAN, applied to image-to-image translation and replacing the mutual information part with MINE.\n\nThe experiments, which only include edge to shoes and MNIST to SVHN, are also not comprehensive and convincing. This paper also lacks discussion of several quite important related references for one-to-many image translation.\n\nXOGAN: One-to-Many Unsupervised Image-to-Image Translation\nToward Multimodal Image-to-Image Translation\n\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
