{"title": "simple algorithm, intriguing message", "review": "This paper demonstrates that a simple greedy random search algorithm in DCT space based on score feedback is able to synthesize adversarial examples with quite good query efficiency.  The algorithm is demonstrated on ImageNet  with three common architectures, showing much higher efficiency when sampling from the DCT basis. The algorithm is also shown to outperform state of the art attacks in terms of query count. Finally, a successful attack is demonstrated on Google Cloud Vision.\n\nWhile not particularly heavy on technicalities, this work does make a couple intriguing points, namely that adversarial attacks can potentially be quite easy to perform due to the inherent nature of high-dimensional classification, and that the space is in which the search is perform might be more important than the sophistication of the search itself. I interpret the proposal not so much as a claim to a state-of-the-art algorithm (even though the results are impressive) but as a very reasonable baseline in the evaluation of attack efficiency -- one might even wonder why it has not been common practice thus far to evaluate against such kinds of algorithms by default. \n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
