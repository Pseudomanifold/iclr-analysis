{"title": "simple and effective blackbox attack based on random directions", "review": "This paper presents a simple and effective black box adversarial attack on sota deep nets for image classification tasks. It is based on randomly picking a low frequency component of the DC Transform.  It is claimed to be most efficient when compared to the sota methods in terms of number of queries required for the attack. It is shown that a median of 600 queries for resnet-50 for imagenet dataset, and 2500 for google cloud vision. Due to its simplicity, it is also claimed that the attack is quite simple to implement in code. The paper presents a detailed analysis of their attack in pixel and DCT space, targeted vs untargeted attack, comparison over different architecture such as Densenet, resnet, and inception.\n\nThough the work is quite important and presents a simple and effective baseline black box attack. My concern is primarily on the novelty and originality of the idea, as it is mainly based on the work of Guo etal 2018, which this paper says is the motivation behind their work. So, it is not clear what is the contribution of this paper, as a similar study seems to have been carried out in that paper as well. The authors do not clearly give the relative comparison wrt Guo etal 2018.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
