{"title": "a pruning-with-hints framework for model acceleration", "review": "In this paper, the authors propose a pruning-with-hints framework for model acceleration.  Via performing pruning and hints iteratively, one can leverage the complementary characteristics of these two approaches to boost performance. \n\nHere are the comments:\n1 The framework seems to be technically sound. However, the novelty is limited. Most techniques (e.g., pruning, hints) have been widely investigated in the literature. Reconstruction can be treated as another type of hints. Furthermore, the integration of these strategies is standard.\n2 In the experiment, the pruning rate is relatively low for larger models and data sets.  Hence, the effectiveness should be further investigated.  Additionally, please compare with the state-of-the-art approaches such as light-weight design (e.g., MobileNet, ShuffleNet).  This can further enhance the motivation of choosing the proposed framework for real-life applications. \n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
