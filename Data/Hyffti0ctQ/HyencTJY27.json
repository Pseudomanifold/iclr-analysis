{"title": "interesting combination of two methods but low on novelty", "review": "This paper uses pruning and model distillation iteratively to reduce the model sizes. The pruning step is based on Molchanov et al. (2017). This is followed by a hints step that minimizes the feature map difference between student and teacher. Finally, a reconstruction step is used to restore original weights. Results are shown on CIFAR-10, Imagenet and COCO datasets for classification and pose estimation tasks where PWH reduces model costs with a small loss in accuracy.\n\nThe paper is interesting that it proposes a unique combination of existing methods iteratively to improve the compression rates in modern CNNs. However, given that these methods already exist, the novelty aspect of this paper is low. Furthermore, it is also hard to rebut these methods, since they have been published and extensively evaluated in the respective papers. Nevertheless, it is interesting to note that both methods assist one another in your set of experiments.\n\nIn order to improve the paper and for the reviewers to judge the papers more favorably, the authors can compute the time for reconstruction/hints and demonstrate that it is clearly superior to fine-tuning/re-training and offers a clear advantage. This should be emphasized and articulated in related work and introduction and will help the paper.\n\nHow did you arrive at the magic number of pruning just 256 channels in every step?", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
