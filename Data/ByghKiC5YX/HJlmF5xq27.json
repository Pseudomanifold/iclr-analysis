{"title": "Novel probabilistic framework for making adversarial attacks on deep networks with discrete valued inputs; flexible framework that allows solving the trade-off between attack success rate and computation time", "review": "The authors proposed a novel probabilistic framework to model adversarial attacks on deep networks with discrete inputs such as text. The proposed framework assumes a two step construction of an adversarial perturbation: 1) finding relevant features (or dimensions) to perturb (Eq. 3); 2) finding values to replace the features that are selected in step 1 (Eq. 4). The authors approximate some terms in these two equations to make the optimization easier. For example, it is *implicitly* assumed that given the i-th feature is removed from consideration, the probability of attack success does not change *on average* under probabilistic *adversarial* attack on other features (Eq. 5). It is not clear why that should hold and under what conditions that assumption would be reasonable (given that the attacks on other features are adversarial, although being probabilistic). \nThe proposed framework allows one to solve the computation vs. success rate trade-off by either estimating the best attack from the network (called greedy attack Eq. 6) or using a parametric estimation that does not require model evaluation (called Gumbel attack). Experimental results suggest that Gumbel attack has better or competitive attack rate on models developed for text classification while having the most computationally efficiency among other methods. It is also noticeable that the greedy attack achieves the best success rate with a large margin among all the tested methods.
