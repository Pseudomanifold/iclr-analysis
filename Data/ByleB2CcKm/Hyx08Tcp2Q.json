{"title": "Learning procedural abstractions and evaluating discrete latent temporal structure", "review": "In \"Learning procedural abstractions and evaluating discrete latent temporal structure\" the authors develop a hierarchical Bayesian model for patterns across time in video data. They also introduce new metrics for understanding structure in time series (completeness and homogeneity). This work is appropriate for ICLR. They provide some applications to robotics, suggesting that this could be used to teach robots to act in environments by learning from videos.\n\nThis manuscript paid quite close attention to quality of segmentation, in which actions in videos are decomposed into component parts. It is quite hard to determine groundtruth in such situations and many metrics abound, and so a thorough discussion and comparison of metrics is useful.\n\nThe state of the art for Bayesian hierarchical models for segmentation is Fox et al., which is referenced heavily by this work (including the use of test data prepared in Fox et al.) I wonder why the authors drop the Bayesian nonparametric nature of the hierarchy in the section \"Modeling realizations in each time-series\" (i.e., for Fox et al., the first unnumbered equation in this section would have had arbitrary s).\n\nI found that the experiments were quite thorough, with many methods and metrics compared. However, I found the details of the model to be quite sparse, for example it's unclear how Figure 5 is that much different from Fox et al. But, overall I found this to be a strong paper.\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
