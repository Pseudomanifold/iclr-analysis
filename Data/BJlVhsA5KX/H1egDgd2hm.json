{"title": "More work is needed", "review": "The paper suggests a new way of sampling mini-batches for training deep neural nets. The idea is to first index the samples then select the batches during training in a sequential way. The proposed method is tested on the CIFAR dataset and some improvement on the classification accuracy is reported.\n\nI find the idea interesting but feel that much more is needed in order to have a better understanding of how the proposed method works, when it works and when it doesn't work. Some theoretical insight, or at least a more systematic experimental study, is needed to justify the proposed method.
