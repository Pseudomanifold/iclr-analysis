{"title": "Clearly written and well thought out paper with somewhat lackluster motivation and results ", "review": "This paper presents a new approach to regression via classification problem utilizing a hybrid model between a neural network and a decision tree. The paper is very well written and easy to follow. It presents results on two very similar regression tasks and claims state of the art performance on both.  The paper however does not motivate its contributions sufficiently, and does not provide enough experimental results to justify their method. \n\nThe authors could significantly improve the paper by spending more time motivating their work. For example, it is unclear why RvC is the best strategy for the tasks they study and what other tasks one should approach from a RvC standpoint. The paper would also be significantly more compelling if the strategy was applied to more varied tasks. Furthermore  the two baseline models used are 11 and 34 years old respectively and i do not believe they represent a thorough review of the potential approaches to this problem.  Significant work could also be done to explore the effect of using different neural network structures for the NRT - in this paper only a fairly simple 3 layer architecture is used.  \n\nSection 4.4 is interesting and i believe the paper would be improved if more time was spent exploring the explanability of this new proposed model. \n\nFinally the scan method mentioned in the conclusion could have more emphasis placed on it in the text.  \n\nOver all the paper is well written and easy to follow but is limited by its lack of well detailed motivation and insufficient baselines and applied tasks. \n\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
