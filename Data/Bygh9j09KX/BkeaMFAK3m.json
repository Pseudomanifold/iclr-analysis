{"title": "Interesting idea and  nice demonstration", "review": "This paper talks about the behavior bias between human and advanced CNN classifier when classifying objects. A clear conclusion is that DNN classifiers lean on texture cues more than human, which is in contrast to empirical evidence. The experimental results are delighting and convincing to some extent. This paper is also inspiring and potentially useful to interpret how CNN works in object classification task. \n\nNevertheless, I have several small issues: \n-\tI like the writing of this paper, fluent description and clear topic. Besides, it provides sufficient information about experiment details, thus I think the experiments are fully reproducible. But I want to remind the authors to downplay their claims. Some sentences are not with academic rigor. i.e. \u201cTextures, not object shapes, are the most important cues for CNN object recognition.\u201dI don\u2019t think it a good idea to claim textures as the \u201cmost important\u201dcue.\n-\tAlthough adequate experiments are conducted on ResNet-50 on ImageNet, I miss experiments on a different object classification dataset i.e. PASCAL VOC, and a different network backbone such as very deep ResNet-152 or wider DenseNet. This lies in the concern that a different (deeper or wider) framework may behave quite differently and also the slightly shifted data distribution may induce controversial results. The adopted network ResNet-50, AlexNet, VGG-16 and GoogLeNet are not deep enough or either wide as DenseNet. Although transfer learning experiment is carried out upon PASCAL VOC, it\u2019s not straightforward and not so truly telling. We\u2019re curious about universal conclusions rather than that based on one dataset or network architecture of the same category. As a matter of fact, I\u2019m nearly convinced by the provided results. But I think the demanding experiments will make the conclusions more solid. \n\nBesides, I think the constructed dataset is beneficial to further research or fair comparison of future works, and I wonder the authors\u2019 intention to publish such a dataset in the future. \n\nI would raise my scores if the aforementioned problems are convincingly checked and solved.", "rating": "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
