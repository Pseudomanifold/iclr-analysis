{"title": "Interesting problem & method, but misleading presentation", "review": "The authors present CNNSAT, a CNN-based approach to predict the satisfiability of SAT instances.\nThe problem is very relevant, and the approach is interesting, but unfortunately, the presentation is very misleading (see details below). In terms of methods, the main innovation appears to be the use of CNNs for predicting the solubility of SAT instances, but because of the exchangeability I don't actually see the intuition for this (see details below). Overall, because of these issues, I do not think this paper is ready for publication.\n\nMisleading parts:\n=================\n\n1. Already in the abstract the authors make an utterly wrong statement about SAT solvers: \n\"State-of-the-art solvers exist and have found a wide range of applications.  However, they still do not scale well to formulas with hundreds of variables.\"\nThe same sentiment is repeated in the introduction; I'm puzzled why the authors would believe this. SAT solvers nowadays are routinely used on instances with hundreds of thousands of variables and millions of clauses (just see any of the recent SAT competitions (https://satcompetition.org/) for examples).\n\n2. Z3 is *not* a good solver for random instances, far from state-of-the-art. It is not the right baseline.\n\n3. The authors' approach implicitly makes use of PicoSAT, so their experiments are really implicitly comparing PicoSAT vs. Z3.\n\n4. Comparing the prediction time of CNNSAT with the solving time of Z3 does not make much sense to me, since it does not solve every instance.  \n\n5. No comparison of CNNSAT (internally using PicoSAT) vs. PicoSAT is given.\n\n6. The paper did *not* demonstrate that CNNSAT is competitive in practice. It is only faster than Z3 on random instances, which are not of practical interest. Demonstrating practical usefulness would require competitive performance on the SAT competition instances. By the way, CNNSAT would be disqualified in any SAT competition for falsely returning UNSAT for some satisfiable instances. Algorithm 1 should instead return UNKNOWN when it cannot find a solution.\n\n7. Taken out of context, the predictive quality the authors achieve looks great: between 96% and 99% for random 3-SAT instances. However, this is misleading since the instances are not sampled at the phase transition and may thus be very easy to classify. Usually, for uniform random 3-SAT, the phase transition happens when the number of clauses for a number of variables v exceeds c = 4.258 * v +58.26 * v^{\u22122/3} (see [1]), although I do not remember whether this is for clauses being generated with and without replacement. (I looked into the documentation of CNFGEN, and for random k-cnf, it samples clauses without replacement.) It would be very useful to see the classification accuracy of classifying every formula with >= the number of clauses c from that formula as unsatisfiable and every formula with < that many clauses as satisfiable. Could the authors please report this number during the author response period?\n\nThe authors are also missing an additional related paper: [2] used simple models to obtain better-than-chance predictions at the phase transition.\n\n\n\nExchangeability and the use of CNNs:\n====================================\nDue to the exchangeability property, we do *not* care about spatial correlation in the adjacency matrix. I am really missing the details on how to achieve the fixed-size 100x100 matrices. This approach sounds like it would lose a lot of information!\n\nI do not find the experiment studying exchangeability to be convincing. The experiment I would like to see is shuffling all variables, and/or negating half the variables, rather than swapping a single pair of variables. Even then, the experiment should optimally measure differences in individual predictions rather than differences in aggregate performance statistics.\n\n\nOne more question:\n- How was N chosen? I only saw the statement \"We choose to determine N dynamically based on the dataset.\"\n\n[1] Crawford and Auton: Experimental results on the crossover point in random 3SAT.
