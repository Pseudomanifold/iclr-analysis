{"title": "Well written paper detailing a slightly different approach to preventing posterior collapse in VAEs.", "review": "The majority of approaches for preventing posterior collapse in VAEs equipped with powerful decoders to better model local structure involve either: alteration of the ELBO training objective, or a restriction on the decoder structure.\n\nThis paper presents an approach which broadly falls into the latter category; by limiting the family of the variational approximation to the posterior, the minimum KL divergence between the prior and posterior is lower bounded to a 'delta' value, preventing collapse.\n\nThe paper is well written, and the methodology clearly explained.\n\nThe experiments show that the proposed approach (delta VAE combined with the 'anti-causal' architecture) captures both local and global structure, and appears to do so while preserving SOTA discriminative performance on some tasks.  Tests are performed on both generative image and language tasks.\n\nI believe that the paper is of low-medium significance: whilst it does outline a different method of restricting the family of posteriors, it does not give a detailed reasoning (empirical or theoretical) as to why this should be a generally better solution as compared to other approaches.\n\nPros:\n- Very clear and well written.\n- Good execution and ablation/experimentation section.\n\nCons:\n- Lack of theory (and minimal experimentation) as to why this approach should be better than competing methods.\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}
