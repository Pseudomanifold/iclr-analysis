{"title": "Interesting results on transfer learning", "review": "The authors proposed an interesting method for parameter-efficient transfer learning and multi-task learning. The authors show that in transfer learning fine-tuning the last layer plus BN layers significantly improve the performance of only fine-tuning the last layer. The results are surprisingly good and the authors also did analysis on the relationship between embedding space and biases. \n\n1. The memory benefit is obvious, it would be interesting to know the training speed compared to fine-tuning methods (both the last layer and the entire network)?\n2. It seems that DW patch has limited effects compared to S/B patch. It would be nice to have some analysis of this aspect.\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}
