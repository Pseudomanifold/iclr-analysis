{"title": "Paper seems quite preliminary and not ready for detailed review", "review": "The paper studies the use of embedding techniques in recommender systems, and shows that item2vec (an item vectorization method) can be replaced by user2vec, as users and items are interchangeable.\n\nThis is a reasonable enough idea, though not sufficient for publication in ICLR. I'd suggest the authors address the following details:\n-- The methodological contribution is too small, and fairly obvious. Not sufficient for this conference.\n-- Only evaluated on one dataset, so unclear whether the results are really representative\n-- Comparisons against a very limited set of similar methods, which are probably not state-of-the-art for this dataset\n-- The results don't seem significant, all methods compared perform almost equally", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
