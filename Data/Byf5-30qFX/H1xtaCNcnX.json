{"title": "Interesting idea but lacking some context and experiments seem to not have any  baselines targeted at the problem", "review": "The authors propose an extension of hindsight replay to settings where the goal is moving. This consists in taking a failed episode and constructing a valid moving goal by searching prior experiences for a compatible goal trajectory. Results are shown on simulated robotic grasping tasks and a toy task introduced by the authors. Authors show improved results compared to other baselines. The authors also show a demonstration of transfering their policies to the real world.\n\nThe algorithm appears very specific and not applicable to all cases with dynamic goals. It would be good if the authors discussed when it can and cannot be applied. My understanding is it would be hard to apply this when the environment changes across episodes as there needs to be matching trajectories. It would also be hard to apply  this for the same reason if there are dynamics chaging the environment (besides the goal). If the goal was following more complex dynamics like teleporting from one place it seems it would again be rather hard to adapt this. I am also wondering if for most practical cases one could construct a heuristic for making the goal trajectory a valid one (not necessarily relying on knowing exact dynamics) thus avoiding the matching step.\n\nThe literature review and the baselines do not appear to consider any other methods designed for dynamic goals. The paper seems to approach the dynamic goal problem as if it was a fresh problem. It would be good to have a better overview of this field and baselines that address this problem as it has certainly been studied in robotics, computer vision, and reinforcement learning. I find this paper hard to assess without a more appropriate context for this problem besides a recently proposed technique for sparse rewards that the authors might want to adapt to it.  I find it difficult to believe that nobody has studied solutions to this problem and solutions specific to that don\u2019t exist.\n\nThe writing is a bit repetitive at times and I do believe the algorithm can be more tersely summarized earlier in the paper. It\u2019s difficult to get the full idea from the Algorithm block.\n\nOverall, I think the paper is borderline. There is several interesting ideas and a new dataset introduced, but I would like to be more convinced that the problems tackled are indeed as hard as the authors claim and to have a better literature review.\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
