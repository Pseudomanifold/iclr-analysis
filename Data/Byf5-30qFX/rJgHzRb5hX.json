{"title": "Review", "review": "This paper proposes a way of extending Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) to dynamic or moving goals. The proposed method (DHER) constructs new successful trajectories from pairs of failed trajectories where the goal accomplished at some point in the first trajectory happens to match the desired goal in the second trajectory. The method is demonstrated to work well in several simulated environments and some qualitative sim2real transfer results to a real robot are also provided.\n\nThe paper is well written and is mostly easy to follow. I liked the idea of combining parts of two trajectories and to the best of my knowledge it is new. It is a simple idea that seems to work well in practice. While DHER has some limitations I think the key ideas will lead to interesting future work.\n\nThe main shortcoming of the paper is that it does not consider other relevant baselines. For example, since the position of the goal is known, why not use a shaped reward as opposed to a sparse reward? The HER paper showed that using sparse rewards with HER can work better than shaped rewards. These findings may or may not transfer to the dynamic goal case so including a shaped reward baseline would make the paper stronger.\n\nSome questions and suggestions on how to improve the paper:\n- It would be good to be more upfront about the limitations of the method. For example, the results on a real robot probably require accurate localization of the gripper and cup. Making this work for precise manipulation will probably require end-to-end training from vision where it\u2019s not obvious DHER would apply.\n- It would be interesting to see quantitative results for the simulated experiments in section 4.5. \n- The performance of DHER on Dy-Reaching seems to degrade in later stages of training (Figures 3a and 5). Do you know what is causing it? DQN or DHER?\n\nOverall, I think this a good paper.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}
