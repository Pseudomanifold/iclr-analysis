{"title": "A GAN-inspired way to watermark (embed special identification code) into deep neural networks.", "review": "The paper considers watermarking neural networks - making them react to a special, hidden to observers patterns in input images.\n\nIn the proposed approach an Encoder E takes an input image, and modifies it to embed the watermark. Then a decoder, D is tasked to find images with the added watermark. The magnitude of the modification is constrained by limiting the distance between the activations of a VGG19 network. The method proposed in the paper seems to be simple and effective on some benchmark datasets.\n\nThe paper is poorly written: the concept of watermaking is only explained on page 2, and the description given refers to a more general use than the one facilitated by the methods in this paper (watermarking is defined to embed a user-defined signal s into a sample whereas the proposed technique can only transmit one bit - the sample has been watermarked or not).  Then. the technique is presented from a GAN perspective, even though the Encoder and Decoder networks cooperate and need a third network to ensure that the watermarking is hard to detect (this third, VGG19 net is revealed only on page 5). This third network seems to be more important than the exact fatty-skinny architecture of the encoder decoder, but its properties are not evaluated in the paper. In fact, without this third network, the proposed approach could just learn to change a single pixel of the image for watermarking purposes, a trivial operation.\n\nFurthermore, the paper lacks proper design goals for the watermarking procedure. This makes it impossible to judge the value of the proposed architectural choices.
